Boris Pasternak

Boris Leonidovich Pasternak (; ) (30 May 1960) was a Soviet Russian poet, novelist, and literary translator. In his native Russian, Pasternak's first book of poems, "My Sister, Life" (1917), is one of the most influential collections ever published in the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian language</a>. Pasternak's translations of <a href="stage%20play">stage play</a>s by <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Schiller</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Calderón de la Barca</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> remain very popular with Russian audiences.

Outside Russia, Pasternak is best known as the author of "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28novel%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" (1957), a novel which takes place between the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">Russian Revolution of 1905</a> and the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. "Doctor Zhivago" was rejected for publication in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a>. At the instigation of <a href="Giangiacomo%20Feltrinelli">Giangiacomo Feltrinelli</a>, "Doctor Zhivago" was smuggled to <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and published in 1957 and distributed with the help of the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> in the rest of Europe. Pasternak was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Literature">Nobel Prize for Literature</a> in 1958, an event which both humiliated and enraged the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were later to accept it in his name in 1988.

Pasternak was born in Moscow on 10 February, (Gregorian), 1890 (Julian 29 January) into a wealthy assimilated Ukrainian Jewish family. His father was the <a href="Post-Impressionist">Post-Impressionist</a> painter, <a href="Leonid%20Pasternak">Leonid Pasternak</a>, professor at the <a href="Moscow%20School%20of%20Painting%2C%20Sculpture%20and%20Architecture">Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture</a>. His mother was <a href="Rosa%20Kaufman">Rosa Kaufman</a>, a concert pianist and the daughter of <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a> industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife. Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters <a href="Lydia%20Pasternak%20Slater">Lydia</a> and Josephine. The family claimed to be descended on the paternal line from <a href="Isaac%20Abrabanel">Isaac Abrabanel</a>, the famous 15th-century <a href="Sephardic%20Jewish">Sephardic Jewish</a> treasurer of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>.

Early Education: Gifted, brilliant, and non-conformist Ukrainian boys were sometimes sent, after the age of twelve and with the consent of their parents, to the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra in the western Ukraine. A famous ancient Orthodox monastery under the protection of Russia, where they learned astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, literature, history, logic, music, and rhetoric free from the influence of the Polish Roman Catholic Church. The great medieval library at Pochayiv had survived Polish Roman Catholic hostility. Sometimes willful boys were recommended after a incident of insubordination to some civil as well as religious authority, which were often the same. From 1904 to 1907 Boris Pasternak was the cloister-mate of Peter Minchakievich (1890–1963). Minchakievich came from an Orthodox Ukrainian family and Pasternak came from a Jewish Ukrainian family. Some confusion has arisen as to Pasternak attending a military academy in his boyhood years. The uniforms of their monastery Cadet Corp were only similar to those of The Czar Alexander the Third Military Academy, as Pasternak and Minchakievich never attended any military academy. Most schools used a distinctive military looking uniform particular to them as was the custom of the time in Eastern Europe and Russia. Boyhood friends, they parted in 1908, friendly but with different politics, never to see each other again. Pasternak went to the Moscow Conservatory to study music (later Germany to study philosophy), and Minchakievich went to L'viv University (L'vov, L'wow) to study history and philosophy. The character of Strelnikov in Dr. Zhivago is a composite character, his bad dimension is based upon Leon Trotsky and his good dimension is based upon Peter Minchakievich. Several of Pasternak's characters are composites. After World War One and the Revolution, fighting for the Provisional or Republican government under Kerensky, and then escaping a Communist jail and execution, Minchakievich trekked across Siberia in 1917 and became an American citizen. Pasternak stayed in Russia. 

In a 1959 letter to <a href="Jacqueline%20de%20Proyart">Jacqueline de Proyart</a>, Pasternak recalled,

Shortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the <a href="Tolstoyan">Tolstoyan</a> Movement. Novelist <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, "my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and ...the whole house was imbued with his spirit."

In a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel "<a href="Resurrection%20%28novel%29">Resurrection</a>". The novel was serialized in the journal "<a href="Niva%20%28magazine%29">Niva</a>" by the publisher <a href="Adolf%20Marks">Fyodor Marx</a>, based in St Petersburg. The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism. To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations. Pasternak wrote,

According to <a href="Max%20Hayward">Max Hayward</a>, "In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at <a href="Astapovo">Astapovo</a>, Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed."

Regular visitors to the Pasternak's home also included <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Scriabin">Alexander Scriabin</a>, <a href="Lev%20Shestov">Lev Shestov</a>, <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>. Pasternak aspired first to be a musician. Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a>. In 1910 he abruptly left for the <a href="Imperial%20Germany">German</a> <a href="University%20of%20Marburg">University of Marburg</a>, where he studied under <a href="Neo-Kantian">Neo-Kantian</a> philosophers <a href="Hermann%20Cohen">Hermann Cohen</a>, <a href="Nicolai%20Hartmann">Nicolai Hartmann</a> and <a href="Paul%20Natorp">Paul Natorp</a>.

Pasternak fell in love with Ida Wissotzkaya, a girl from a notable Moscow family of tea merchants, whose company <a href="Wissotzky%20Tea">Wissotzky Tea</a> was the largest tea company in the world. Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school. He helped her prepare for finals. They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, <a href="Leonid%20Pasternak">Leonid Pasternak</a>, painted her portrait.

Although Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it. He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I. His first book of poems was published later that year. In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida. However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him. She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem "Marburg" (1917):I quivered. I flared up, and then was extinguished. 
I shook. I had made a proposal – but late, 
Too late. I was scared, and she had refused me. 
I pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint.Another failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, "<a href="My%20Sister%2C%20Life">My Sister, Life</a>". His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>'s philosophy. Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as <a href="Rilke">Rilke</a>, <a href="Lermontov">Lermontov</a>, <a href="Pushkin">Pushkin</a> and German-language Romantic poets.

During World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in <a href="Vsevolodovo-Vilve">Vsevolodovo-Vilve</a> near <a href="Perm">Perm</a>, which undoubtedly provided him with material for "Dr. Zhivago" many years later. Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917. According to <a href="Max%20Hayward">Max Hayward</a>,

When it finally was published in 1921, Pasternak's "My Sister, Life" revolutionised Russian poetry. It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of <a href="Osip%20Mandelshtam">Osip Mandelshtam</a>, <a href="Marina%20Tsvetayeva">Marina Tsvetayeva</a> and others.

Following "My Sister, Life", Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle "Rupture" (1921). Both Pro-Soviet writers and their <a href="White%20emigre">White emigre</a> equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration.

In the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with <a href="Rilke">Rilke</a> and <a href="Tsvetayeva">Tsvetayeva</a>. As the 1920s wore on, however, Pasternak increasingly felt that his colourful style was at odds with a less educated readership. He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">Russian Revolution of 1905</a>. He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably "The Childhood of Luvers" and "Safe Conduct".
In 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye (Евгения Лурье), a student at the Art Institute. The following year they had a son, Evgenii.

Evidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his worshipful poem "In Memory of Reissner" presumably written upon the shockingly premature death from typhus of legendary Bolshevik leader <a href="Larisa%20Reisner">Larisa Reisner</a> at age 30 in February of that year.

By 1927, Pasternak's close friends <a href="Vladimir%20Mayakovsky">Vladimir Mayakovsky</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Aseyev">Nikolai Aseyev</a> were advocating the complete subordination of the arts to the needs of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>. In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, "break off relations," with both of them. Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented. He explained,

By 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled "The Second Birth". Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres.

In 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neuhaus, the wife of the Russian pianist <a href="Heinrich%20Neuhaus">Heinrich Neuhaus</a>. They both got divorces and married two years later.

He continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, "Early Trains" (1943).

In April 1934 <a href="Osip%20Mandelstam">Osip Mandelstam</a> recited his "<a href="Stalin%20Epigram">Stalin Epigram</a>" to Pasternak. After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam: "I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up. I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales. So let's make out that I heard nothing."

On the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> boss <a href="Genrikh%20Yagoda">Genrikh Yagoda</a>. Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of "<a href="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>" and begged <a href="Nikolai%20Bukharin">Nikolai Bukharin</a> to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf.

Soon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from <a href="Moscow%20Kremlin">The Kremlin</a> said, "Comrade <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> wishes to speak with you." According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard "his" voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar "thou" form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an "eager fumbling manner" Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin finally said, in a mocking tone of voice: "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," and put down the receiver.

According to Pasternak, during the 1937 <a href="Case%20of%20Trotskyist%20Anti-Soviet%20Military%20Organization">show trial</a> of General <a href="Iona%20Yakir">Iona Yakir</a> and Marshal <a href="Mikhail%20Tukhachevsky">Mikhail Tukhachevsky</a>, the <a href="Union%20of%20Soviet%20Writers">Union of Soviet Writers</a> requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. <a href="Vladimir%20Stavsky">Vladimir Stavski</a>, the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at <a href="Peredelkino">Peredelkino</a> and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his <a href="dacha">dacha</a>. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.

Soon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin. He wrote about his family's strong <a href="Tolstoyan">Tolstoyan</a> convictions, which he still held dear. He declared that his own life was at the Leader's disposal. He said that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death. Pasternak was certain that he would be instantly arrested, but he was not. Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the <a href="Great%20Purge">Great Purge</a>. According to Pasternak, Stalin declared, "Do not touch this cloud dweller" (or, in another version, "Leave that <a href="Foolishness%20for%20Christ">holy fool</a> alone!")

Although Pasternak was never arrested by the <a href="Soviet%20secret%20police">Soviet secret police</a>, his close friend <a href="Titsian%20Tabidze">Titsian Tabidze</a> fell victim to the Great Purge. In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the <a href="suicides">suicides</a> of <a href="Marina%20Tsvetaeva">Marina Tsvetaeva</a> and <a href="Paolo%20Iashvili">Paolo Iashvili</a> as the greatest heartbreaks of his entire life.

Ivinskaya wrote, "I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent <a href="duel">duel</a>."

Pasternak was elated by the outbreak of war between <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the Soviet Union. When the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street. According to Ivinskaya, he repeatedly helped to dispose of German bombs which fell on it.

In 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front. He bore up well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places. He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops.

With the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>, and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges. But, sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>s. Some were <a href="Nazi%20collaborator">Nazi collaborator</a>s who had fought under General <a href="Andrey%20Vlasov">Andrey Vlasov</a>, but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men. Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s. <a href="White%20emigre">White emigre</a>s who had returned due to pledges of <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a> were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the <a href="Jewish%20Anti-Fascist%20Committee">Anti-Fascist Committee</a> and other organizations. Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the <a href="Leningrad%20Affair">Leningrad Affair</a> and the so-called <a href="Doctor%27s%20Plot">Doctor's Plot</a>, while whole ethnic groups were <a href="Population%20transfer%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">deported to Siberia</a>.

Pasternak later said, "If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>. Then, an end to the war in favour of our <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">allies</a>, civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory."

In October 1946, the twice married Pasternak met <a href="Olga%20Ivinskaya">Olga Ivinskaya</a>, a 34 year old single mother employed by "<a href="Novy%20Mir">Novy Mir</a>". Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya, Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations. Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life. Ivinskaya later recalled, "He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was "busy today." But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street. 'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask."

She gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below. In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments.

When they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian <a href="List%20of%20national%20poets">national poet</a>, <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Pet%C5%91fi">Sándor Petőfi</a>. Pasternak gave his lover a book of Petőfi with the inscription, "Petőfi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you. In memory of it all, B.P., 13 May 1948."

Pasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, "Petőfi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still. I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you. Thank you for your help. I was translating both of you." Ivinskaya would later describe the Petőfi translations as, "a first declaration of love."

According to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity. Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya. Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise. Popova told him that he must do it himself. Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her.

Ivinskaya later recalled,

In 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at "Novy Mir", which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship. In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry. In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, "Our Shop."

On the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>. Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the <a href="Korean%20poetry">Korean poet</a> <a href="Won%20Tu-Son">Won Tu-Son</a>. Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence. Ivinskaya was taken to the <a href="Lubyanka%20%28KGB%29">Lubyanka Prison</a> and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak. At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the <a href="GULAG">GULAG</a>.

Upon learning of his <a href="Mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a>' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to <a href="Gogol%20Boulevard">Gogol Boulevard</a>. She found him sitting on a bench near the <a href="Kropotkinskaya">Palace of Soviets Metro Station</a>. Weeping, Pasternak told her, "Everything is finished now. They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again. It's like death, even worse."

According to Ivinskaya, "After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer.' Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with <a href="Anna%20Akhmatova">Akhmatova</a>—who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her. He worked intensively on the second part of "Doctor Zhivago"."

In a 1958 letter to a friend in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, Pasternak wrote, "She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the <a href="KGB">secret police</a> to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial. I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance."

Pasternak's translation of the of "<a href="Goethe%27s%20Faust">Faust</a>" led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of "<a href="Novy%20Mir">Novy Mir</a>". The critic accused Pasternak of distorting <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>'s "progressive" meanings to support "the reactionary theory of 'pure art'", as well as introducing aesthetic and <a href="individualist">individualist</a> values. In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which "Novy Mir" considered, "irrational," had been translated as Goethe had written them. Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the had not been revoked.

When Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>, and Pasternak was in Moscow. Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief. Pasternak wrote, "Men who are not free... always idealize their bondage."

After her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off. Soon after he confided in her, "For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig. The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism. Now we are ruled over by mediocrities." During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s "<a href="Animal%20Farm">Animal Farm</a>" in English. In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator <a href="Napoleon%20%28Animal%20Farm%29">Napoleon</a>, in the novel, "vividly reminded" him of Soviet Premier <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>.

Although it contains passages written in the 1910s and 1920s, "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28novel%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to "Новый Мир" ("<a href="Novy%20Mir">Novy Mir</a>"), which refused publication due to its rejection of <a href="socialist%20realism">socialist realism</a>. The author, like his <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> <a href="Yuri%20Zhivago">Yuri Zhivago</a>, showed more concern for the welfare of individual characters than for the "progress" of society. Censors also regarded some passages as <a href="anti-Soviet">anti-Soviet</a>, especially the novel's criticisms of <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, <a href="Collectivisation">Collectivisation</a>, the <a href="Great%20Purge">Great Purge</a>, and the <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>.

Pasternak's fortunes were soon to change, however. In March 1956, the <a href="Italian%20Communist%20Party">Italian Communist Party</a> sent a journalist, <a href="Sergio%20d%27Angelo">Sergio d'Angelo</a>, to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist <a href="Giangiacomo%20Feltrinelli">Giangiacomo Feltrinelli</a>, had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of "Doctor Zhivago"'s existence, d'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told d'Angelo with a laugh, "You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad."

According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk. No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on <a href="Boris%20Pilnyak">Boris Pilnyak</a> and <a href="Evgeny%20Zamyatin">Evgeny Zamyatin</a>. Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia.

In a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of "Doctor Zhivago" to a Western publishing house. Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see "Doctor Zhivago" published.

In 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company. Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication. According to Ivinskaya, "He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world – this would be an even greater crime." The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams.

Helped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U.S. <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world – see "Nobel Prize" section below), "Doctor Zhivago" became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957. In the <a href="State%20of%20Israel">State of Israel</a>, however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its <a href="assimilationist">assimilationist</a> views towards the <a href="Jewish%20people">Jewish people</a>. When informed of this, Pasternak responded, "No matter. I am above race..." According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence. At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox <a href="Divine%20Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a>. Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into <a href="atheism">atheism</a> and <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>.

The first English translation of "Doctor Zhivago" was hastily produced by <a href="Max%20Hayward">Max Hayward</a> and <a href="Manya%20Harari">Manya Harari</a> in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand. It was released in August 1958, and remained the only edition available for more than fifty years. Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>"' bestseller list.

Ivinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in <a href="Samizdat">Samizdat</a>. Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, "Doctor Zhivago" was pilloried in the State-owned press. Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, "I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him".

During the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a> themes. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, "giant of the pre-Christian era." Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, "a form of protest."

On 9 September 1958, the "Literary Gazette" critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, "the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the <a href="Russian%20Symbolism">Symbolist</a> suitcase of 1908–10 manufacture." Furthermore, the author received much <a href="hate%20mail">hate mail</a> from Communists both at home and abroad. According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life.

In a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading "Doctor Zhivago". She had said, "Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work. It was the <a href="Russian%20people">Russian people</a> and their sufferings who created it. Thank God for having expressed it through your pen."

According to Yevgeni Borisovich Pasternak, "Rumors that Pasternak was to receive the Nobel Prize started right after the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. According to the former Nobel Committee head <a href="Lars%20Gyllensten">Lars Gyllensten</a>, his nomination was discussed every year from 1946 to 1950, then again in 1957 (it was finally awarded in 1958). Pasternak guessed at this from the growing waves of criticism in USSR. Sometimes he had to justify his European fame: 'According to the Union of Soviet Writers, some literature circles of the West see unusual importance in my work, not matching its modesty and low productivity…'"

According to journalist Ivan Tolstoi, the British <a href="MI6">MI6</a> and the American <a href="CIA">CIA</a> lent a hand to ensure that "Doctor Zhivago" was submitted to the <a href="Nobel%20Committee">Nobel Committee</a> in the original Russian. According to Tolstoi, this was done so that Pasternak could win the Nobel prize and harm the international credibility of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. He repeats and elaborates upon Feltrinelli's claims that the CIA operatives had photographed a manuscript of the novel and secretly printed a small number of books in the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian language</a>. More recently, Anna Sergeyeva-Klyatis wrote that the first Russian edition of "Doctor Zhivago", which was a pirated version with numerous typographical errors and omissions, was actually initiated by the Central Association of Postwar Émigrées, in response to a growing demand among Russian émigrés.

The issue of whether or not the CIA had a hand in creating the international controversy that led to Pasternak's winning the Nobel Prize was definitively settled on 11 April 2014 when the U.S. <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> released "nearly 100 declassified documents" confirming that it had, in fact, undertaken a massive propaganda campaign to influence the Nobel Prize committee to consider "Zhivago" for the award, starting as early as 12 December 1957: ""Dr. Zhivago" should be published in a maximum number of foreign editions, for maximum free world discussion and acclaim and consideration for such honor as the Nobel prize" [sic] In order to turn Pasternak's novel into an international bestseller worthy of consideration for the Nobel Prize, the CIA purchased thousands of copies of the novel as they came off the presses throughout Europe. When in the summer of 1958 the Dutch publishing house of Mouton brought out an edition of "Zhivago", the CIA secretly arranged to "obtain first thousand copies of the book off the press and of these send 500 copies to the Brussels Fair" (i.e., the <a href="Expo%2058">World Fair</a> held that summer in Brussels, Belgium). In its announcement of the declassification of the "Zhivago" documents the CIA states that it also published "thousands" of copies of "Zhivago" and gave them out to Soviet tourists on holiday in Western Europe and had them smuggled into the Soviet Union: "After working secretly to publish the Russian-language edition in the Netherlands, the CIA moved quickly to ensure that copies of Doctor Zhivago were available for distribution to Soviet visitors at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. By the end of the Fair, 355 copies of Doctor Zhivago had been surreptitiously handed out, and eventually thousands more were distributed throughout the Communist bloc. [...] Subsequently, the CIA funded the publication of a miniature, lightweight paperback edition of Doctor Zhivago that could be easily mailed or concealed in a jacket pocket. Distribution of the miniature version began in April 1959."

Meanwhile, Pasternak wrote to Renate Schweitzer and his sister, <a href="Lydia%20Pasternak%20Slater">Lydia Pasternak Slater</a>. In both letters, the author expressed hope that he would be passed over by the Nobel Committee in favour of <a href="Alberto%20Moravia">Alberto Moravia</a>. Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger.

On 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize. The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in, "continuing the great Russian epic tradition." On 25 October, Pasternak sent a <a href="telegram">telegram</a> to the <a href="Swedish%20Academy">Swedish Academy</a>: "Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed." That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel. They were further ordered to join a "spontaneous" demonstration demanding Pasternak's exile from the Soviet Union. On 26 October, the "Literary Gazette" ran an article by David Zaslavski entitled, "<a href="Reactionary">Reactionary</a> Propaganda Uproar over a Literary Weed".

According to <a href="Solomon%20Volkov">Solomon Volkov</a>:

Furthermore, Pasternak was informed that, if he traveled to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> to collect his Nobel Medal, he would be refused re-entry to the Soviet Union. As a result, Pasternak sent a second telegram to the Nobel Committee: "In view of the meaning given the award by the society in which I live, I must renounce this undeserved distinction which has been conferred on me. Please do not take my voluntary renunciation amiss." The Swedish Academy announced: "This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award. There remains only for the Academy, however, to announce with regret that the presentation of the Prize cannot take place."

According to Yevgenii Pasternak, "I couldn't recognize my father when I saw him that evening. Pale, lifeless face, tired painful eyes, and only speaking about the same thing: 'Now it all doesn’t matter, I declined the Prize.'"

Despite his decision to decline the award, the Soviet Union of Writers continued to demonise Pasternak in the State-owned press. Furthermore, he was threatened at the very least with formal exile to the West. In response, Pasternak wrote directly to Soviet Premier <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>,

In "The Oak and the Calf", <a href="Alexander%20Solzhenitsyn">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> sharply criticized Pasternak, both for declining the Nobel Prize and for sending such a letter to Khrushchev. In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions.

According to Yevgenii Pasternak, "She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize. After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can... understand her: the memory of Stalin's camps was too fresh, [and] she tried to protect him."

On 31 October 1958, the <a href="Union%20of%20Soviet%20Writers">Union of Soviet Writers</a> held a trial behind closed doors. According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal <a href="White%20emigre">White emigre</a> and a Fascist <a href="fifth%20columnist">fifth columnist</a>. Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union. They further signed a petition to the <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a>, demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, "his Capitalist paradise." According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author <a href="Konstantin%20Paustovsky">Konstantin Paustovsky</a> refused to attend the meeting. <a href="Yevgeny%20Yevtushenko">Yevgeny Yevtushenko</a> did attend, but walked out in disgust.

According to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to find a Committee for Pasternak's protection.

It is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.

Meanwhile, <a href="Bill%20Mauldin">Bill Mauldin</a> produced a <a href="political%20cartoon">political cartoon</a> which won the 1959 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Editorial%20Cartooning">Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning</a>. The cartoon depicts Pasternak and another <a href="GULAG">GULAG</a> inmate, splitting trees in the snow. The caption reads, "I won the Nobel Prize for literature. What was your crime?"

Pasternak's post-"Zhivago" poetry probes the universal questions of love, immortality, and reconciliation with God. Boris Pasternak wrote his last complete book, "When the Weather Clears", in 1959.

According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to stick to his daily writing schedule even during the controversy over "Doctor Zhivago". He also continued translating the writings of <a href="Juliusz%20S%C5%82owacki">Juliusz Słowacki</a> and <a href="Pedro%20Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Pedro Calderón de la Barca</a>. In his work on Calderon, Pasternak received the discreet support of Nikolai Mikhailovich Liubimov, a senior figure in the Party's literary apparatus. Ivinskaya describes Liubimov as, "a shrewd and enlightened person who understood very well that all the mudslinging and commotion over the novel would be forgotten, but that there would always be a Pasternak." In a letter to his sisters in Oxford, England, Pasternak claimed to have finished translating one of Calderon's plays in less than a week.

During the summer of 1959, Pasternak began writing "The Blind Beauty", a trilogy of <a href="stage%20play">stage play</a>s set before and after <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>'s abolition of <a href="serfdom%20in%20Russia">serfdom in Russia</a>. In an interview with <a href="Olga%20Carlisle">Olga Carlisle</a> from "<a href="The%20Paris%20Review">The Paris Review</a>", Pasternak enthusiastically described the play's plot and characters. He informed Olga Carlisle that, at the end of "The Blind Beauty", he wished to depict "the birth of an enlightened and affluent middle class, open to occidental influences, progressive, intelligent, artistic". However, Pasternak fell ill with terminal lung cancer before he could complete the first play of the trilogy.

Boris Pasternak died of lung cancer in his <a href="dacha">dacha</a> in Peredelkino on the evening of 30 May 1960. He first summoned his sons, and in their presence said, "Who will suffer most because of my death? Who will suffer most? Only Oliusha will, and I haven't had time to do anything for her. The worst thing is that she will suffer." Pasternak's last words were, "I can't hear very well. And there's a mist in front of my eyes. But it will go away, won't it? Don't forget to open the window tomorrow."

Shortly before his death, a priest of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> had given Pasternak the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a>. Later, in the strictest secrecy, a <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church%23Liturgy">Russian Orthodox funeral liturgy</a>, or <a href="Panikhida">Panikhida</a>, was offered in the family's dacha.

Despite only a small notice appearing in the "Literary Gazette", handwritten notices carrying the date and time of the funeral were posted throughout the Moscow subway system. As a result, thousands of admirers braved Militia and KGB surveillance to attend Pasternak's funeral in Peredelkino.

Before Pasternak's civil funeral, Olga Ivinskaya had a conversation with <a href="Konstantin%20Paustovsky">Konstantin Paustovsky</a>. According to Ivinskaya,

Then, in the presence of a large number of foreign journalists, the body of Pasternak was removed to the cemetery. According to Ivinskaya,

To the horror of the assembled Party officials, however, someone with "a young and deeply anguished voice" began reciting Pasternak's banned poem "Hamlet".
According to Ivinskaya,

The final speaker at the graveside service said,

As the spectators cheered, the bells of Peredelkino's Church of the Transfiguration began to toll. Written prayers for the dead were then placed upon Pasternak's forehead and the coffin was closed and buried. Pasternak's gravesite would go on to become a major shrine for members of the <a href="Soviet%20dissident">Soviet dissident</a> movement.

After Pasternak's death, <a href="Olga%20Ivinskaya">Olga Ivinskaya</a> was arrested for the second time, with her daughter, Irina Emelyanova. Both were accused of being Pasternak's link with Western publishers and of dealing in hard currency for "Doctor Zhivago". All of Pasternak's letters to Ivinskaya, as well as many other manuscripts and documents, were seized by the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>. The <a href="KGB">KGB</a> quietly released them, Irina after one year, in 1962, and Olga in 1964. By this time, Ivinskaya had served four years of an eight-year sentence, in retaliation for her role in "Doctor Zhivago"'s publication. In 1978, her memoirs were smuggled abroad and published in Paris. An English translation by <a href="Max%20Hayward">Max Hayward</a> was published the same year under the title "A Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak".

Ivinskaya was <a href="Rehabilitation%20%28Soviet%29">rehabilitated</a> only in 1988. After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, Ivinskaya sued for the return of the letters and documents seized by the KGB in 1961. The <a href="Russian%20Supreme%20Court">Russian Supreme Court</a> ultimately ruled against her, stating that, "there was no proof of ownership," and that the, "papers should remain in the state archive". Olga Ivinskaya died of cancer on 8 September 1995. A reporter on <a href="NTV%20%28Russia%29">NTV</a> compared her role to that of other famous <a href="muse">muse</a>s for Russian poets: "As <a href="Pushkin">Pushkin</a> would not be complete without <a href="Anna%20Kern">Anna Kern</a>, and <a href="Yesenin">Yesenin</a> would be nothing without Isadora, so Pasternak would not be Pasternak without <a href="Olga%20Ivinskaya">Olga Ivinskaya</a>, who was his inspiration for "Doctor Zhivago".".

Meanwhile, Boris Pasternak continued to be pilloried by the Soviet State until <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> proclaimed <a href="Perestroika">Perestroika</a> during the 1980s.

In 1988, after decades of circulating in <a href="Samizdat">Samizdat</a>, "Doctor Zhivago" was serialized in the literary journal "<a href="Novy%20Mir">Novy Mir</a>".

In December 1989, Yevgenii Borisovich Pasternak was permitted to travel to Stockholm in order to collect his father's Nobel Medal. At the ceremony, acclaimed cellist and Soviet dissident <a href="Mstislav%20Rostropovich">Mstislav Rostropovich</a> performed a <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> serenade in honor of his deceased countryman.

A 2009 book by Ivan Tolstoi reasserts claims that British and American intelligence officers were involved in ensuring Pasternak's Nobel victory however another Russian researcher disagrees. When Yevgeny Borisovich Pasternak was questioned about this, he responded that his father was completely unaware of the actions of Western intelligence services. Yevgeny further declared that the Nobel Prize caused his father nothing but severe grief and harassment at the hands of the Soviet State.

The Pasternak family papers are stored at the <a href="Hoover%20Institution">Hoover Institution</a> Archives, <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>. They contain correspondence, drafts of "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28novel%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" and other writings, photographs, and other material, of Boris Pasternak and other family members.


The first <a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%281965%20film%29">screen adaptation</a> of "Doctor Zhivago", adapted by <a href="Robert%20Bolt">Robert Bolt</a> and directed by <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>, appeared in 1965. The film, which toured in the <a href="roadshow">roadshow</a> tradition, starred <a href="Omar%20Sharif">Omar Sharif</a>, <a href="Geraldine%20Chaplin">Geraldine Chaplin</a>, and <a href="Julie%20Christie">Julie Christie</a>. Concentrating on the <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until <a href="Perestroika">Perestroika</a>.

In 2002, the novel was adapted as a <a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28TV%20serial%29">television miniseries</a>. Directed by Giacomo Campiotti, the serial starred <a href="Hans%20Matheson">Hans Matheson</a>, <a href="Alexandra%20Maria%20Lara">Alexandra Maria Lara</a>, <a href="Keira%20Knightley">Keira Knightley</a>, and <a href="Sam%20Neill">Sam Neill</a>.

The Russian TV version of 2006, directed by <a href="Alexander%20Proshkin">Alexander Proshkin</a> and starring <a href="Oleg%20Menshikov">Oleg Menshikov</a> as Zhivago, is considered more faithful to Pasternak's novel than David Lean's 1965 film.

According to Ivinskaya:

For this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse. According to Ivinskaya, "It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry.'"

Also according to Ivinskaya, "'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed – by 'they' he meant the Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the "Literary Gazette": 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there – it would be better to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today."

Reluctant to conform to <a href="Socialist%20Realism">Socialist Realism</a>, Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family. He soon produced acclaimed translations of <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Pet%C5%91fi">Sándor Petőfi</a>, <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>, <a href="Paul%20Verlaine">Paul Verlaine</a>, <a href="Taras%20Shevchenko">Taras Shevchenko</a>, and <a href="Nikoloz%20Baratashvili">Nikoloz Baratashvili</a>. <a href="Osip%20Mandelstam">Osip Mandelstam</a>, however, privately warned him, "Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work."

In a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, "I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation. The work of Lozinski, Radlova, <a href="Samuil%20Marshak">Marshak</a>, and <a href="Kornei%20Chukovsky">Chukovski</a> is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth. I share the nineteenth century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach."

According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text. He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths.

Pasternak's translations of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> ("<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>", "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>", "King Henry IV" (Parts I and II), "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>", "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>") remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues. Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of "pasternakizing" Shakespeare. In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, "Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort. Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day. In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author. Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience."

According to Ivinskaya:

While they were both collaborating on translating <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a> from <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a> into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, "1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">meters</a>, mostly ternary ones. You may allow yourself to use <a href="assonance">assonance</a>s."

Later, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of <a href="V%C3%ADt%C4%9Bzslav%20Nezval">Vítězslav Nezval</a>, Pasternak told Ivinskaya:

According to <a href="Olga%20Ivinskaya">Olga Ivinskaya</a>, however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak. She later recalled:

Boris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it. He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a> and <a href="Theodor%20Leschetizky">Theodor Leschetizky</a>, and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home. The family had a <a href="dacha">dacha</a> – country house – close to one occupied by <a href="Alexander%20Scriabin">Alexander Scriabin</a>; <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a> and <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> were all visitors to the family home. His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Scriabin%29">Symphony No. 3, "The Divine Poem"</a>, in 1903.

Pasternak began to compose at the age of 13. The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but – inspired by Scriabin – he entered the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a>, but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in <a href="Marburg%20University">Marburg University</a>. Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by <a href="Alexander%20Blok">Alexander Blok</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Futurists">Russian Futurists</a>, the same year.

Pasternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin. His single-movement "Piano Sonata" of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice. Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis. Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Raiki, some 27 miles north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students. (NB. This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at <a href="Peredelkino">Peredelkino</a>, which is about 16 miles south-west of the capital.)

<doc id="4668" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4668" title="Binomial coefficient">
Binomial coefficient

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, any of the positive <a href="integer">integer</a>s that occurs as a <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a> in the <a href="binomial%20theorem">binomial theorem</a> is a binomial coefficient. Commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers and is written formula_1. It is the <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a> of the term in the <a href="polynomial%20expansion">polynomial expansion</a> of the <a href="binomial%20%28polynomial%29">binomial</a> <a href="exponentiation">power</a> , which is equal to formula_2. Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of , and in which ranges from 0 to , gives a triangular array called <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>.

The binomial coefficients occur in many areas of mathematics, especially in the field of <a href="combinatorics">combinatorics</a>.

formula_1 is often read aloud as " choose ", because there are formula_1 ways to choose a subset of size elements, disregarding their order, from a set of elements. The properties of binomial coefficients have led to extending the definition to beyond the common case of integers .

<a href="Andreas%20von%20Ettingshausen">Andreas von Ettingshausen</a> introduced the notation formula_1 in 1826, although the numbers were known centuries earlier (see <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by <a href="Halayudha">Halayudha</a>, on an ancient <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> text, <a href="Pingala">Pingala</a>'s "Chandaḥśāstra". In about 1150, the Indian mathematician <a href="Bhaskaracharya">Bhaskaracharya</a> gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book "<a href="L%C4%ABl%C4%81vat%C4%AB">Līlāvatī</a>".

Alternative notations include , , , , , and in all of which the stands for "<a href="combination">combination</a>s" or "choices". Many calculators use variants of the because they can represent it on a single-line display. In this form the binomial coefficients are easily compared to <a href="permutation%23k-permutations%20of%20n">-permutations of</a>, written as , etc.

For <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s (taken to include 0) "n" and "k", the binomial coefficient formula_1 can be defined as the <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a> of the <a href="monomial">monomial</a> "X" in the expansion of . The same coefficient also occurs (if ) in the <a href="binomial%20formula">binomial formula</a>

(valid for any elements "x","y" of a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a>),
which explains the name "binomial coefficient".

Another occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that "k" objects can be chosen from among "n" objects; more formally, the number of "k"-element subsets (or "k"-<a href="combination">combination</a>s) of an "n"-element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the "n" factors of the power one temporarily labels the term "X" with an index "i" (running from 1 to "n"), then each subset of "k" indices gives after expansion a contribution "X", and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that formula_1 is a natural number for any natural numbers "n" and "k". There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of "n" <a href="bit">bit</a>s (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is "k" is given by formula_1, while the number of ways to write formula_9 where every "a" is a nonnegative integer is given by formula_10. Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting "k"-combinations.

Several methods exist to compute the value of formula_1 without actually expanding a binomial power or counting "k"-combinations.

One method uses the <a href="recursion">recursive</a>, purely additive, formula

with initial/boundary values

The formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…,"n"} and counting separately (a) the "k"-element groupings that include a particular set element, say ""i"", in every group (since ""i"" is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose "k" − 1 from the remaining "n" − 1) and (b) all the "k"-groupings that don't include ""i""; this enumerates all the possible "k"-combinations of "n" elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to "X" in . As there is zero "X" or "X" in , one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include formula_1 = 0 when either "k" > "n" or "k" < 0. This recursive formula then allows the construction of <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>, surrounded by white spaces where the zeros, or the trivial coefficients, would be.

A more efficient method to compute individual binomial coefficients is given by the formula

where the numerator of the first fraction formula_16 is expressed as a <a href="falling%20factorial%20power">falling factorial power</a>.
This formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients.
The numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of "k" distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of "n" objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same "k"-combination when order is disregarded.

Due to the symmetry of the binomial coefficient with regard to "k" and "n"−"k", calculation may be optimised by setting the upper limit of the product above to the smaller of "k" and "n"−"k".

Finally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar <a href="factorial">factorial</a> function:

where "n"! denotes the factorial of "n". This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by ; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator. It is less practical for explicit computation (in the case that "k" is small and "n" is large) unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)

which leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the <a href="Pochhammer%20symbol">falling factorial notation</a>,

The multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extended by replacing "n" by an arbitrary number "α" (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> in which all positive integers are invertible:

With this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the formula_20 binomial coefficients:

This formula is valid for all complex numbers "α" and "X" with |"X"| < 1. It can also be interpreted as an identity of <a href="formal%20power%20series">formal power series</a> in "X", where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to 1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a>, notably

If "α" is a nonnegative integer "n", then all terms with "k" > "n" are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However, for other values of "α", including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.

<a href="Pascal%27s%20rule">Pascal's rule</a> is the important <a href="recurrence%20relation">recurrence relation</a>

which can be used to prove by <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a> that formula_22 is a natural number for all "n" and "k", a fact that is not immediately obvious from <a href="%23Definition_and_interpretations">formula (1)</a>.

Pascal's rule also gives rise to <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>:

Row number "n" contains the numbers formula_22 for "k" = 0,…,"n". It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that
The differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation () above.

Binomial coefficients are of importance in <a href="combinatorics">combinatorics</a>, because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:

For any nonnegative integer "k", the expression formula_30 can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by "k"!:

this presents a <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> in "t" with <a href="rational%20number">rational</a> coefficients.

As such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number "t" to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments.
These "generalized binomial coefficients" appear in <a href="Binomial%20theorem%23Newton%27s%20generalized%20binomial%20theorem">Newton's generalized binomial theorem</a>.

For each "k", the polynomial formula_32 can be characterized as the unique degree "k" polynomial "p"("t") satisfying "p"(0) = "p"(1) = ... = "p"("k" − 1) = 0 and "p"("k") = 1.

Its coefficients are expressible in terms of <a href="Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind">Stirling numbers of the first kind</a>:
The <a href="derivative">derivative</a> of formula_32 can be calculated by <a href="logarithmic%20differentiation">logarithmic differentiation</a>:

Over any <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> of <a href="characteristic%20%28algebra%29">characteristic 0</a> (that is, any field that contains the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s), each polynomial "p"("t") of degree at most "d" is uniquely expressible as a linear combination formula_36 of binomial coefficients. The coefficient "a" is the <a href="finite%20difference">"k"th difference</a> of the sequence "p"(0), "p"(1), …, "p"("k").
Explicitly,

Each polynomial formula_32 is <a href="integer-valued%20polynomial">integer-valued</a>: it has an integer value at all integer inputs formula_38.
Therefore, any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too.
Conversely, () shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials.
More generally, for any subring "R" of a characteristic 0 field "K", a polynomial in "K"["t"] takes values in "R" at all integers if and only if it is an "R"-linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.

The integer-valued polynomial 3"t"(3"t" + 1)/2 can be rewritten as

The factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients. For instance, if "k" is a positive integer and "n" is arbitrary, then

and, with a little more work,
Moreover, the following may be useful:
For constant "n", we have the following recurrence:

The formula

is obtained from () by setting "x" = 1 and "y" = 1. This is equivalent to saying that the elements in one row of Pascal's triangle always add up to two raised to an integer power. A combinatorial interpretation of this fact involving <a href="double%20counting%20%28proof%20technique%29">double counting</a> is given by counting subsets of size 0, size 1, size 2, and so on up to size "n" of a set "S" of "n" elements. Since we count the number of subsets of size "i" for 0 ≤ "i" ≤ "n", this sum must be equal to the number of subsets of "S", which is known to be 2. That is, () is the statement that the <a href="power%20set">power set</a> of a finite set with "n" elements has size 2.
More explicitly, consider a bit string with "n" digits. This bit string can be used to represent 2 numbers. Now consider all of the bit strings with no ones in them. There is just one, or rather "n" choose 0. Next consider the number of bit strings with just a single one in them. There are "n", or rather "n" choose 1. Continuing this way we can see that the equation above holds.

The formulas

and
formula_43
follow from () after <a href="derivative">differentiating</a> with respect to "x" (twice in the latter) and then substituting "x" = 1.

The <a href="Chu%E2%80%93Vandermonde%20identity">Chu–Vandermonde identity</a>, which holds for any complex-values "m" and "n" and any non-negative integer "k", is

and can be found by examination of the coefficient of formula_44 in the expansion of (1 + "x") (1 + "x") = (1 + "x") using equation (). When "m" = 1, equation () reduces to equation (). In the special case "n" = 2"m", "k" = "m", using (), the expansion () becomes (as seen in Pascal's triangle at right)
where the term on the right side is a <a href="central%20binomial%20coefficient">central binomial coefficient</a>.

Another form of the Chu–Vandermonde identity, which applies for any integers "j", "k", and "n" satisfying 0 ≤ "j" ≤ "k" ≤ "n", is

The proof is similar, but uses the binomial series expansion () with negative integer exponents.
When "j" = "k", equation () gives the <a href="hockey-stick%20identity">hockey-stick identity</a>

Let "F"("n") denote the "n"-th <a href="Fibonacci%20number">Fibonacci number</a>.
Then
This can be proved by <a href="mathematical%20induction">induction</a> using () or by <a href="Zeckendorf%27s%20theorem">Zeckendorf's representation</a>. A combinatorial proof is given below.

For integers "s" and "t" such that formula_47, <a href="series%20multisection">series multisection</a> gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients:

For small "s", these series have particularly nice forms; for example,

formula_49

formula_50

formula_51

formula_52

formula_53

formula_54

formula_55

Although there is no closed formula for partial sums

of binomial coefficients, one can again use () and induction to show that for "k" = 0, ..., "n" − 1,

with special case

for "n" > 0. This latter result is also a special case of the result from the theory of <a href="finite%20differences">finite differences</a> that for any polynomial "P"("x") of degree less than "n",
Differentiating () "k" times and setting "x" = −1 yields this for
formula_60,
when 0 ≤ "k" < "n",
and the general case follows by taking linear combinations of these.

When "P"("x") is of degree less than or equal to "n",

where formula_61 is the coefficient of degree "n" in "P"("x").

More generally for (),
where "m" and "d" are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying () to the polynomial "Q(x):=P(m + dx)" instead of "P(x)", and observing that "Q(x)" has still degree less than or equal to "n", and that its coefficient of degree "n" is "da".

The <a href="series%20%28mathematics%29">series</a>
formula_63 is convergent for "k" ≥ 2. This formula is used in the analysis of the <a href="German%20tank%20problem">German tank problem</a>. It follows from formula_64
which is proved by <a href="mathematical%20induction">induction</a> on "M".

Many identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by <a href="combinatorial%20proof">combinatorial means</a>. For example, the following identity for nonnegative integers formula_65 (which reduces to () when "q" = 1):

can be given a <a href="double%20counting%20%28proof%20technique%29">double counting proof</a>, as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of ["n"] = {1, 2, …, n} with at least "q" elements, and marking "q" elements among those selected. The right side counts the same parameter, because there are formula_67 ways of choosing a set of "q" marks and they occur in all subsets that additionally contain some subset of the remaining elements, of which there are formula_68

In the Pascal's rule
both sides count the number of "k"-element subsets of ["n"]: the two terms on the right side group them into those that contain element "n" and those that do not.

The identity () also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads

Suppose you have formula_71 empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) "n" of them. There are formula_72 ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your "n" squares by selecting "k" squares from among the first "n" and formula_73 squares from the remaining "n" squares; any "k" from 0 to "n" will work. This gives
Now apply () to get the result.

The identity 

has the following combinatorial proof. The number formula_76 denotes the number of paths in a two-dimensional lattice from formula_77 to formula_78 using steps formula_79 and formula_80. This is easy to see: there are formula_81 steps in total and one may choose the formula_82 formula_80 steps. Now, replace each formula_80 step by a formula_85 step; note that there are exactly formula_82. Then one arrives at point formula_87 using steps formula_79 and formula_85. Doing this for all formula_82 between formula_91 and formula_92 gives all paths from formula_77 to formula_87 using steps formula_79 and formula_85. Clearly, there are exactly formula_97 such paths.

The number of "k"-<a href="Combination%23Number%20of%20k-combinations%20for%20all%20k">combinations</a> for all "k", formula_98, is the sum of the "n"th row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients. These combinations are enumerated by the 1 digits of the set of <a href="base%202">base 2</a> numbers counting from 0 to formula_99, where each digit position is an item from the set of "n".

<a href="Dixon%27s%20identity">Dixon's identity</a> is

or, more generally,

where "a", "b", and "c" are non-negative integers.

Certain trigonometric integrals have values expressible in terms of
binomial coefficients:

For formula_102

These can be proved by using <a href="Euler%27s%20formula">Euler's formula</a> to convert <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a> to complex exponentials, expanding using the binomial theorem, and integrating term by term.

For a fixed "n", the <a href="ordinary%20generating%20function">ordinary generating function</a> of the sequence formula_106 is:

For a fixed "k", the ordinary generating function of the sequence formula_108 is:

The <a href="bivariate%20generating%20function">bivariate generating function</a> of the binomial coefficients is:

Another bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients, which is symmetric, is:

A symmetric <a href="exponential%20generating%20function">exponential bivariate generating function</a> of the binomial coefficients is:

In 1852, <a href="Ernst%20Kummer">Kummer</a> proved that if "m" and "n" are nonnegative integers and "p" is a prime number, then the largest power of "p" dividing formula_113 equals "p", where "c" is the number of carries when "m" and "n" are added in base "p".
Equivalently, the exponent of a prime "p" in formula_24
equals the number of nonnegative integers "j" such that the <a href="fractional%20part">fractional part</a> of "k"/"p" is greater than the fractional part of "n"/"p". It can be deduced from this that formula_24 is divisible by "n"/<a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">gcd</a>("n","k"). In particular therefore it follows that "p" divides formula_116 for all positive integers "r" and "s" such that "s" < "p". However this is not true of higher powers of "p": for example 9 does not divide formula_117.

A somewhat surprising result by <a href="David%20Singmaster">David Singmaster</a> (1974) is that any integer divides <a href="almost%20all">almost all</a> binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer "d" and let "f"("N") denote the number of binomial coefficients formula_24 with "n" < "N" such that "d" divides formula_24. Then
Since the number of binomial coefficients formula_24 with "n" < "N" is "N"("N" + 1) / 2, this implies that the density of binomial coefficients divisible by "d" goes to 1.

Another fact:
An integer "n" ≥ 2 is prime if and only if
all the intermediate binomial coefficients
are divisible by "n".

Proof:
When "p" is prime, "p" divides
because formula_124 is a natural number and "p" divides the numerator but not the denominator.
When "n" is composite, let "p" be the smallest prime factor of "n" and let "k" = n/p. Then 0 < "p" < "n" and
otherwise the numerator "k"("n" − 1)("n" − 2)×...×("n" − "p" + 1) has to be divisible by "n" = "k"×"p", this can only be the case when ("n" − 1)("n" − 2)×...×("n" − "p" + 1) is divisible by "p". But "n" is divisible by "p", so "p" does not divide "n" − 1, "n" − 2, ..., "n" − "p" + 1 and because "p" is prime, we know that "p" does not divide ("n" − 1)("n" − 2)×...×("n" − "p" + 1) and so the numerator cannot be divisible by "n".

The following bounds for formula_24 hold for all values of "n" and "k" such that for 1 ≤ "k" ≤ "n":

<a href="Stirling%27s%20approximation">Stirling's approximation</a> yields the following approximation, when formula_128 are sufficiently large:

In particular, when formula_130 is sufficiently large:

Also:

For both formula_130 and formula_82 much larger than 1, <a href="Stirling%27s%20approximation">Stirling's approximation</a> also yields the following asymptotic approximation:

where formula_137 is the <a href="binary%20entropy%20function">binary entropy</a> of formula_138.
More precisely, for all integers formula_139 with formula_140, we can estimate the sum of the first formula_141 binomial coefficients as follows:

When formula_130 is large and formula_82 is much smaller than formula_130, one can also write

and therefore

If more precision is desired, one can approximate formula_148 with an integral, obtaining

For formula_150 and formula_151, formula_152, and these approximations yield 12.312 and 12.133 respectively.

The infinite product formula (cf. <a href="Gamma%20function%23Alternative%20definitions">Gamma function, alternative definition</a>)
yields the asymptotic formulas
as formula_155.

This asymptotic behaviour is contained in the approximation
as well. (Here formula_157 is the "k"-th <a href="harmonic%20number">harmonic number</a> and formula_158 is the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni%20constant">Euler–Mascheroni constant</a>.)

Further, the asymptotic formula
hold true, whenever formula_160 and formula_161 for some complex number formula_162.

A simple and rough upper bound for the sum of binomial coefficients can be obtained using the <a href="binomial%20theorem">binomial theorem</a>:

If "n" is large and "k" is linear in "n", various precise asymptotic estimates exist for the binomial coefficient formula_164. For example, if formula_165 then
where "d" = "n" − 2"k".

Binomial coefficients can be generalized to multinomial coefficients defined to be the number:
where

While the binomial coefficients represent the coefficients of ("x"+"y"), the multinomial coefficients
represent the coefficients of the polynomial
The case "r" = 2 gives binomial coefficients:

The combinatorial interpretation of multinomial coefficients is distribution of "n" distinguishable elements over "r" (distinguishable) containers, each containing exactly "k" elements, where "i" is the index of the container.

Multinomial coefficients have many properties similar to those of binomial coefficients, for example the recurrence relation:
and symmetry:
where formula_173 is a <a href="permutation">permutation</a> of (1,2...,"r").

Using <a href="Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind">Stirling numbers of the first kind</a> the <a href="Taylor%20series">series expansion</a> around any arbitrarily chosen point formula_174 is

The definition of the binomial coefficients can be extended to the case where formula_130 is real and formula_82 is integer.

In particular, the following identity holds for any non-negative integer formula_82 :

This shows up when expanding formula_180 into a power series using the Newton binomial series :

One can express the product of binomial coefficients as a linear combination of binomial coefficients:

where the connection coefficients are <a href="Multinomial%20theorem">multinomial coefficients</a>. In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign "m+n-k" labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects—of weight "m" and "n" respectively—that have had their first "k" labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight "m+n-k". (That is, to separate the labels into three portions to apply to the glued part, the unglued part of the first object, and the unglued part of the second object.) In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what <a href="falling%20factorial">falling factorial</a>s are to ordinary generating series.

The <a href="partial%20fraction%20decomposition">partial fraction decomposition</a> of the reciprocal is given by

Newton's binomial series, named after <a href="Sir%20Isaac%20Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a>, is a generalization of the binomial theorem to infinite series:

The identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a> (1 + "z") "f"'("z") = α "f"("z").

The <a href="radius%20of%20convergence">radius of convergence</a> of this series is 1. An alternative expression is

where the identity

is applied.

Binomial coefficients count subsets of prescribed size from a given set. A related combinatorial problem is to count <a href="multiset">multiset</a>s of prescribed size with elements drawn from a given set, that is, to count the number of ways to select a certain number of elements from a given set with the possibility of selecting the same element repeatedly. The resulting numbers are called "<a href="Multiset%23Counting%20multisets">multiset coefficients</a>"; the number of ways to "multichoose" (i.e., choose with replacement) "k" items from an "n" element set is denoted formula_188.

To avoid ambiguity and confusion with "n"'s main denotation in this article,<br> let "f" = "n" = "r" + ("k" – 1) and "r" = "f" – ("k" – 1).

Multiset coefficients may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients by the rule
One possible alternative characterization of this identity is as follows:
We may define the <a href="falling%20factorial">falling factorial</a> as
and the corresponding rising factorial as
so, for example,
Then the binomial coefficients may be written as 
while the corresponding multiset coefficient is defined by replacing the falling with the rising factorial:

For any "n",

In particular, binomial coefficients evaluated at negative integers are given by signed multiset coefficients. In the special case formula_196, this reduces to formula_197

For example, if "n" = -4 and "k" = 7, then "r" = 4 and "f" = 10:

The binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the <a href="gamma%20function">gamma function</a> or <a href="beta%20function">beta function</a> via
This definition inherits these following additional properties from formula_200:
moreover,

The resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in . Notably, many binomial identities fail: formula_203 but formula_203 for "n" positive (so formula_205 negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the "x" and "y" axes and the line formula_206), with the behavior for negative "x" having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:

The binomial coefficient has a <a href="q-analog">q-analog</a> generalization known as the <a href="Gaussian%20binomial%20coefficient">Gaussian binomial coefficient</a>.

The definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to <a href="Cardinal%20Number">infinite cardinals</a> by defining:

where A is some set with <a href="cardinality">cardinality</a> formula_215. One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number formula_215, formula_217 will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.

Assuming the <a href="Axiom%20of%20Choice">Axiom of Choice</a>, one can show that formula_218 for any infinite cardinal formula_215.

The notation formula_220 is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a>s and <a href="computer%20terminal">computer terminal</a>s. Many <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s do not offer a standard <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a> for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the <a href="APL%20programming%20language">APL programming language</a> and the (related) <a href="J%20programming%20language">J programming language</a> use the exclamation mark: k ! n .

Naive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>:

from math import factorial
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
are very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> or <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):

<a href="Pascal%27s%20rule">Pascal's rule</a> provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python, although it is less efficient:

def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
The example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following <a href="Scheme%20%28programming%20language%29">Scheme</a> example uses the recursive definition
Rational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division
The following implementation uses all these ideas

 (define (binomial-iter n k i prev)
 (if (< k (- n k))
When computing formula_223 in a language with fixed-length integers, the multiplication by formula_81 may overflow even when the result would fit. The overflow can be avoided by dividing first and fixing the result using the remainder:

Implementation in the C language:
unsigned binomial(unsigned n, unsigned k) {

Another way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that

where formula_227 formula_228 denotes the <a href="natural%20logarithm">natural logarithm</a> of the <a href="gamma%20function">gamma function</a> at formula_130. It is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using "log_gamma" in <a href="Maxima%20%28software%29">Maxima</a>, "LogGamma" in <a href="Mathematica">Mathematica</a>, "gammaln" in <a href="MATLAB">MATLAB</a> and Python's <a href="SciPy">SciPy</a> module, "lngamma" in <a href="PARI/GP">PARI/GP</a> or "lgamma" in <a href="R%20%28programming%20language%29">R</a> and <a href="Julia%20%28programming%20language%29">Julia</a>.

Following his advice and encouragement, Holbrook created a strip in the fall of that year about a college graduate working in a rundown diner. It did not stir syndicate interest, but what he learned on the strip helped him when he created "On the Fastrack".

<doc id="4673" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4673" title="Boy band">
Boy band

A boy band (or boyband) is loosely defined as a <a href="vocal%20group">vocal group</a> consisting of young male singers, usually in their teenage years or in their twenties at the time of formation, singing love songs marketed towards young females. Being vocal groups, most boy band members do not play <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s, either in recording sessions or on stage, making the term something of a <a href="misnomer">misnomer</a>. However, exceptions do exist. Many boy bands dance as well as sing, usually giving highly choreographed performances.

Some such bands form on their own. They can evolve out of church choral or <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a> groups, but are often created by <a href="talent%20manager">talent manager</a>s or record producers who hold auditions. Due to this and their general commercial orientation towards a female audience of <a href="preteen">preteen</a>s, <a href="teenybopper">teenybopper</a>s, or teens, the term may be used with negative connotations in <a href="music%20journalism">music journalism</a>. Boy bands are similar in concept to their counterparts, <a href="girl%20group">girl group</a>s. Boy bands' popularity peaked thrice: in the 1960s (e.g., <a href="The%20Jackson%205">The Jackson 5</a>), in the 1990s and early 2000s when acts such as the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>, <a href="NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>, and <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a>, among others, dominated the top of the "<a href="Billboard%20charts">Billboard</a>" and pop charts, and in the early 2010s with the emergence of new boy bands such as <a href="JLS">JLS</a>, <a href="Big%20Time%20Rush%20%28band%29">Big Time Rush</a> and <a href="One%20Direction">One Direction</a>.

The earliest forerunner of boy band music began in the late 19th century as <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> <a href="barbershop%20quartets">barbershop quartets</a>. They were usually a group of males and sang in <a href="Four%20part%20harmony">four part harmonies</a>. The popularity of barbershop quartets had been prominent into the earlier part of the 20th century. A revival of the male vocal group took place in the late 1940s and 1950s with the use of <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> music. Doo-wop bands sang about topics such as love and other themes used in <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>. The earliest traces of boy bands were in the mid-1950s although the term boy band was not used. <a href="African%20American">African American</a> vocal group <a href="The%20Ink%20Spots">The Ink Spots</a> was one of the first of what would now be called boy bands. The term boy band was not established until the late 1980s as before that they were called male vocal groups or "hep harmony singing groups.

Although the term "boy band" is mostly associated with groups from the 1990s onwards, the earliest predecessors of this format were groups such as <a href="the%20Jackson%205">the Jackson 5</a>, <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>, and <a href="the%20Osmonds">the Osmonds</a> which helped form the template for boy bands. The Jackson 5 were a family group that established many musical conventions that boy bands follow. For instance, their music featured <a href="close%20harmony">close harmonies</a> from <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> and catchy pop hooks influenced as much as they were by <a href="Motown">Motown</a> and acts like <a href="the%20Supremes">the Supremes</a>. All members of the band sang, which is a common convention of a boy band, as opposed to having a front man and the rest on instruments; thus, no one person dominated the stage. Even so, the members conveniently fitted into the convention of having stereotypical personality types (e.g. <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> being the "cute one").

Other antecedents (apart from those already mentioned) exist throughout the history of pop music. The genre has been copied into languages and cultures other than the Anglo-American. The Puerto Rican boy band <a href="Menudo%20%28band%29">Menudo</a>, appealing to young <a href="Latina">Latina</a> audiences, was founded in 1977. Menudo had a convention unique among boy bands: when a member turned 16, became too tall, or their voice changed, they were replaced. The members of Menudo were generally aged 12–17.

The <a href="Bay%20City%20Rollers">Bay City Rollers</a> were a <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> pop band who were most popular in the mid-1970s. The "<a href="British%20Hit%20Singles%20%26amp%3B%20Albums">British Hit Singles & Albums</a>" noted that they were "<a href="tartan">tartan</a> teen sensations from <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>", and were "the first of many acts heralded as the 'Biggest Group since The Beatles' and one of the most screamed-at teeny-bopper acts of the 1970s". For a relatively brief but fervent period (nicknamed "Rollermania"), they were worldwide <a href="teen%20idol">teen idol</a>s. The group were one of the first bands like The Monkees before them to take the formula shown by <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and apply it to a teen market. The group achieved the same amount of success but for a limited period of time. At the peak of their popularity in the UK, comparisons were being made to <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>. Also by this time, Bay City Roller <a href="fan%20%28person%29">fans</a> had a completely distinctive style of dress, the main elements of which were ankle-length <a href="tartan">tartan</a> trousers and tartan <a href="scarf">scarves</a>, the group using the benefit of merchandise and promotion.

In the US, the <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>-based <a href="power%20pop">power pop</a> group <a href="Raspberries%20%28band%29">Raspberries</a> was generally interpreted as a "teen act", although all the band members played their own music. Vocalist <a href="Eric%20Carmen">Eric Carmen</a> later commented, "It was not hip for people to like us, because their little sister liked us."

<a href="Bros">Bros</a> (abbreviation of the word "brothers") were a British boy band active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, consisting of twin brothers <a href="Matt%20Goss">Matt</a> and <a href="Luke%20Goss">Luke Goss</a> along with <a href="Craig%20Logan">Craig Logan</a>. Formed in 1986, they scored multiple top 10 hits between 1987 and 1989. In Britain Bros also became the first modern era–style boy band to have a multiple platinum selling album with "<a href="Push%20%28Bros%20album%29">Push</a>" in 1988, which is still one of the most successful boyband albums in the UK. Other big boy bands in Britain during the late eighties were <a href="Big%20Fun%20%28boyband%29">Big Fun</a> and <a href="Brother%20Beyond">Brother Beyond</a>.

Boston group <a href="New%20Edition">New Edition</a> was formed in 1978 and reached their height of popularity in the 1980s, making them often credited for starting the boy band trend in the 1980s, even though the term "boy band" did not exist until the 1990s. <a href="Maurice%20Starr">Maurice Starr</a> was influenced by New Edition and popularized it with his <a href="Mentorship">protégé</a> <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>, the first commercially successful modern boy band who formed in 1984 and found international success in 1988. Starr's idea was to take the traditional template from the R&B genre (in this case his teenage band New Edition) and apply it to a pop genre.

Some managers in Europe soon created their own acts after being inspired by <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>. First beginning with <a href="Nigel%20Martin-Smith">Nigel Martin-Smith</a>'s <a href="Take%20That">Take That</a> in the UK who formed in 1990 and followed by <a href="Tom%20Watkins%20%28music%20manager%29">Tom Watkins</a> who had success with <a href="Bros">Bros</a> in the late eighties and formed <a href="East%2017">East 17</a> in 1991 who were marketed and pitted against Take That as rivals with a harsher attitude, style and sound. Since reforming after a decade-long hiatus, Take That have become one of the most successful groups in British music chart history. Irish music manager <a href="Louis%20Walsh">Louis Walsh</a>, who had witnessed the impact of these British boy bands, put out an advert for an 'Irish Take That' thereby creating <a href="Boyzone">Boyzone</a> in 1993. <a href="Let%20Loose">Let Loose</a> formed in 1993, <a href="MN8">MN8</a> and <a href="911%20%28UK%20band%29">911</a> formed in 1995, and <a href="Damage%20%28British%20band%29">Damage</a> formed in 1996 were also boy bands who enjoyed success in Britain; however by the late 1990s all these bands had run their course and split up.

All these artists were very successful on both the singles and albums charts domestically and internationally however with the emergence of <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> and the commercial co-option of <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a>, many boy bands were ridiculed by the British music press as having no artistic credibility, although some boy bands, such as East 17 and Take That, did write most of their own material. The media attention was then placed on the "Battle of Britpop" and the bands <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> and <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> replaced the importance and rivalry of Take That and East 17 as the two new biggest bands in Britain. However, other boybands found success in the late nineties like <a href="Five%20%28band%29">Five</a>, <a href="Another%20Level%20%28band%29">Another Level</a>, <a href="Point%20Break%20%28band%29">Point Break</a> and <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a>. In 1995 successful German music manager <a href="Frank%20Farian">Frank Farian</a> who had been manager of <a href="Boney%20M">Boney M</a> and <a href="Milli%20Vanilli">Milli Vanilli</a> put together <a href="Latin%20American">Latin American</a> band <a href="No%20Mercy%20%28pop%20band%29">No Mercy</a> who scored a few worldwide hits during the mid nineties.

Although being American and the sons of <a href="Tito%20Jackson">Tito Jackson</a>, a member of <a href="The%20Jackson%205">The Jackson 5</a>, <a href="3T">3T</a> had several hits singles across Europe in the mid-1990s, despite limited success in the <a href="United%20States">US</a>, and finished the second biggest selling act of 1996 in Europe behind <a href="Spice%20Girls">Spice Girls</a>.

With the success of North American boybands like <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a> in East Asia, Japanese entertainment company <a href="Johnny%20%26amp%3B%20Associates">Johnny & Associates</a> formed <a href="SMAP">SMAP</a> in 1992. The group enjoyed tremendous success, having sold over 35 million records. It paved the way for more Asian boy bands such as <a href="Arashi">Arashi</a>.
In the early 1990s in North America, with New Kids on the Block's continued success and <a href="Color%20Me%20Badd">Color Me Badd</a> also having success, boy bands became a continued staple of the Billboard charts. Continuing this success in the mid-1990s, most prominent boy bands were African American and had R&B and gospel elements, such as the group <a href="All-4-One">All-4-One</a> that formed in 1993 and <a href="Boyz%20II%20Men">Boyz II Men</a> that formed in 1988. Boyz II Men are also the most successful boy band act on the <a href="U.S.%20Hot%20100">U.S. Hot 100</a> as well as the <a href="Australian%20Singles%20Chart">Australian Singles Chart</a>. Although they had success on the Billboard charts, they weren't marketed towards youth but more towards adults. It was not until 1997 and the change to pop oriented groups like <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>, <a href="98%20Degrees">98 Degrees</a>, <a href="NSYNC">NSYNC</a>, <a href="The%20Moffatts">The Moffatts</a>, and <a href="Hanson%20%28band%29">Hanson</a> that boy bands exploded commercially and dominated the market in the United States. This late nineties era marked the height of boy band popularity in North America which hasn't been seen since.

Arguably the most successful boy band manager from the U.S. was <a href="Lou%20Pearlman">Lou Pearlman</a>, who founded commercially successful acts such as the <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> in 1993, <a href="NSYNC">NSYNC</a> and <a href="LFO%20%28group%29">LFO</a> in 1995, <a href="O-Town%20%28band%29">O-Town</a> in 2000, and <a href="US5">US5</a> in 2005. Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became the two biggest boy bands in the late 1990s until the early 2000s, and Backstreet Boys went on to become the best selling boy band in history with over 130 million records sold.

In the late nineties in the UK, producer <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> (noted in the U.S. for the American Idol/X Factor franchise) is also known for having managed British boyband <a href="Five%20%28band%29">Five</a> who were formed in 1997 and Irish boyband <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a> formed in 1998. Westlife was created by Irishman <a href="Louis%20Walsh">Louis Walsh</a> as a replacement for <a href="Boyzone">Boyzone</a> and was initially managed by a former member of the band <a href="Ronan%20Keating">Ronan Keating</a>. Westlife would eventually overtake Take That in number one's tally in the UK although Take That's overall UK sales are still higher. In 2012, the <a href="Official%20Charts%20Company">Official Charts Company</a> revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall and the highest selling boyband act (9.3 million), followed by Boyzone at 29 (7.1 million) and Westlife at 34 (6.8 million). Even though Cowell is known to have managed several successful boy bands, he is also infamous for passing on signing two of the biggest boybands to emerge from the 1990s and 2000s, Take That and <a href="Busted%20%28band%29">Busted</a>.

With the continued success of <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href="NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>, American and British groups like <a href="98%20Degrees">98 Degrees</a>, <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a>, <a href="O-Town%20%28band%29">O-Town</a>, <a href="A1%20%28band%29">A1</a>, <a href="Blue%20%28English%20band%29">Blue</a>, and <a href="Busted%20%28band%29">Busted</a> gained quick popularity both domestically and internationally. International boy bands would also occasionally spring up, such as the <a href="Moldova">Moldova</a>n band <a href="O-Zone">O-Zone</a> (better known today as an <a href="Numa%20numa">Internet meme</a>), and <a href="Overground%20%28band%29">Overground</a>. American Christian boy band <a href="Plus%20One%20%28band%29">Plus One</a> also enjoyed brief remarkable success during this time.

At the height of boy band popularity in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, MTV created their own parody boyband, <a href="2gether%20%28band%29">2gether</a>. Like <a href="The%20Monkees">The Monkees</a> in the 1960s, they were a manufactured act composed of actors. 2gether played off of the idea that every successful boy band must have five distinct personality types: the bad boy, the shy one, the young one, the older brother type, and a heart throb.

Since 2001, the dominance of traditional boy bands on pop charts began to fade in the western hemisphere, although Gil Kaufman of <a href="MTV.com">MTV</a> has described "new boy bands" that are "more likely to resemble <a href="My%20Chemical%20Romance">My Chemical Romance</a>, <a href="Sum%2041">Sum 41</a>, and <a href="Simple%20Plan">Simple Plan</a>.

In 2001, Taiwanese boy band <a href="F4%20%28band%29">F4</a> (called JVKV since 2007) blew up big as a result of the success of their TV drama <a href="Meteor%20Garden">Meteor Garden</a>. Their popularity spread throughout Asia. With their success, many other Taiwanese boy bands emerged around this time, such as <a href="5566">5566</a> and <a href="Fahrenheit%20%28Taiwanese%20band%29">Fahrenheit</a>. In South Korea, <a href="Shinhwa">Shinhwa</a> also spread <a href="hallyu">hallyu</a> wave throughout Asia such as <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="China">China</a>. Also in 2001, a new all-male pop band and dance group boyband hailing from Japan called <a href="Exile%20%28Japanese%20band%29">Exile</a> debuted under Avex Group's label <a href="Rhythm%20Zone">Rhythm Zone</a> with 14 members, putting them on par with <a href="Super%20Junior">Super Junior</a>, a South Korean boy band, who had 13 members at its peak.

Japanese boy band <a href="Arashi">Arashi</a> has sold over 30 million copies of their records since their first release in 1999. They had the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20in%20Japan%23Best-selling%20singles%20by%20year">yearly best-selling single in Japan</a> in 2008 and 2009. In 2003 <a href="SMAP">SMAP</a> released the single "<a href="Sekai%20ni%20Hitotsu%20Dake%20no%20Hana">Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana</a>" that has become the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20in%20Japan%23List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20in%20Japan%20%281968-present%29">fourth best-selling single ever in Japan</a>, with over 2.93 million copies sold.

In North America, the <a href="Jonas%20Brothers">Jonas Brothers</a> rose to fame from promotion on the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> in 2008. Other boy bands like <a href="JLS">JLS</a> and <a href="Mindless%20Behavior">Mindless Behavior</a> also emerged and experienced remarkable success around this time. However, apart from them, boy bands haven't seen the commercial boom experienced in the genre from the mid to late nineties in North America.

Moving into the 2010s, boy bands are still popular especially in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe due to the continued commercial presence and longevity of nineties boy bands such as <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a> (before they disbanded in 2012), and the successful comeback of <a href="Take%20That">Take That</a> in 2005, <a href="Boyzone">Boyzone</a> in 2007, and <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a> in 2008. Some sections of the press have referred to these acts, particularly those who have reformed after a previous split, such as Take That, Boyzone, and <a href="98%20Degrees">98 Degrees</a>, as 'man bands'. These older generation boy bands chart alongside the new boy bands.
In the early 2010s, there was somewhat of a resurgence of boy band popularity in countries where the trend had not maintained, with the emergence of new boy bands like <a href="Big%20Time%20Rush%20%28band%29">Big Time Rush</a>, <a href="The%20Wanted">The Wanted</a>, and <a href="One%20Direction">One Direction</a> and the formation of <a href="Supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> <a href="NKOTBSB">NKOTBSB</a> which comprised members of New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys. NKOTBSB's success inspired boy bands who were fairly popular during the 1990s and 2000s to make a comeback, such as A1, <a href="Blue%20%28English%20band%29">Blue</a>, 98 Degrees, <a href="Five%20%28band%29">Five</a>, <a href="911%20%28UK%20band%29">911</a>, and O-Town. Like <a href="2gether%20%28band%29">2gether</a> and <a href="The%20Monkees">The Monkees</a>, Big Time Rush was a manufactured act created for a television show.

In Southeast Asia, local boy bands also emerged as a result of the continued success of Korean and Japanese boy bands such as <a href="SMAP">SMAP</a>, <a href="Shinhwa">Shinhwa</a>, <a href="TVXQ%21">TVXQ!</a>, <a href="Arashi">Arashi</a>, <a href="Exile%20%28Japanese%20band%29">Exile</a>, <a href="Super%20Junior">Super Junior</a>, <a href="Big%20Bang%20%28South%20Korean%20band%29">Big Bang</a>, <a href="SHINee">SHINee</a>, and <a href="EXO%20%28band%29">EXO</a>. One of the boy bands who emerged as a result of <a href="Hallyu">Hallyu</a> (Korean wave) is Indonesia's <a href="SM%2ASH">SM*SH</a> who enjoyed prominent success domestically. In the Philippines, a major boy band has been formed by bringing the first reality boy band search of the country called <a href="Pinoy%20Boyband%20Superstar">Pinoy Boyband Superstar</a> which held mid <a href="Pinoy%20Boyband%20Superstar">2016</a>, after all the series of auditions, rigorous training and competition, the winners formed as a group called <a href="Boyband%20PH">Boyband PH</a> a five-piece Pinoy boy band which managed by <a href="Star%20Magic">Star Magic</a>

In South Korea, boy bands have been very successful. On the <a href="Gaon%20Music%20Chart">Gaon Music Chart</a> year-end albums chart of 2016, nine of the top 10 and 17 of the top 20 albums are by boy bands or by subunits/members of boy bands. <a href="BIGBANG">BIGBANG</a>,<a href="EXO%20%28band%29">EXO</a> had the second and third best-selling albums. Other boy bands with albums in the yearly top 20 of 2016 are <a href="BTS%20%28band%29">BTS</a>, <a href="SHINee">SHINee</a>, <a href="GOT7">GOT7</a>, <a href="Seventeen%20%28band%29">Seventeen</a>, <a href="Infinite%20%28band%29">INFINITE</a> and <a href="VIXX">VIXX</a>.

In Japan, <a href="Arashi">Arashi</a> continue to be very successful, being the <a href="2016%20in%20Japanese%20music%23Artists">best-selling music artist in Japan in 2016 by value of sales</a> and also having the yearly best-selling album in the country in 2015 and 2016. Other successful Japanese boy bands in this decade include <a href="Sandaime%20J%20Soul%20Brothers">Sandaime J Soul Brothers</a>, the second best-selling music artist of 2016 in the country and <a href="Kanjani%20Eight">Kanjani Eight</a>, the fifth best-selling music artist of that year in Japan.

Seen as important to a "boy band" group's commercial success is the group's <a href="Reputation">image</a>, carefully controlled by managing all aspects of the group's attire, promotional materials (which are frequently supplied to <a href="teen%20magazine">teen magazine</a>s), and music videos. The key factor of a boy band is being trendy. This means that the band conforms to the most recent fashion and musical trends in the popular music scene. Typically, each member of the group will have some distinguishing feature and be portrayed as having a particular personality stereotype, such as "the baby," "the bad boy," or "the shy one." While managing the portrayal of popular musicians is as old as <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a>, the particular pigeonholing of band members is a defining characteristic of boy and girl bands.

In most cases, their music is written, arranged and produced by a producer who works with the band at all times and controls the group's sound – if necessary, to the point of hiring <a href="session%20singers">session singers</a> to record guide vocals for each member of the group to sing individually if the members cannot harmonize well together. However, for clarity of each voice, recording each voice individually is most commonly the norm with most modern vocal groups. In recent years <a href="auto-tune">auto-tune</a> has become a popular tool for boy bands who are unable to sing to a high standard. Some boy bands have come under fire for this issue of using auto-tune. Some have also come under fire for <a href="lip%20syncing">lip syncing</a> in their performances as well, for example <a href="New%20Kids%20on%20the%20Block">New Kids on the Block</a>.

A typical boy band performance features elaborately choreographed dancing, with the members taking turns singing and/or rapping. Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like <a href="Gary%20Barlow">Gary Barlow</a> of <a href="Take%20That">Take That</a> or <a href="Tony%20Mortimer">Tony Mortimer</a> of <a href="East%2017">East 17</a>. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles.

Since the 21st century, however, boy bands have been expected to write or at least contribute in some part lyrically to songs. Apart from the groups mentioned above who all had at least one primary songwriter from their beginning, other groups soon caught up. From the late nineties, members of <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> who had previously used writers like <a href="Max%20Martin">Max Martin</a> during their early albums began writing their own songs. Newer groups from late 2000s such as <a href="JLS">JLS</a> have all made a point from early interviews that they write their own songs and hold their own image as this is an important part of marketing. Some bands like <a href="The%20Wanted">The Wanted</a> have even spent time learning the craft of songwriting.

Individuals can also go on to achieve greater success as a solo artist coming out of a boy band having used the groups popularity to build on. Usually this signals the end of the group until potential future reunions. Examples of this include <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> from <a href="The%20Jackson%205">The Jackson 5</a>, <a href="Donny%20Osmond">Donny Osmond</a> from <a href="The%20Osmonds">The Osmonds</a>, <a href="Ricky%20Martin">Ricky Martin</a> from <a href="Menudo%20%28band%29">Menudo</a>, <a href="Justin%20Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a> from *NSYNC, and <a href="Ronan%20Keating">Ronan Keating</a> from <a href="Boyzone">Boyzone</a>. Sometimes the most successful solo star from a band is not the most popular member such as <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a> as opposed to lead singer <a href="Gary%20Barlow">Gary Barlow</a> from <a href="Take%20That">Take That</a>. Some boy band members have gone on to successful careers elsewhere in the media. <a href="Michael%20Dolenz">Michael Dolenz</a> of <a href="The%20Monkees">The Monkees</a> went on to become a successful television producer, working for <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20channel%29">ITV</a> franchises such as <a href="LWT">LWT</a> and <a href="Television%20South">Television South</a>.

Although most boy bands consist of <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> or pop influences, other <a href="music%20genre">music genre</a>s, most notably <a href="country%20music">country music</a> and <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, are also represented. <a href="South%2065">South 65</a> and <a href="Marshall%20Dyllon">Marshall Dyllon</a>, for example, were both country music boy bands. <a href="Il%20Divo">Il Divo</a>, created by <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> in 2004, are a vocal group that performs <a href="operatic%20pop">operatic pop</a> in several (mainly Italian) languages. Since then operatic/classical boy bands have become quite popular and common, especially in the UK. Since 2001 there has been some crossover with <a href="power%20pop">power pop</a> and <a href="pop%20punk">pop punk</a> from bands that play live instruments. Just recently some boy bands decided to go back to their original doo-wop roots, most notably, <a href="The%20Overtones">The Overtones</a>.

Since the 2000s, groups such as <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href="LFO%20%28group%29">LFO</a> have disliked the term "boy band" and have preferred to be known as a "male vocal group". Being categorized among boy bands was also the main reason <a href="The%20Moffatts">The Moffatts</a> split up. Boy bands have been accused by the music press of emphasizing the appearance and marketing of the group above the quality of music, deliberately trying to appeal to a <a href="preadolescence">preteen</a> audience and for conforming to trends instead of being original. Such criticisms can become extremely scathing. Boy bands are often seen as being short lived, although some acts such as <a href="The%20Jackson%205">The Jackson 5</a>, <a href="Backstreet%20Boys">Backstreet Boys</a>, <a href="Hanson%20%28band%29">Hanson</a>, <a href="Human%20Nature%20%28band%29">Human Nature</a>, <a href="New%20Edition">New Edition</a>, <a href="SMAP">SMAP</a>, <a href="Shinhwa">Shinhwa</a> and <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a> (before they split up in 2012) have sustained lasting careers.

Despite negative critical reception, boy bands continue to be generally successful, with some notable ones managing to sell tens of millions of records, placing them among the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">world's best selling music artists</a>. The best-selling boy bands based on sales figures are:

B-tree

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, a B-tree is a self-balancing <a href="tree%20data%20structure">tree data structure</a> that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in <a href="logarithmic%20time">logarithmic time</a>. The B-tree is a generalization of a <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a> in that a node can have more than two children . Unlike <a href="self-balancing%20binary%20search%20tree">self-balancing binary search tree</a>s, the B-tree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. B-trees are a good example of a data structure for external memory. It is commonly used in <a href="database">database</a>s and <a href="filesystem">filesystem</a>s.

In B-trees, internal (<a href="Leaf%20node">non-leaf</a>) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre-defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split. Because a range of child nodes is permitted, B-trees do not need re-balancing as frequently as other self-balancing search trees, but may waste some space, since nodes are not entirely full. The lower and upper bounds on the number of child nodes are typically fixed for a particular implementation. For example, in a <a href="2-3%20tree">2-3 B-tree</a> (often simply referred to as a 2-3 tree), each internal node may have only 2 or 3 child nodes.

Each internal node of a B-tree contains a number of <a href="Unique%20key">keys</a>. The keys act as separation values which divide its <a href="subtree">subtree</a>s. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: "a" and "a". All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than "a", all values in the middle subtree will be between "a" and "a", and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than "a".

Usually, the number of keys is chosen to vary between formula_1 and formula_2, where formula_1 is the minimum number of keys, and formula_4 is the minimum <a href="Outdegree%23Indegree%20and%20outdegree">degree</a> or <a href="branching%20factor">branching factor</a> of the tree. In practice, the keys take up the most space in a node. The factor of 2 will guarantee that nodes can be split or combined. If an internal node has formula_2 keys, then adding a key to that node can be accomplished by splitting the hypothetical formula_6 key node into two formula_1 key nodes and moving the key that would have been in the middle to the parent node. Each split node has the required minimum number of keys. Similarly, if an internal node and its neighbor each have formula_1 keys, then a key may be deleted from the internal node by combining it with its neighbor. Deleting the key would make the internal node have formula_9 keys; joining the neighbor would add formula_1 keys plus one more key brought down from the neighbor's parent. The result is an entirely full node of formula_2 keys.

The number of branches (or child nodes) from a node will be one more than the number of keys stored in the node. In a 2-3 B-tree, the internal nodes will store either one key (with two child nodes) or two keys (with three child nodes). A B-tree is sometimes described with the parameters formula_12 — formula_13 or simply with the highest branching order, formula_13.

A B-tree is kept balanced by requiring that all leaf nodes be at the same depth. This depth will increase slowly as elements are added to the tree, but an increase in the overall depth is infrequent, and results in all leaf nodes being one more node farther away from the root.

B-trees have substantial advantages over alternative implementations when the time to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in <a href="secondary%20storage">secondary storage</a> such as <a href="hard%20drive">disk drives</a>. By maximizing the number of keys within each <a href="internal%20node">internal node</a>, the height of the tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each child node and the size of a full <a href="Block%20%28data%20storage%29">disk block</a> or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.

The term B-tree may refer to a specific design or it may refer to a general class of designs. In the narrow sense, a B-tree stores keys in its internal nodes but need not store those keys in the records at the leaves. The general class includes variations such as the <a href="B%2B%20tree">B+ tree</a> and the B tree.

<a href="Rudolf%20Bayer">Rudolf Bayer</a> and <a href="Edward%20M.%20McCreight">Ed McCreight</a> invented the B-tree while working at <a href="Boeing">Boeing Research Labs</a> in 1971 , but they did not explain what, if anything, the "B" stands for. <a href="Douglas%20Comer">Douglas Comer</a> explains:
The origin of "B-tree" has never been explained by the authors. As we shall see, "balanced," "broad," or "bushy" might apply. Others suggest that the "B" stands for Boeing. Because of his contributions, however, it seems appropriate to think of B-trees as "Bayer"-trees. 

<a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> speculates on the etymology of B-trees in his May, 1980 lecture on the topic "CS144C classroom lecture about disk storage and B-trees", suggesting the "B" may have originated from Boeing or from Bayer's name.

<a href="Edward%20M.%20McCreight">Ed McCreight</a> answered a question on B-tree's name in 2013: 
Bayer and I were in a lunchtime where we get to think [of] a name. And ... B is, you know ... We were working for Boeing at the time, we couldn't use the name without talking to lawyers. So, there is a B. [The B-tree] has to do with balance, another B. Bayer was the senior author, who [was] several years older than I am and had many more publications than I did. So there is another B. And so, at the lunch table we never did resolve whether there was one of those that made more sense than the rest. What really lives to say is: the more you think about what the B in B-trees means, the better you understand B-trees."

Usually, sorting and searching algorithms have been characterized by the number of comparison operations that must be performed using <a href="Big%20O%20notation">order notation</a>. A <a href="binary%20search">binary search</a> of a sorted table with records, for example, can be done in roughly comparisons. If the table had 1,000,000 records, then a specific record could be located with at most 20 comparisons: .

Large databases have historically been kept on disk drives. The time to read a record on a disk drive far exceeds the time needed to compare keys once the record is available. The time to read a record from a disk drive involves a <a href="seek%20time">seek time</a> and a rotational delay. The seek time may be 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track seek time is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading seek time is 8.5 milliseconds. For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.

Naively, then, the time to locate one record out of a million would take 20 disk reads times 10 milliseconds per disk read, which is 0.2 seconds.

The time won't be that bad because individual records are grouped together in a disk block. A disk block might be 16 kilobytes. If each record is 160 bytes, then 100 records could be stored in each block. The disk read time above was actually for an entire block. Once the disk head is in position, one or more disk blocks can be read with little delay. With 100 records per block, the last 6 or so comparisons don't need to do any disk reads—the comparisons are all within the last disk block read.

To speed the search further, the first 13 to 14 comparisons (which each required a disk access) must be sped up.

A significant improvement can be made with an <a href="Index%20%28database%29">index</a>. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a <a href="Index%20%28database%29%23Sparse%20index">sparse index</a>). This auxiliary index would be 1% of the size of the original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would have to search only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.

The trick of creating an auxiliary index can be repeated to make an auxiliary index to the auxiliary index. That would make an aux-aux index that would need only 100 entries and would fit in one disk block.

Instead of reading 14 disk blocks to find the desired record, we only need to read 3 blocks. Reading and searching the first (and only) block of the aux-aux index identifies the relevant block in aux-index. Reading and searching that aux-index block identifies the relevant block in the main database. Instead of 150 milliseconds, we need only 30 milliseconds to get the record.

The auxiliary indices have turned the search problem from a binary search requiring roughly disk reads to one requiring only disk reads where is the blocking factor (the number of entries per block: entries per block in our example; reads).

In practice, if the main database is being frequently searched, the aux-aux index and much of the aux index may reside in a <a href="page%20cache">disk cache</a>, so they would not incur a disk read.

If the database does not change, then compiling the index is simple to do, and the index need never be changed. If there are changes, then managing the database and its index becomes more complicated.

Deleting records from a database is relatively easy. The index can stay the same, and the record can just be marked as deleted. The database remains in sorted order. If there are a large number of deletions, then searching and storage become less efficient.

Insertions can be very slow in a sorted sequential file because room for the inserted record must be made. Inserting a record before the first record requires shifting all of the records down one. Such an operation is just too expensive to be practical. One solution is to leave some spaces. Instead of densely packing all the records in a block, the block can have some free space to allow for subsequent insertions. Those spaces would be marked as if they were "deleted" records.

Both insertions and deletions are fast as long as space is available on a block. If an insertion won't fit on the block, then some free space on some nearby block must be found and the auxiliary indices adjusted. The hope is that enough space is available nearby, such that a lot of blocks do not need to be reorganized. Alternatively, some out-of-sequence disk blocks may be used.

The B-tree uses all of the ideas described above. In particular, a B-tree:

In addition, a B-tree minimizes waste by making sure the interior nodes are at least half full. A B-tree can handle an arbitrary number of insertions and deletions.

The literature on B-trees is not uniform in its terminology .

, , and others define the order of B-tree as the minimum number of keys in a non-root node. points out that terminology is ambiguous because the maximum number of keys is not clear. An order 3 B-tree might hold a maximum of 6 keys or a maximum of 7 keys. avoids the problem by defining the order to be maximum number of children (which is one more than the maximum number of keys).

The term leaf is also inconsistent. considered the leaf level to be the lowest level of keys, but Knuth considered the leaf level to be one level below the lowest keys . There are many possible implementation choices. In some designs, the leaves may hold the entire data record; in other designs, the leaves may only hold pointers to the data record. Those choices are not fundamental to the idea of a B-tree.

There are also unfortunate choices like using the variable "k" to represent the number of children when "k" could be confused with the number of keys.

For simplicity, most authors assume there are a fixed number of keys that fit in a node. The basic assumption is the key size is fixed and the node size is fixed. In practice, variable length keys may be employed .

According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order "m" is a tree which satisfies the following properties:


Each internal node’s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: "a" and "a". All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than "a", all values in the middle subtree will be between "a" and "a", and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than "a".




A B-tree of depth "n"+1 can hold about "U" times as many items as a B-tree of depth "n", but the cost of search, insert, and delete operations grows with the depth of the tree. As with any balanced tree, the cost grows much more slowly than the number of elements.

Some balanced trees store values only at leaf nodes, and use different kinds of nodes for leaf nodes and internal nodes. B-trees keep values in every node in the tree, and may use the same structure for all nodes. However, since leaf nodes never have children, the B-trees benefit from improved performance if they use a specialized structure.

Let "h" be the height of the classic B-tree. Let "n" > 0 be the number of entries in the tree. Let "m" be the maximum number of children a node can have. Each node can have at most "m"−1 keys.

It can be shown (by induction for example) that a B-tree of height "h" with all its nodes completely filled has "n"= "m"−1 entries. Hence, the best case height of a B-tree is:

Let "d" be the minimum number of children an internal (non-root) node can have. For an ordinary B-tree, "d"=⌈"m"/2⌉.

Searching is similar to searching a binary search tree. Starting at the root, the tree is recursively traversed from top to bottom. At each level, the search reduces its field of view to the child pointer (subtree) whose range includes the search value. A subtree's range is defined by the values, or keys, contained in its parent node. These limiting values are also known as separation values.

Binary search is typically (but not necessarily) used within nodes to find the separation values and child tree of interest.

All insertions start at a leaf node. To insert a new element, search the tree to find the leaf node where the new element should be added. Insert the new element into that node with the following steps:


If the splitting goes all the way up to the root, it creates a new root with a single separator value and two children, which is why the lower bound on the size of internal nodes does not apply to the root. The maximum number of elements per node is "U"−1. When a node is split, one element moves to the parent, but one element is added. So, it must be possible to divide the maximum number "U"−1 of elements into two legal nodes. If this number is odd, then "U"=2"L" and one of the new nodes contains ("U"−2)/2 = "L"−1 elements, and hence is a legal node, and the other contains one more element, and hence it is legal too. If "U"−1 is even, then "U"=2"L"−1, so there are 2"L"−2 elements in the node. Half of this number is "L"−1, which is the minimum number of elements allowed per node.

An improved algorithm supports a single pass down the tree from the root to the node where the insertion will take place, splitting any full nodes encountered on the way. This prevents the need to recall the parent nodes into memory, which may be expensive if the nodes are on secondary storage. However, to use this improved algorithm, we must be able to send one element to the parent and split the remaining "U"−2 elements into two legal nodes, without adding a new element. This requires "U" = 2"L" rather than "U" = 2"L"−1, which accounts for why some textbooks impose this requirement in defining B-trees.

There are two popular strategies for deletion from a B-tree.


The algorithm below uses the former strategy.

There are two special cases to consider when deleting an element:


The procedures for these cases are in order below.


Each element in an internal node acts as a separation value for two subtrees, therefore we need to find a replacement for separation. Note that the largest element in the left subtree is still less than the separator. Likewise, the smallest element in the right subtree is still greater than the separator. Both of those elements are in leaf nodes, and either one can be the new separator for the two subtrees. Algorithmically described below:


Rebalancing starts from a leaf and proceeds toward the root until the tree is balanced. If deleting an element from a node has brought it under the minimum size, then some elements must be redistributed to bring all nodes up to the minimum. Usually, the redistribution involves moving an element from a sibling node that has more than the minimum number of nodes. That redistribution operation is called a rotation. If no sibling can spare an element, then the deficient node must be merged with a sibling. The merge causes the parent to lose a separator element, so the parent may become deficient and need rebalancing. The merging and rebalancing may continue all the way to the root. Since the minimum element count doesn't apply to the root, making the root be the only deficient node is not a problem. The algorithm to rebalance the tree is as follows:


While freshly loaded databases tend to have good sequential behavior, this behavior becomes increasingly difficult to maintain as a database grows, resulting in more random I/O and performance challenges.

In applications, it is frequently useful to build a B-tree to represent a large existing collection of data and then update it incrementally using standard B-tree operations. In this case, the most efficient way to construct the initial B-tree is not to insert every element in the initial collection successively, but instead to construct the initial set of leaf nodes directly from the input, then build the internal nodes from these. This approach to B-tree construction is called <a href="bulkloading">bulkloading</a>. Initially, every leaf but the last one has one extra element, which will be used to build the internal nodes.

For example, if the leaf nodes have maximum size 4 and the initial collection is the integers 1 through 24, we would initially construct 4 leaf nodes containing 5 values each and 1 which contains 4 values:

We build the next level up from the leaves by taking the last element from each leaf node except the last one. Again, each node except the last will contain one extra value. In the example, suppose the internal nodes contain at most 2 values (3 child pointers). Then the next level up of internal nodes would be:

This process is continued until we reach a level with only one node and it is not overfilled. In the example only the root level remains:

In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree (or ) is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block formula_17 address into a disk block (or perhaps to a <a href="cylinder-head-sector">cylinder-head-sector</a>) address.

Some operating systems require the user to allocate the maximum size of the file when the file is created. The file can then be allocated as contiguous disk blocks. In that case, to convert the file block address formula_17 into a disk block address, the operating system simply adds the file block address formula_17 to the address of the first disk block constituting the file. The scheme is simple, but the file cannot exceed its created size.

Other operating systems allow a file to grow. The resulting disk blocks may not be contiguous, so mapping logical blocks to physical blocks is more involved.

<a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, for example, used a simple <a href="File%20Allocation%20Table">File Allocation Table</a> (FAT). The FAT has an entry for each disk block, and that entry identifies whether its block is used by a file and if so, which block (if any) is the next disk block of the same file. So, the allocation of each file is represented as a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a> in the table. In order to find the disk address of file block formula_17, the operating system (or disk utility) must sequentially follow the file's linked list in the FAT. Worse, to find a free disk block, it must sequentially scan the FAT. For MS-DOS, that was not a huge penalty because the disks and files were small and the FAT had few entries and relatively short file chains. In the <a href="FAT12">FAT12</a> filesystem (used on floppy disks and early hard disks), there were no more than 4,080 entries, and the FAT would usually be resident in memory. As disks got bigger, the FAT architecture began to confront penalties. On a large disk using FAT, it may be necessary to perform disk reads to learn the disk location of a file block to be read or written.

<a href="TOPS-20">TOPS-20</a> (and possibly <a href="TOPS-20%23TENEX">TENEX</a>) used a 0 to 2 level tree that has similarities to a B-tree. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file fit in a 512 (2) word block, then the file directory would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 2 words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 2 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 2 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.

Apple's filesystem <a href="HFS%2B">HFS+</a>, Microsoft's <a href="NTFS">NTFS</a>, AIX (jfs2) and some <a href="Linux">Linux</a> filesystems, such as <a href="btrfs">btrfs</a> and <a href="Ext4">Ext4</a>, use B-trees.

B-trees are used in the <a href="Hierarchical%20File%20System">HFS</a> and <a href="Reiser4">Reiser4</a> <a href="file%20system">file system</a>s.

Lehman and Yao showed that all the read locks could be avoided (and thus concurrent access greatly improved) by linking the tree blocks at each level together with a "next" pointer. This results in a tree structure where both insertion and search operations descend from the root to the leaf. Write locks are only required as a tree block is modified. This maximizes access concurrency by multiple users, an important consideration for databases and/or other B-tree based <a href="ISAM">ISAM</a> storage methods. The cost associated with this improvement is that empty pages cannot be removed from the btree during normal operations. (However, see for various strategies to implement node merging, and source code at.)

United States Patent 5283894, granted in 1994, appears to show a way to use a 'Meta Access Method' to allow concurrent B+ tree access and modification without locks. The technique accesses the tree 'upwards' for both searches and updates by means of additional in-memory indexes that point at the blocks in each level in the block cache. No reorganization for deletes is needed and there are no 'next' pointers in each block as in Lehman and Yao.

British Museum

The British Museum, located in the <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> area of <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, is a public institution dedicated to <a href="human%20history">human history</a>, <a href="art">art</a> and <a href="culture">culture</a>. Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works, is among the <a href="list%20of%20largest%20art%20museums">largest</a> and most comprehensive in existence and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.

The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Sir Hans Sloane</a>. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759, in <a href="Montagu%20House%2C%20Bloomsbury">Montagu House</a>, on the site of the current building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">British Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a> in 1881 (it is nowadays simply called the Natural History Museum, and is separate and independent).

In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> in the same <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">Reading Room</a> and building as the museum until 1997. The museum is a <a href="non-departmental%20public%20body">non-departmental public body</a> sponsored by the <a href="Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport">Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a>, and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.

Although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and <a href="Ancient%20history">antiquities</a>, the British Museum was founded as a "universal museum". Its foundations lie in the will of the Irish-born British physician and naturalist <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Sir Hans Sloane</a> (1660–1753). During the course of his lifetime Sloane gathered an enviable <a href="cabinet%20of%20curiosities">collection of curiosities</a> and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II</a>, for the nation, for a sum of £20,000.

At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, <a href="Old%20master%20print">prints</a> and drawings including those by <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> and antiquities from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">Sudan</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near</a> and <a href="East%20Asia">Far East</a> and the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Americas">Americas</a>.

On 7 June 1753, King George II gave his formal assent to the <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> which established the British Museum. The <a href="British%20Museum%20Act%201753">British Museum Act 1753</a> also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection, namely the <a href="Cotton%20library">Cottonian Library</a>, assembled by <a href="Robert%20Bruce%20Cotton">Sir Robert Cotton</a>, dated back to <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> times and the <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Mortimer">Harleian library</a>, the collection of the <a href="Earl%20of%20Oxford">Earls of Oxford</a>. They were joined in 1757 by the "Old Royal Library", now the <a href="Royal%20manuscripts%2C%20British%20Library">Royal manuscripts</a>, assembled by various <a href="British%20monarchy">British monarchs</a>. Together these four "foundation collections" included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library including the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> and the sole surviving manuscript of "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>".

The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests. The addition of the <a href="Robert%20Bruce%20Cotton">Cotton</a> and <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Mortimer">Harley manuscripts</a> introduced a literary and <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> element and meant that the British Museum now became both <a href="National%20Museum">National Museum</a> and <a href="library">library</a>.

The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, <a href="Montagu%20House%2C%20Bloomsbury">Montagu House</a>, as a location for the museum, which it bought from the <a href="Ralph%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Montagu">Montagu family</a> for £20,000. The Trustees rejected Buckingham House, on the site now occupied by <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.

With the acquisition of Montagu House the first exhibition galleries and <a href="Library">reading room</a> for scholars opened on 15 January 1759. In 1823, King George IV gave the <a href="King%27s%20Library">King's Library</a> assembled by George III, and Parliament gave the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the <a href="Thomason%20Collection%20of%20Civil%20War%20Tracts">Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts</a> and <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>'s library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the Museum acquired for £8,410 its first significant antiquities in <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">Sir William Hamilton</a>'s "first" collection of <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek vases</a>.

From 1778, a display of objects from the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">South Sea</a>s brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, <a href="engraved%20gem">engraved gem</a>s, coins, prints and drawings by <a href="Clayton%20Mordaunt%20Cracherode">Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode</a> in 1800 did much to raise the Museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.

The museum's first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">William Hamilton</a> (1730–1803), British Ambassador to <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the Museum, dated 31 January 1784, refers to the Hamilton bequest of a "Colossal Foot of an <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> in Marble". It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in London.

In the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the <a href="Campaigns%20of%201799%20in%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French campaign</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> presented the <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs. Gifts and purchases from <a href="Henry%20Salt%20%28Egyptologist%29">Henry Salt</a>, British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the <a href="Younger%20Memnon">Colossal bust of Ramesses II</a> in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture. Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the <a href="Charles%20Towneley">Charles Towneley collection</a>, much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, <a href="Thomas%20Bruce%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin</a>, ambassador to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, on the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a> in Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter. The collections were supplemented by the <a href="Bassae">Bassae</a> frieze from <a href="Phigalia">Phigaleia</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a> in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n antiquities from the widow of <a href="Claudius%20James%20Rich">Claudius James Rich</a>.

In 1802 a Buildings Committee was set-up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the <a href="King%27s%20Library">King's Library</a>, personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s, maps, charts and <a href="Topographic%20map">topographical drawings</a>. The <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> architect, <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Sir Robert Smirke</a>, was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the Museum "... for the reception of the <a href="Royal%20Library%2C%20Windsor">Royal Library</a>, and a Picture Gallery over it ..." and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old <a href="Montagu%20House%2C%20Bloomsbury">Montagu House</a> was demolished and work on the <a href="King%27s%20Library">King's Library</a> Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the <a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery, London</a> in 1824, the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the <a href="Natural%20history">Natural history</a> collections.

The Museum became a construction site as <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Sir Robert Smirke</a>'s grand <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neo-classical</a> building gradually arose. The <a href="King%27s%20Library">King's Library</a>, on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London. Although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, special openings were arranged during <a href="The%20Great%20Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a> of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.

In 1840, the Museum became involved in its first overseas <a href="excavation%20%28archeology%29">excavation</a>s, <a href="Charles%20Fellows">Charles Fellows</a>'s expedition to <a href="Xanthos">Xanthos</a>, in <a href="Anatolia">Asia Minor</a>, whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>, among them the <a href="Nereid%20Monument">Nereid</a> and <a href="Tomb%20of%20Payava">Payava</a> monuments. In 1857, <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Newton">Charles Newton</a> was to discover the 4th-century BC <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Maussollos">Mausoleum of Halikarnassos</a>, one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>. In the 1840s and 1850s the Museum supported excavations in <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> by <a href="Austen%20Henry%20Layard">A.H. Layard</a> and others at sites such as <a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a> and <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a>'s great library of <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> <a href="Clay%20tablet">tablets</a>, which helped to make the Museum a focus for <a href="Assyriology">Assyrian studies</a>.

<a href="Thomas%20Grenville">Sir Thomas Grenville</a> (1755–1846), a Trustee of The British Museum from 1830, assembled a library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the Museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a> in 1998.

The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Robert Smirke</a>'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n sculptures and <a href="Sydney%20Smirke">Sydney Smirke</a>'s <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">Round Reading Room</a>, with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, which would later become the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">British Museum of Natural History</a>.

Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the "second founder" of the British Museum, the Italian librarian <a href="Anthony%20Panizzi">Anthony Panizzi</a>. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now part of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Paris">National Library of Paris</a>. The <a href="Quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a> at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.

Until the mid-19th century, the Museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of <a href="Augustus%20Wollaston%20Franks">Augustus Wollaston Franks</a> to curate the collections, the Museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a>, branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of <a href="ethnography">ethnography</a>. A real coup for the museum was the purchase in 1867, over French objections, of the <a href="Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Blacas">Duke of Blacas</a>'s wide-ranging and valuable collection of antiquities. Overseas excavations continued and <a href="John%20Turtle%20Wood">John Turtle Wood</a> discovered the remains of the 4th century BC <a href="Temple%20of%20Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> at <a href="Ephesus">Ephesos</a>, another <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Wonder of the Ancient World</a>.

The natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History in 1887, nowadays the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and <a href="ethnography">ethnography</a> and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.

The <a href="William%20Burges">William Burges</a> collection of <a href="armoury">armoury</a> was bequeathed to the museum in 1881. In 1882, the Museum was involved in the establishment of the independent <a href="Egypt%20Exploration%20Fund">Egypt Exploration Fund</a> (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, <a href="Augustus%20Wollaston%20Franks">A.W. Franks</a>, was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 <a href="Ring%20%28finger%29">finger rings</a>, 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 <a href="netsuke">netsuke</a>, 850 <a href="inro">inro</a>, over 30,000 <a href="bookplates">bookplates</a> and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the <a href="Oxus%20Treasure">Oxus Treasure</a>.

In 1898 <a href="Ferdinand%20James%20von%20Rothschild">Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> bequeathed the <a href="Waddesdon%20Bequest">Waddesdon Bequest</a>, the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of "<a href="objets%20d%27art">objets d'art</a> et de vertu" which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and <a href="maiolica">maiolica</a>, among them the <a href="Holy%20Thorn%20Reliquary">Holy Thorn Reliquary</a>, probably created in the 1390s in Paris for <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a>. The collection was in the tradition of a <a href="schatzkammer">schatzkammer</a> or treasure house such as those formed by the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> princes of Europe. Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should be

By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased so much that the Museum building was no longer big enough for them. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the Museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the West, North and East sides of the Museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.

All the while, the collections kept growing. <a href="Emil%20Torday">Emil Torday</a> collected in Central Africa, <a href="Marc%20Aurel%20Stein">Aurel Stein</a> in Central Asia, <a href="David%20George%20Hogarth">D.G. Hogarth</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Woolley">Leonard Woolley</a> and <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a> excavated at <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a>. Around this time, the American collector and philanthropist <a href="J%20Pierpont%20Morgan">J Pierpont Morgan</a> donated a substantial number of objects to the museum, including <a href="William%20Greenwell">William Greenwell</a>'s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across Europe which he had purchased for £10,000 in 1908. Morgan had also acquired a major part of Sir <a href="John%20Evans%20%28archaeologist%29">John Evans</a>'s coin collection, which was later sold to the museum by his son <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan%2C%20Jr.">John Pierpont Morgan Junior</a> in 1915. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Wales">National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)</a> and a country house near <a href="Malvern%2C%20Worcestershire">Malvern</a>. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A temporary conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence. In 1923, the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.

New <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a> floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931, the art dealer <a href="Joseph%20Duveen%2C%201st%20Baron%20Duveen%20of%20Millbank">Sir Joseph Duveen</a> offered funds to build a gallery for the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Parthenon sculptures</a>. Designed by the American architect <a href="John%20Russell%20Pope">John Russell Pope</a>, it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades. However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids the Parthenon Sculptures along with Museum's most valued collections were dispersed to secure basements, <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a>, <a href="Aldwych%20tube%20station">Aldwych tube station</a>, the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Wales">National Library of Wales</a> and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing. Meanwhile, prior to the war, the Nazis had sent a researcher to the British Museum for several years with the aim of "compiling an anti-Semitic history of Anglo-Jewry." After the war, the Museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n treasure from <a href="Ur">Ur</a>, discovered during <a href="Leonard%20Woolley">Leonard Woolley</a>'s 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and <a href="garnet">garnet</a> grave goods from the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> ship burial at <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from <a href="Mildenhall%20Treasure">Mildenhall</a>, Suffolk (1946). The immediate <a href="post-war">post-war</a> years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the <a href="The%20Blitz">Blitz</a>. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.

In 1953, the Museum celebrated its <a href="200%20%28number%29">bicentenary</a>. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A <a href="The%20British%20Museum%20Friends">Friends</a> organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963, a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees">Board of Trustees</a> changed and the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> became fully independent. By 1959 the <a href="British%20Museum%20Department%20of%20Coins%20and%20Medals">Coins and Medals</a> office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Robert Smirke's</a> Classical and Near Eastern galleries. In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.

By the 1970s the Museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition "Treasures of <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>" in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of <a href="manuscripts">manuscripts</a> and printed books from the British Museum. This left the Museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints & drawings; and <a href="ethnography">ethnography</a>. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1 miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a> for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.

The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Robert Smirke's</a> 19th-century central quadrangle into the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20Great%20Court">Queen Elizabeth II Great Court</a> – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000. The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived <a href="Museum%20of%20Mankind">Museum of Mankind</a> at <a href="6%20Burlington%20Gardens">6 Burlington Gardens</a> from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries in the museum in 2000.

The Museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in "modern" objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and there were excavations in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>, Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The <a href="Weston%20family">Weston</a> Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered <a href="hoard">hoard</a>s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The Museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.

Today the museum no longer houses collections of <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>, and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> and 150 million at the British Library.

The <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">Round Reading Room</a>, which was designed by the architect <a href="Sydney%20Smirke">Sydney Smirke</a>, opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a>. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore <a href="Annenberg%20Foundation">Annenberg</a> Centre.

With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the process of demolition for <a href="Lord%20Foster">Lord Foster</a>'s glass-roofed <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%20Great%20Court">Great Court</a> could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the <a href="David%20Sainsbury%2C%20Baron%20Sainsbury%20of%20Turville">Sainsbury</a> family – with the donation valued at £25 million.

As part of its very large website, the museum has the largest <a href="online%20database">online database</a> of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012. There is also a "Highlights" database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access). In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.

In 2013 the museum received a record 6.7 million visitors, an increase of 20% from the previous year. Popular exhibitions including "Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum" and "Ice Age Art" are credited with helping fuel the increase in visitors. Plans were announced in September 2014 to recreate the entire building along with all exhibits in the video game "<a href="Minecraft">Minecraft</a>" in conjunction with members of the public.

The British Museum is a <a href="non-departmental%20public%20body">non-departmental public body</a> sponsored by the <a href="Department%20for%20Culture%2C%20Media%20and%20Sport">Department for Culture, Media and Sport</a> through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20British%20Museum">Director</a>. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'Principal Librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the Museum), a role that was renamed 'Director and Principal Librarian' in 1898, and 'Director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).

A board of <a href="List%20of%20trustees%20of%20the%20British%20Museum">25 trustees</a> (with the Director as their <a href="Chief%20accounting%20officer">accounting officer</a> for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the Museum, in accordance with the <a href="British%20Museum%20Act">British Museum Act</a> 1963 and the <a href="Museums%20and%20Galleries%20Act%201992">Museums and Galleries Act 1992</a>. Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> and the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20British%20House%20of%20Commons">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>. The board was formed on the Museum's inception to <a href="trust%20law">hold its collections in trust</a> for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. <a href="Trustee">Trustee</a> appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

The <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Robert Smirke</a>, with 44 columns in the <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic order</a> high, closely based on those of the temple of <a href="Athena">Athena Polias</a> at <a href="Priene">Priene</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. The <a href="pediment">pediment</a> over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir <a href="Richard%20Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a> depicting "The Progress of Civilisation", consisting of fifteen <a href="Allegory">allegorical</a> figures, installed in 1852.

The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing (<a href="King%27s%20Library">The King's Library</a>) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with <a href="Montagu%20House%2C%20Bloomsbury">Montagu House</a> demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public. The Museum is faced with <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using <a href="Haytor">Haytor</a> granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique <a href="Haytor%20Granite%20Tramway">Haytor Granite Tramway</a>.

In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the Museum's architect by his brother <a href="Sydney%20Smirke">Sydney Smirke</a>, whose major addition was the <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">Round Reading Room</a> 1854–1857; at in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a> in Rome being slightly wider.

The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir <a href="John%20Taylor%20%28architect%29">John Taylor</a>.

In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street. The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir <a href="John%20James%20Burnet">John James Burnet</a> was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.

The <a href="Joseph%20Duveen%2C%201st%20Baron%20Duveen%20of%20Millbank">Duveen</a> Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek & Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts</a> architect <a href="John%20Russell%20Pope">John Russell Pope</a>. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.

The <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> Great Court is a covered square at the centre of the British Museum designed by the engineers <a href="Buro%20Happold">Buro Happold</a> and the architects <a href="Foster%20and%20Partners">Foster and Partners</a>. The Great Court opened in December 2000 and is the largest covered square in Europe. The roof is a glass and steel construction, built by an Austrian steelwork company, with 1,656 uniquely shaped panes of glass. At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.

Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000 m (990,000 sq. ft). In addition to 21,600 m (232,000 sq. ft) of on-site storage space, and 9,400 m (101,000 sq. ft) of external storage space. Altogether the British Museum showcases on public display less than 1% of its entire collection, approximately 50,000 items. There are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public, representing of exhibition space, although the less popular ones have restricted opening times. However, the lack of a large temporary exhibition space has led to the £135 million World Conservation and Exhibition Centre to provide one and to concentrate all the Museum's conservation facilities into one Conservation Centre. This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects <a href="Richard%20Rogers">Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners</a>. It was granted planning permission in December 2009 and was completed in time for the Viking exhibition in March 2014.

<a href="Blythe%20House">Blythe House</a> in West Kensington is used by the Museum for off-site storage of small and medium-sized artefacts, and Franks House in East London is used for storage and work on the "Early Prehistory" – <a href="Palaeolithic">Palaeolithic</a> and <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> – and some other collections.

The British Museum houses the world's largest and most comprehensive collection of <a href="Art%20of%20Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian antiquities</a> (with over 100,000 pieces) outside the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum</a> in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> and the <a href="History%20of%20Sudan">Sudan</a>. Together, they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the <a href="Nile">Nile Valley</a> (including <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>), from the <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic</a> <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period (c. 10,000 <a href="Anno%20Domini">BC</a>) through to the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic (Christian)</a> times (12th century <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a>), a time-span over 11,000 years.

<a href="Art%20of%20Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian antiquities</a> have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects from Sir <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Hans Sloane</a>. After the defeat of the forces under <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a> in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the <a href="British%20army">British army</a> and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed <a href="Henry%20Salt%20%28Egyptologist%29">Henry Salt</a> as <a href="Consul%20general">consul</a> in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Belzoni">Giovanni Belzoni</a>. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a>.

By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the museum in the latter part of the 19th century as a result of the work of the <a href="Egypt%20Exploration%20Society">Egypt Exploration Fund</a> under the efforts of <a href="E.%20A.%20Wallis%20Budge">E.A. Wallis Budge</a>. Over the years more than 11,000 objects came from this source, including pieces from <a href="Amarna">Amarna</a>, <a href="Bubastis">Bubastis</a> and <a href="Deir%20el-Bahari">Deir el-Bahari</a>. Other organisations and individuals also excavated and donated objects to the British Museum, including <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a>'s Egypt Research Account and the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, as well as the <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> Expedition to <a href="Kawa%20%28Sudan%29">Kawa</a> and <a href="Faras">Faras</a> in Sudan.
Active support by the museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in important acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported, although divisions still continue in Sudan. The British Museum conducted its own excavations in Egypt where it received divisions of finds, including <a href="Asyut">Asyut</a> (1907), <a href="El-Badari">Mostagedda</a> and <a href="El-Badari">Matmar</a> (1920s), <a href="Ashmunein">Ashmunein</a> (1980s) and sites in Sudan such as <a href="Soba%20%28city%29">Soba</a>, Kawa and the Northern Dongola Reach (1990s). The size of the Egyptian collections now stand at over 110,000 objects.

In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Sudan">Sudanese</a> <a href="Prehistory">Prehistory</a>. These were donated by Professor <a href="Fred%20Wendorf">Fred Wendorf</a> of <a href="Southern%20Methodist%20University">Southern Methodist University</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations at Prehistoric sites in the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara Desert</a> between 1963 and 1997. Other fieldwork collections have recently come from Dietrich and Rosemarie Klemm (<a href="University%20of%20Munich">University of Munich</a>) and William Adams (<a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>).

The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the museum's collection of 140 <a href="Mummy">mummies</a> and coffins, the largest outside <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Cairo</a>. A high proportion of the collection comes from tombs or contexts associated with the cult of the dead, and it is these pieces, in particular the mummies, that remain among the most eagerly sought after exhibits by visitors to the museum.

Key highlights of the collections include:

Predynastic and Early Dynastic period (c. 6000 BC – c. 2690 BC)

Old Kingdom (2690–2181 BC)

Middle Kingdom (2134–1690 BC)

New Kingdom (1549–1069 BC)

Third Intermediate Period (1069–664 BC)

Late Period (664–332 BC)

Ptolemaic dynasty (305–30 BC)

Roman Period (30 BC-641 AD)

The British Museum has one of the world's largest and most comprehensive collections of antiquities from the <a href="Classical%20antiquity">Classical world</a>, with over 100,000 objects. These mostly range in date from the beginning of the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Greek Bronze Age</a> (about 3200 BC) to the establishment of Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, with the <a href="Edict%20of%20Milan">Edict of Milan</a> under the reign of the <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> in 313 AD. Archaeology was in its infancy during the nineteenth century and many pioneering individuals began excavating sites across the Classical world, chief among them for the museum were <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Newton">Charles Newton</a>, <a href="John%20Turtle%20Wood">John Turtle Wood</a>, <a href="Robert%20Murdoch%20Smith">Robert Murdoch Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Fellows">Charles Fellows</a>.

The Greek objects originate from across the Ancient Greek world, from the mainland of Greece and the Aegean Islands, to neighbouring lands in Asia Minor and Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean and as far as the western lands of <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> that include Sicily and southern Italy. The <a href="Cyclades">Cycladic</a>, <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> and <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> cultures are represented, and the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> collection includes important sculpture from the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> in Athens, as well as elements of two of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>, the <a href="Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</a> and the <a href="Temple%20of%20Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> at <a href="Ephesus">Ephesos</a>.

Beginning from the early <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the department also houses one of the widest-ranging collections of <a href="Ancient%20Italic%20peoples">Italic</a> and <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> antiquities outside Italy, as well as extensive groups of material from <a href="Ancient%20history%20of%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and non-Greek colonies in <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a> and <a href="Caria">Caria</a> on Asia Minor. There is some material from the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, but the collection's strength is in its comprehensive array of objects from across the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, with the exception of Britain (which is the mainstay of the Department of Prehistory and Europe).

The collections of ancient jewellery and bronzes, <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek vases</a> (many from graves in southern Italy that were once part of <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">Sir William Hamilton</a>'s and <a href="Edm%C3%A9-Antoine%20Durand">Chevalier Durand</a>'s collections), <a href="Glass">Roman glass</a> including the famous <a href="Cameo%20glass">Cameo glass</a> Portland Vase, <a href="Roman%20mosaic">Roman mosaic</a>s from <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> and <a href="Utica%2C%20Tunisia">Utica</a> in North Africa that were excavated by <a href="Nathan%20Davis%20%28traveller%29">Nathan Davis</a>, and silver hoards from <a href="Roman%20Gaul">Roman Gaul</a> (some of which were bequeathed by the philanthropist and museum trustee <a href="Richard%20Payne%20Knight">Richard Payne Knight</a>), are particularly important. Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir <a href="Robert%20Hamilton%20Lang">Robert Hamilton Lang</a>'s collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the <a href="Charles%20Townley%23Townley%20Collection">Townley collection</a> as well as residual sculptures from the famous <a href="Farnese%20collection">Farnese collection</a>.

Objects from the Department of Greece and Rome are located throughout the museum, although many of the <a href="architectural">architectural</a> monuments are to be found on the ground floor, with connecting galleries from Gallery 5 to Gallery 23. On the upper floor, there are galleries devoted to smaller material from ancient Italy, Greece, Cyprus and the Roman Empire.

Key highlights of the collections include:

<a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>

<a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheion</a>

Temple of <a href="Athena%20Nike">Athena Nike</a>

Temple of <a href="Bassae">Bassae</a>

With a collection numbering some 330,000 works, the British Museum possesses the world's largest and most important collection of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n antiquities outside <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of <a href="Assyrian%20sculpture">Assyrian sculpture</a>, <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n and <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster <a href="Assyrian%20palace%20reliefs">Assyrian palace reliefs</a> from <a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a>, <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> and <a href="Khorsabad">Khorsabad</a>.

The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These cover <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Iran">Persia</a>, the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, parts of Central Asia, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> and <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n settlements in the western <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> from the <a href="Prehistory">prehistoric period</a> and include objects from the beginning of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> in the 7th century.

The first significant addition of <a href="Mesopotamian">Mesopotamian</a> objects was from the collection of <a href="Claudius%20James%20Rich">Claudius James Rich</a> in 1825. The collection was later dramatically enlarged by the excavations of <a href="Austen%20Henry%20Layard">A. H. Layard</a> at the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n sites of <a href="Nimrud">Nimrud</a> and <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> between 1845 and 1851. At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of <a href="Ashurnasirpal%20II">Ashurnasirpal II</a>, as well as three other palaces and various temples. He later uncovered the Palace of <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result, a large numbers of <a href="Lamassu">Lamassu</a>'s, palace reliefs, <a href="Stele">stelae</a>, including the <a href="Black%20Obelisk%20of%20Shalmaneser%20III">Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III</a>, were brought to the British Museum.

Layard's work was continued by his assistant, <a href="Hormuzd%20Rassam">Hormuzd Rassam</a> and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous "<a href="Lion%20Hunt%20of%20Ashurbanipal">Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal</a>" and <a href="Lachish%20relief">Lachish relief</a>s. He also discovered the <a href="Library%20of%20Ashurbanipal">Royal Library of Ashurbanipal</a>, a large collection of <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> <a href="Clay%20tablet">tablets</a> of enormous importance that today number around 130,000 pieces. <a href="William%20Loftus">W. K. Loftus</a> excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of <a href="Nimrud%20ivories">ivories</a> in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the <a href="Cyrus%20Cylinder">Cyrus Cylinder</a> from <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, the bronze gates from <a href="Balawat">Balawat</a>, important objects from <a href="Sippar">Sippar</a>, and a fine collection of <a href="Urartu">Urartian</a> bronzes from <a href="Toprakkale">Toprakkale</a>.

In the early 20th century excavations were carried out at <a href="Carchemish">Carchemish</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> by <a href="David%20George%20Hogarth">D. G. Hogarth</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Woolley">Leonard Woolley</a>, the latter assisted by <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a>. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. From <a href="Ubaid%20period">Tell al-Ubaid</a> came the bronze furnishings of a <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud found by <a href="Henry%20Hall%20%28Egyptologist%29">H. R. Hall</a> in 1919–24. Woolley went onto to excavate <a href="Ur">Ur</a> between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '<a href="Standard%20of%20Ur">Standard of Ur</a>', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '<a href="Royal%20Game%20of%20Ur">Royal Game of Ur</a>', and two bull-headed <a href="lyres">lyres</a>. The department also has three <a href="diorite">diorite</a> statues of the ruler <a href="Statues%20of%20Gudea">Gudea</a> from the ancient state of <a href="Lagash">Lagash</a> and a series of limestone <a href="kudurru">kudurru</a> or boundary stones from different locations across ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.

Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia, most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The <a href="Achaemenid">Achaemenid</a> collection was enhanced with the addition of the <a href="Oxus%20Treasure">Oxus Treasure</a> in 1897 and objects excavated by the German scholar <a href="Ernst%20Herzfeld">Ernst Herzfeld</a> and the Hungarian-British explorer <a href="Marc%20Aurel%20Stein">Sir Aurel Stein</a>. Reliefs and sculptures from the site of <a href="Persepolis">Persepolis</a> were donated by Sir <a href="Gore%20Ouseley">Gore Ouseley</a> in 1825 and the <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">5th Earl of Aberdeen</a> in 1861. Moreover, the museum has been able to acquire one of the greatest assemblages of Achaemenid <a href="Household%20silver">silverware</a> in the world. The later <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a> is also well represented by ornate silver plates and cups, many representing ruling monarchs hunting lions and deer. Phoenician antiquities come from across the region, but the <a href="Tharros">Tharros</a> collection from <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and the large number of Phoenician stelae from <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> are outstanding. Another often overlooked highlight is <a href="Ancient%20history%20of%20Yemen">Yemeni</a> antiquities, the finest collection outside that country. Furthermore, the museum has a representative collection of <a href="Dilmun">Dilmun</a> and <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian</a> material excavated from various burial mounds at the ancient sites of <a href="A%27ali">A'ali</a> and <a href="Shakhura">Shakhura</a> in Bahrain.

From the modern state of <a href="Syria">Syria</a> come almost forty funerary busts from <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a> and a group of stone <a href="reliefs">reliefs</a> from the excavations of <a href="Max%20von%20Oppenheim">Max von Oppenheim</a> at <a href="Tell%20Halaf">Tell Halaf</a> that was purchased in 1920. More material followed from the excavations of <a href="Max%20Mallowan">Max Mallowan</a> at <a href="Chagar%20Bazar">Chagar Bazar</a> and <a href="Tell%20Brak">Tell Brak</a> in 1935–1938 and from Woolley at <a href="Alalakh">Alalakh</a> in the years just before and after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Mallowan returned with his wife <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a> to carry out further digs at Nimrud in the postwar period which secured many <a href="Nimrud%20Ivories">important artefacts</a> for the museum. The collection of <a href="Palestinian%20people">Palestinian</a> material was strengthened by the work of <a href="Kathleen%20Kenyon">Kathleen Kenyon</a> at <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a> in the 1950s and the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at <a href="Lachish">Lachish</a> by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938. Archaeological digs are still taking place where permitted in the Middle East, and, depending on the country, the museum continues to receive a share of the finds from sites such as in Jordan.

The museum's collection of <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a>, including archaeological material, numbers about 40,000 objects, one of the largest of its kind in the world. As such, it contains a broad range of pottery, paintings, tiles, metalwork, glass, seals, and inscriptions from across the Islamic world, from <a href="Spain">Spain</a> in the west to <a href="India">India</a> in the east. It is particularly famous for its collection of <a href="%C4%B0znik%20pottery">Iznik</a> ceramics (the largest in the world), a highlight of which is the mosque lamp from the <a href="Dome%20of%20the%20Rock">Dome of the Rock</a>, mediaeval metalwork such as the Vaso Vescovali with its depictions of the <a href="Zodiac">Zodiac</a>, a fine selection of <a href="astrolabes">astrolabes</a>, and <a href="Mughal%20paintings">Mughal paintings</a> and precious artwork including a large <a href="Jade%20Terrapin%20from%20Allahabad">jade terrapin</a> made for the Emperor <a href="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>. Thousands of objects were excavated after the war by professional archaeologists at Iranian sites such as <a href="Siraf">Siraf</a> by <a href="David%20Whitehouse">David Whitehouse</a> and <a href="Alamut%20Castle">Alamut Castle</a> by Peter Willey. The collection was augmented in 1983 by the <a href="Frederick%20DuCane%20Godman">Godman</a> bequest of Iznik, <a href="Hispano-Moresque">Hispano-Moresque</a> and early Iranian pottery. Artefacts from the Islamic world are on display in Gallery 34 of the museum.

A representative selection from the Department of Middle East, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries throughout the museum and total some 4,500 objects. A whole suite of rooms on the ground floor display the sculptured reliefs from the Assyrian palaces at Nineveh, Nimrud and Khorsabad, while 8 galleries on the upper floor hold smaller material from ancient sites across the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 <a href="Cuneiform%20script">cuneiform</a> <a href="Clay%20tablet">tablets</a> from Mesopotamia.

Key highlights of the collections include:

The Department of <a href="Old%20master%20print">Prints</a> and Drawings holds the national collection of <a href="Western%20art%20history">Western</a> prints and drawings. It ranks as one of the largest and best <a href="print%20room">print room</a> collections in existence alongside the <a href="Albertina%2C%20Vienna">Albertina</a> in Vienna, the Paris collections and the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage</a>. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections. The department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.

Since its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints. The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the <a href="Western%20art%20history">European schools</a>. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century.

There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Bewick">Thomas Bewick</a>.. The great eleven volume <a href="Catalogue%20of%20Political%20and%20Personal%20Satires%20Preserved%20in%20the%20Department%20of%20Prints%20and%20Drawings%20in%20the%20British%20Museum">Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum</a> compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high quality images. A 2011 donation of £1 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>'s "<a href="Vollard%20Suite">Vollard Suite</a>".

The Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory was established in 1969 and is responsible for collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as <a href="Prehistoric">Prehistoric</a> and neolithic objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. Archeological excavation of prehistoric material took off and expanded considerably in the twentieth century and the department now has literally millions of objects from the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> and <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> periods throughout the world, as well as from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and <a href="Iron%20age">Iron age</a> in Europe. Stone Age material from Africa has been donated by famous archaeologists such as <a href="Louis%20Leakey">Louis</a> and <a href="Mary%20Leakey">Mary Leakey</a>, and <a href="Gertrude%20Caton%E2%80%93Thompson">Gertrude Caton–Thompson</a>. Paleolithic objects from the <a href="William%20Allen%20Sturge">Sturge</a>, <a href="Henry%20Christy">Christy</a> and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Lartet">Lartet</a> collections include some of the earliest works of art from Europe. Many Bronze Age objects from across Europe were added during the nineteenth century, often from large collections built up by excavators and scholars such as <a href="William%20Greenwell">Greenwell</a> in Britain, <a href="Thomas%20Tobin">Tobin</a> and Cooke in Ireland, <a href="William%20Collings%20Lukis">Lukis</a> and de la Grancière in Brittany, <a href="Jens%20Jacob%20Asmussen%20Worsaae">Worsaae</a> in Denmark, <a href="Luis%20Siret">Siret</a> at <a href="El%20Argar">El Argar</a> in Spain, and <a href="Gustav%20Klemm">Klemm</a> and Edelmann in Germany. A representative selection of Iron Age artefacts from <a href="Hallstatt">Hallstatt</a> were acquired as a result of the <a href="Sir%20John%20Evans">Evans</a>/<a href="Sir%20John%20Lubbock">Lubbock</a> excavations and from <a href="Giubiasco">Giubiasco</a> in <a href="Ticino">Ticino</a> through the <a href="Swiss%20National%20Museum">Swiss National Museum</a>.

In addition, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and from North Africa to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>; a representative selection of these has recently been redisplayed in a newly refurbished gallery. Important collections include <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>n, <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a>, <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>ic and <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> material from <a href="Johann%20Karl%20B%C3%A4hr">Johann Karl Bähr</a>, Alfred Heneage Cocks, Sir James Curle and Philippe Delamain respectively. However, the undoubted highlight from the early mediaeval period are the magnificent items from the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> royal grave, generously donated to the nation by the landowner <a href="Edith%20Pretty">Edith Pretty</a>. The department includes the national collection of <a href="horology">horology</a> with one of the most wide-ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. Choice horological pieces came from the <a href="Octavius%20Morgan">Morgan</a> and <a href="Courtenay%20Adrian%20Ilbert">Ilbert</a> collections. The department is also responsible for the curation of <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> objects – the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, the most important of which is the <a href="Mildenhall%20Treasure">Mildenhall Treasure</a>. The museum purchased many Roman-British objects from the antiquarian <a href="Charles%20Roach%20Smith">Charles Roach Smith</a> in 1856. These quickly formed the nucleus of the collection.

Objects from the Department of Prehistory and Europe are mostly found on the upper floor of the museum, with a suite of galleries numbered from 38 to 51. Most of the collection is stored in its <a href="archive">archive</a> facilities, where it is available for <a href="research">research</a> and study.

Key highlights of the collections include:

Stone Age (c. 3.4 million years BC – c. 2000 BC)

Bronze Age (c. 3300 BC – c. 600 BC)

Iron Age (c. 600 BC – c. 1st century AD)

Romano-British (43 AD – 410 AD)

Early Mediaeval (c. 4th century AD – c. 1000 AD)

Mediaeval (c. 1000 AD – c. 1500 AD)

Renaissance to Modern (c. 1500 AD – present)

The many hoards of treasure include those of <a href="Mildenhall%20Treasure">Mildenhall</a>, <a href="Esquiline%20Treasure">Esquiline</a>, <a href="Carthage%20Treasure">Carthage</a>, <a href="First%20Cyprus%20Treasure">First Cyprus</a>, <a href="Lampsacus%20Treasure">Lampsacus</a>, <a href="Water%20Newton%20Treasure">Water Newton</a>, <a href="Hoxne%20Hoard">Hoxne</a>, and <a href="Vale%20of%20York%20Hoard">Vale of York</a>, (4th–10th centuries AD)

The scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad; its collections of over 75,000 objects cover the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day. Until recently, this department concentrated on collecting Oriental antiquities from urban or semi-urban societies across the Asian continent. Many of those objects were collected by colonial officers and explorers in former parts of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, especially the Indian subcontinent. Examples include the collections made by individuals such as <a href="Hindu%20Stuart">Charles Stuart</a>, <a href="James%20Prinsep">James Prinsep</a>, <a href="Charles%20Masson">Charles Masson</a>, Sir <a href="Alexander%20Cunningham">Alexander Cunningham</a>, Sir <a href="Harold%20Arthur%20Deane">Harold Deane</a> and Sir <a href="John%20Marshall%20%28archaeologist%29">John Marshall</a>. A large number of Chinese antiquities were purchased from the Anglo-Greek banker <a href="George%20Eumorfopoulos">George Eumorfopoulos</a> in the 1930s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the <a href="philanthropist">philanthropist</a> PT Brooke Sewell, which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection.

In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and <a href="hunter-gatherers">hunter-gatherers</a>, many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a> (much assembled by the British naval officer <a href="Maurice%20Vidal%20Portman">Maurice Portman</a>), Sri Lanka (especially through the colonial administrator <a href="Hugh%20Nevill">Hugh Nevill</a>), Northern Thailand, south-west China, the <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a> of Hokaidu in Japan (chief among them the collection of the Scottish zoologist <a href="John%20Anderson%20%28zoologist%29">John Anderson</a>), Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. The latter benefited from the purchase in 1905 of the <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> collection put together by Dr <a href="Charles%20Hose">Charles Hose</a>, as well as from other colonial officers such as Edward A Jeffreys. In addition, a unique and valuable group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> musical set, was assembled by <a href="Sir%20Stamford%20Raffles">Sir Stamford Raffles</a>.

The principal gallery devoted to Asian art in the museum is Gallery 33 with its comprehensive display of Chinese, Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asian objects. An adjacent gallery showcases the Amaravati sculptures and monuments. Other galleries on the upper floors are devoted to its Japanese, Korean, painting and <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, and Chinese ceramics collections.

Key highlights of the collections include:


East Asia

South Asia

South-east Asia

The British Museum houses one of the world's most comprehensive collections of <a href="Ethnographic">Ethnographic</a> material from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, representing the cultures of <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> throughout the world. Over 350,000 objects spanning thousands of years tells the history of mankind from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing. Many individuals have added to the department's collection over the years but those assembled by <a href="Henry%20Christy">Henry Christy</a>, <a href="Harry%20Geoffrey%20Beasley">Harry Beasley</a> and <a href="William%20Ockelford%20Oldman">William Oldman</a> are outstanding. Objects from this department are mostly on display in several galleries on the ground and lower floors. Gallery 24 displays <a href="ethnographic">ethnographic</a> from every continent while adjacent galleries focus on <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. A long suite of rooms (Gallery 25) on the lower floor display African art. There are plans in place to develop permanent galleries for showcasing art from Oceania and South America.

Africa

The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir <a href="Henry%20Wellcome">Henry Wellcome</a>, which was donated by the <a href="Wellcome%20Collection">Wellcome Historical Medical Museum</a> in 1954. Highlights of the African collection include objects found at <a href="Senegambian%20stone%20circles">megalithic circles</a> in The Gambia, a dozen exquisite <a href="Kongo%20ivories%23Afro-Portuguese%20ivories">Afro-Portuguese ivories</a>, a series of soapstone figures from the <a href="Kissi%20people">Kissi people</a> in Sierra Leone and Liberia, Asante goldwork and regalia from Ghana including the <a href="Thomas%20Edward%20Bowdich">Bowdich</a> collection, the rare <a href="Akan%20Drum">Akan Drum</a> from the same region in west Africa, the <a href="Benin%20Bronzes">Benin</a> and <a href="Igbo-Ukwu">Igbo-Ukwu</a> bronze sculptures, the beautiful <a href="Bronze%20Head%20of%20Queen%20Idia">Bronze Head of Queen Idia</a>, a magnificent <a href="Bronze%20Head%20from%20Ife">brass head</a> of a Yoruba ruler and quartz throne from <a href="Ife">Ife</a>, a similar <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> head from Iwinrin Grove near Ife, the <a href="Apapa%20Hoard">Apapa Hoard</a> from Lagos, southern Nigeria, an <a href="Ikom%20monoliths">Ikom monolith</a> from <a href="Cross%20River%20State">Cross River State</a>, the <a href="Emil%20Torday">Torday</a> collection of central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry from the <a href="Kuba%20Kingdom">Kuba Kingdom</a> including three <a href="Ndop%20%28Kuba%29">royal figures</a>, the unique <a href="Luzira%20Head">Luzira Head</a> from Uganda, processional crosses and other ecclesiastical and royal material from <a href="Gondar">Gondar</a> and <a href="Amba%20Mariam">Magdala</a>, Ethiopia following the <a href="British%20Expedition%20to%20Abyssinia">British Expedition to Abyssinia</a>, excavated objects from <a href="Great%20Zimbabwe">Great Zimbabwe</a> (that includes a unique soapstone, <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> figure) and satellite towns such as <a href="Mutare">Mutare</a> including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the <a href="Venda">Venda</a> peoples and cave paintings and <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s from <a href="Wildebeest%20Kuil%20Rock%20Art%20Centre">South Africa</a>.

Oceania

The British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>, <a href="Melanesia">Melanesia</a> and <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a> – Aboriginal art from <a href="Australia">Australia</a> is considered separately in its own right. Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. Prehistoric objects from the region include a bird-shaped <a href="pestle">pestle</a> and a group of stone <a href="Pestle%20and%20mortar">mortars</a> from <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest Oceanic and Pacific collections, many of which were put together by members of <a href="James%20Cook">Cook</a>'s and <a href="George%20Vancouver">Vancouver</a>'s expeditions or by colonial administrators such as Sir <a href="George%20Grey">George Grey</a>, Sir <a href="Frederick%20Broome">Frederick Broome</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%201st%20Baron%20Stanmore">Arthur Gordon</a>, before Western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures. The <a href="Henry%20Wilson%20%28sailor%29">Wilson</a> cabinet of curiosities from <a href="Palau">Palau</a> is another example of pre-contact ware. The department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering <a href="anthropology">anthropologists</a> such as <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Malinowski">Bronisław Malinowski</a> and <a href="Katherine%20Routledge">Katherine Routledge</a>. In addition, the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20culture">Māori</a> collection is the finest outside New Zealand with many intricately carved wooden and <a href="Hei-tiki">jade objects</a> and the <a href="Aboriginal%20art">Aboriginal art</a> collection is distinguished by its wide range of <a href="bark%20paintings">bark paintings</a>, including two very early bark etchings collected by <a href="John%20Hunter%20Kerr">John Hunter Kerr</a>. A poignant artefact is the wooden shield found near <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> during Cook's first voyage in 1770. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> in 1911, that includes the unique <a href="statue%20of%20A%27a%20from%20Rurutu">statue of A'a from Rurutu</a> Island, the rare <a href="Mangareva%20Statue">idol</a> from the isle of Mangareva and the Cook Islands <a href="Deity%20Figure%20from%20Rarotonga">deity figure</a>. Other highlights include the huge Hawaiian statue of <a href="K%C5%AB">Kū-ka-ili-moku</a> or god of war (one of three extant in the world) and the famous Easter Island statues <a href="Hoa%20Hakananai%27a">Hoa Hakananai'a</a> and <a href="Relocation%20of%20moai%20objects">Moai Hava</a>.

Americas

The Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the <a href="Paracas%20culture">Paracas</a>, <a href="Moche%20culture">Moche</a>, <a href="Inca">Inca</a>, <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a>, <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>, <a href="Taino">Taino</a> and other early cultures are well represented. The <a href="Kayung%20totem%20pole">Kayung totem pole</a>, which was made in the late nineteenth century in the <a href="Queen%20Charlotte%20Islands">Queen Charlotte Islands</a>, dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide-ranging collections that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Aboriginal Canadian</a> objects from Alaska and Canada collected by the <a href="Hugh%20Lowther%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Lonsdale">5th Earl of Lonsdale</a> and the <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%209th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">Marquis of Lorne</a>, the <a href="E.%20G.%20Squier">Squier</a> and <a href="Edwin%20Hamilton%20Davis">Davis</a> collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a selection of pottery vessels found in cliff-dwellings at <a href="Mesa%20Verde">Mesa Verde</a>, a collection of turquoise Aztec <a href="Double-headed%20serpent">mosaics</a> from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from <a href="Teotihuacan%20Ocelot">Teotihuacan</a> and <a href="Isla%20de%20Sacrificios">Isla de Sacrificios</a>, several rare pre-Columbian manuscripts including the <a href="Codex%20Zouche-Nuttall">Codex Zouche-Nuttall</a> and <a href="Codex%20Waecker-Gotter">Codex Waecker-Gotter</a>, a spectacular series of Mayan <a href="Yaxchilan%20Lintel%2024">lintels</a> from <a href="Yaxchilan">Yaxchilan</a> excavated by the British Mayanist <a href="Alfred%20Maudslay">Alfred Maudslay</a>, a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from <a href="Cop%C3%A1n%20Bench%20Panel">Copan</a>, <a href="Tikal%20Temple%20I">Tikal</a>, <a href="Tulum%20Stela%201">Tulum</a>, <a href="Pusilha">Pusilha</a>, <a href="Naranjo">Naranjo</a> and <a href="Nebaj">Nebaj</a> (including the celebrated <a href="Fenton%20Vase">Fenton Vase</a>), a group of <a href="Zemi%20Figures%20from%20Vere%2C%20Jamaica">Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica</a>, a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and <a href="Lake%20Guatavita">votive</a> objects from Colombia, ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the <a href="Robert%20Hermann%20Schomburgk">Schomburgk</a> collection, two rare <a href="Tiwanaku">Tiwanaku</a> pottery vessels from <a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> and important items from <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> donated by Commander <a href="Phillip%20Parker%20King">Phillip Parker King</a>.

The British Museum is home to one of the world's finest <a href="Numismatics">numismatic</a> collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the <a href="Eastern%20world">East</a> and <a href="Western%20world">West</a>. The Department of Coins and Medals was created in 1861 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2011.

This department was founded in 1920. <a href="Conservation%20%28cultural%20heritage%29">Conservation</a> has six specialist areas: ceramics & glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.

This department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The Museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general Museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application. The <a href="Anthropology">Anthropology</a> Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes. However, the <a href="Paul%20Hamlyn">Paul Hamlyn</a> Library, which had become the central reference library of the British Museum and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed permanently in August 2011. The website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.

The British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a division of the British Museum Company Ltd, a company and a charity (established in 1973) wholly owned by the Trustees of the British Museum.

The BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British Museum.

Scholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all of which are <a href="peer-reviewed">peer-reviewed</a>. This series was started in 1978 and was originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection. Between six and eight titles are published each year in this series.

It is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artifacts taken from other countries, and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>, <a href="Benin%20Bronzes">Benin Bronzes</a> and the <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries of <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> respectively. Parthenon Marbles claimed by Greece were also claimed by UNESCO among others for restitution. From 1801 to 1812, Elgin's agents took about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon, as well as sculptures from the Propylaea and Erechtheum.

In recent years, controversies pertaining to reparation of artefacts taken from the <a href="Old%20Summer%20Palace">Old Summer Palace</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> during the <a href="Anglo-French%20invasion%20of%20China">Anglo-French invasion of China</a> in 1860 have also begun to surface. The ransacking and destruction of the Chinese palaces has led to unhealed historical wounds in Chinese culture. <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> condemned the French and British for their plundering. The British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum, among others, have been asked since 2009 to open their archives for investigation by a team of Chinese investigators as a part of an international mission to document lost national treasures. However, there have been fears that the United Kingdom may be asked to return these treasures. , <a href="Neil%20MacGregor">Neil MacGregor</a>, the Director of the British Museum, said he hoped that both British and Chinese investigators would work together on the controversial collection, which continues to result in resentment in China.

The British Museum has refused to return these artefacts, stating that the "restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world". The Museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 legally prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. Nevertheless, it has returned items such as the Tasmanian Ashes after a 20-year-long battle with Australia.

The British Museum continues to assert that it is an appropriate custodian and has an inalienable right to its disputed artefacts under <a href="British%20law">British law</a>.

In 2016, the British Museum moved its bag searches to marquees in the front courtyard and beside the rear entrance. This has been criticised by heritage groups as out-of-character with the historic building. The British Museum clarified that the change was purely logistical to save space in the main museum entrance and did not reflect any escalation in threat.

Binomial theorem

In <a href="elementary%20algebra">elementary algebra</a>, the binomial theorem (or binomial expansion) describes the algebraic expansion of <a href="exponentiation">powers</a> of a <a href="binomial%20%28polynomial%29">binomial</a>. According to the theorem, it is possible to expand the polynomial into a <a href="summation">sum</a> involving terms of the form , where the exponents and are <a href="nonnegative%20integer">nonnegative integer</a>s with , and the <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a> of each term is a specific <a href="positive%20integer">positive integer</a> depending on and . For example,

The coefficient in the term of is known as the <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> formula_2 or formula_3 (the two have the same value). These coefficients for varying and can be arranged to form <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>. These numbers also arise in <a href="combinatorics">combinatorics</a>, where formula_2 gives the number of different <a href="combinations">combinations</a> of <a href="element%20%28mathematics%29">elements</a> that can be chosen from an -element <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>.

Special cases of the binomial theorem were known from ancient times. The 4th century B.C. <a href="Greek%20mathematics">Greek mathematician</a> <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> mentioned the special case of the binomial theorem for exponent 2. There is evidence that the binomial theorem for cubes was known by the 6th century in India.

Binomial coefficients, as combinatorial quantities expressing the number of ways of selecting "k" objects out of "n" without replacement, were of interest to the ancient Hindus. The earliest known reference to this combinatorial problem is the "Chandaḥśāstra" by the Hindu lyricist <a href="Pingala">Pingala</a> (c. 200 B.C.), which contains a method for its solution. The commentator <a href="Halayudha">Halayudha</a> from the 10th century A.D. explains this method using what is now known as <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>. By the 6th century A.D., the Hindu mathematicians probably knew how to express this as a quotient formula_5, and a clear statement of this rule can be found in the 12th century text "Lilavati" by <a href="Bh%C4%81skara%20II">Bhaskara</a>.

The binomial theorem as such can be found in the work of 11th-century <a href="Islamic%20mathematics">Persian mathematician</a> <a href="Al-Karaji">Al-Karaji</a>, who described the triangular pattern of the binomial coefficients. He also provided a <a href="mathematical%20proof">mathematical proof</a> of both the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, using a primitive form of <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a>. The Persian poet and mathematician <a href="Omar%20Khayyam">Omar Khayyam</a> was probably familiar with the formula to higher orders, although many of his mathematical works are lost. The binomial expansions of small degrees were known in the 13th century mathematical works of <a href="Yang%20Hui">Yang Hui</a> and also <a href="Chu%20Shih-Chieh">Chu Shih-Chieh</a>. Yang Hui attributes the method to a much earlier 11th century text of <a href="Jia%20Xian">Jia Xian</a>, although those writings are now also lost.

In 1544, <a href="Michael%20Stifel">Michael Stifel</a> introduced the term "binomial coefficient" and showed how to use them to express formula_6 in terms of formula_7, via "Pascal's triangle". <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> studied the eponymous triangle comprehensively in the <a href="treatise">treatise</a> "Traité du triangle arithmétique" (1653). However, the pattern of numbers was already known to the European mathematicians of the late Renaissance, including Stifel, <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Fontana%20Tartaglia">Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia</a>, and <a href="Simon%20Stevin">Simon Stevin</a>.

<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, valid for any rational exponent.

According to the theorem, it is possible
to expand any power of "x" + "y" into a sum of the form
where each formula_9 is a specific positive integer known as a <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>. (When an exponent is zero, the corresponding power expression is taken to be 1 and this multiplicative factor is often omitted from the term. Hence one often sees the right side written as formula_10.) This formula is also referred to as the binomial formula or the binomial identity. Using <a href="Capital-sigma%20notation">summation notation</a>, it can be written as
The final expression follows from the previous one by the symmetry of "x" and "y" in the first expression, and by comparison it follows that the sequence of binomial coefficients in the formula is symmetrical.
A simple variant of the binomial formula is obtained by <a href="substitution%20%28algebra%29">substituting</a> 1 for "y", so that it involves only a single <a href="Variable%20%28mathematics%29">variable</a>. In this form, the formula reads
or equivalently

The most basic example of the binomial theorem is the formula for the <a href="Square%20%28algebra%29">square</a> of :

The binomial coefficients 1, 2, 1 appearing in this expansion correspond to the second row of Pascal's triangle. (Note that the top "1" of the triangle is considered to be row 0, by convention.) The coefficients of higher powers of correspond to lower rows of the triangle:

Several patterns can be observed from these examples. In general, for the expansion :

The binomial theorem can be applied to the powers of any binomial. For example,

For a binomial involving subtraction, the theorem can be applied by using the form . This has the effect of changing the sign of every other term in the expansion:

For positive values of "a" and "b", the binomial theorem with "n" = 2 is the geometrically evident fact that a square of side can be cut into a square of side "a", a square of side "b", and two rectangles with sides "a" and "b". With "n" = 3, the theorem states that a cube of side can be cut into a cube of side "a", a cube of side "b", three "a"×"a"×"b" rectangular boxes, and three "a"×"b"×"b" rectangular boxes.

In <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, this picture also gives a geometric proof of the <a href="derivative">derivative</a> formula_18 if one sets formula_19 and formula_20 interpreting "b" as an <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a> change in "a," then this picture shows the infinitesimal change in the volume of an "n"-dimensional <a href="hypercube">hypercube</a>, formula_21 where the coefficient of the linear term (in formula_22) is formula_23 the area of the "n" faces, each of dimension formula_24
Substituting this into the <a href="definition%20of%20the%20derivative">definition of the derivative</a> via a <a href="difference%20quotient">difference quotient</a> and taking limits means that the higher order terms, formula_26 and higher, become negligible, and yields the formula formula_27 interpreted as
If one integrates this picture, which corresponds to applying the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>, one obtains <a href="Cavalieri%27s%20quadrature%20formula">Cavalieri's quadrature formula</a>, the integral formula_29 – see <a href="Cavalieri%27s%20quadrature%20formula%23Proof">proof of Cavalieri's quadrature formula</a> for details.

The coefficients that appear in the binomial expansion are called binomial coefficients. These are usually written formula_9, and pronounced “"n" choose "k"”.

The coefficient of "x""y" is given by the formula

which is defined in terms of the <a href="factorial">factorial</a> function "n"!. Equivalently, this formula can be written

with "k" factors in both the numerator and denominator of the <a href="Fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fraction</a>. Note that, although this formula involves a fraction, the binomial coefficient formula_9 is actually an <a href="integer">integer</a>.

The binomial coefficient formula_9 can be interpreted as the number of ways to choose "k" elements from an "n"-element set. This is related to binomials for the following reason: if we write ("x" + "y") as a <a href="Product%20%28mathematics%29">product</a>
then, according to the <a href="distributive%20law">distributive law</a>, there will be one term in the expansion for each choice of either "x" or "y" from each of the binomials of the product. For example, there will only be one term "x", corresponding to choosing "x" from each binomial. However, there will be several terms of the form "x""y", one for each way of choosing exactly two binomials to contribute a "y". Therefore, after <a href="combining%20like%20terms">combining like terms</a>, the coefficient of "x""y" will be equal to the number of ways to choose exactly 2 elements from an "n"-element set.

The coefficient of "xy" in

equals formula_37 because there are three "x","y" strings of length 3 with exactly two "y"'s, namely,

corresponding to the three 2-element subsets of { 1, 2, 3 }, namely,

where each subset specifies the positions of the "y" in a corresponding string.

Expanding ("x" + "y") yields the sum of the 2 products of the form "e""e" ... "e" where each "e" is "x" or "y". Rearranging factors shows that each product equals "x""y" for some "k" between 0 and "n". For a given "k", the following are proved equal in succession:
This proves the binomial theorem.

<a href="mathematical%20induction">Induction</a> yields another proof of the binomial theorem. When "n" = 0, both sides equal 1, since "x" = 1 and formula_43.
Now suppose that the equality holds for a given "n"; we will prove it for "n" + 1.
For "j", "k" ≥ 0, let ["ƒ"("x", "y")] denote the coefficient of "x""y" in the polynomial "ƒ"("x", "y").
By the inductive hypothesis, ("x" + "y") is a polynomial in "x" and "y" such that [("x" + "y")] is formula_44 if "j" + "k" = "n", and 0 otherwise.
The identity

shows that ("x" + "y") also is a polynomial in "x" and "y", and

since if "j" + "k" = "n" + 1, then ("j" − 1) + "k" = "n" and "j" + ("k" − 1) = "n". Now, the right hand side is

by <a href="Pascal%27s%20identity">Pascal's identity</a>. On the other hand, if "j" +"k" ≠ "n" + 1, then ("j" – 1) + "k" ≠ "n" and "j" +("k" – 1) ≠ "n", so we get 0 + 0 = 0. Thus

which is the inductive hypothesis with "n" + 1 substituted for "n" and so completes the inductive step.

Around 1665, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> generalized the binomial theorem to allow real exponents other than nonnegative integers. (The same generalization also applies to <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> exponents.) In this generalization, the finite sum is replaced by an <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a>. In order to do this, one needs to give meaning to binomial coefficients with an arbitrary upper index, which cannot be done using the usual formula with factorials. However, for an arbitrary number "r", one can define

where formula_50 is the <a href="Pochhammer%20symbol">Pochhammer symbol</a>, here standing for a <a href="falling%20factorial">falling factorial</a>. This agrees with the usual definitions when "r" is a nonnegative integer. Then, if "x" and "y" are real numbers with |"x"| > |"y"|, and "r" is any complex number, one has

When "r" is a nonnegative integer, the binomial coefficients for "k" > "r" are zero, so this equation reduces to the usual binomial theorem, and there are at most "r" + 1 nonzero terms. For other values of "r", the series typically has infinitely many nonzero terms.

For example, with "r" = 1/2 gives the following series for the square root:

Taking formula_53, the generalized binomial series gives the <a href="Geometric%20series%23Formula">geometric series formula</a>, valid for formula_54:

More generally, with "r" = −"s":

So, for instance, when formula_57,

The generalized binomial theorem can be extended to the case where "x" and "y" are complex numbers. For this version, one should again assume |"x"| > |"y"| and define the powers of "x" + "y" and "x" using a <a href="Holomorphic%20function">holomorphic</a> <a href="complex%20logarithm">branch of log</a> defined on an open disk of radius |"x"| centered at "x".

The generalized binomial theorem is valid also for elements "x" and "y" of a <a href="Banach%20algebra">Banach algebra</a> as long as "xy" = "yx", "x" is invertible, and ||"y/x"|| < 1.

The binomial theorem can be generalized to include powers of sums with more than two terms. The general version is

where the summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices "k" through "k" such that the sum of all "k" is "n". (For each term in the expansion, the exponents must add up to "n"). The coefficients formula_60 are known as multinomial coefficients, and can be computed by the formula

Combinatorially, the multinomial coefficient formula_62 counts the number of different ways to <a href="Partition%20of%20a%20set">partition</a> an "n"-element set into <a href="Disjoint%20sets">disjoint</a> <a href="subset">subset</a>s of sizes "k", ..., "k".

It is often useful when working in more dimensions, to deal with products of binomial expressions. By the binomial theorem this is equal to

This may be written more concisely, by <a href="multi-index%20notation">multi-index notation</a>, as

For the <a href="complex%20numbers">complex numbers</a> the binomial theorem can be combined with <a href="De%20Moivre%27s%20formula">De Moivre's formula</a> to yield <a href="List%20of%20trigonometric%20identities%23Multiple-angle%20formulae">multiple-angle formulas</a> for the <a href="sine">sine</a> and <a href="cosine">cosine</a>. According to De Moivre's formula,

Using the binomial theorem, the expression on the right can be expanded, and then the real and imaginary parts can be taken to yield formulas for cos("nx") and sin("nx"). For example, since
De Moivre's formula tells us that
which are the usual double-angle identities. Similarly, since
De Moivre's formula yields
In general,
and

The <a href="e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">number "e"</a> is often defined by the formula

Applying the binomial theorem to this expression yields the usual <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a> for "e". In particular:

The "k"th term of this sum is

As "n" → ∞, the rational expression on the right approaches one, and therefore

This indicates that "e" can be written as a series:

Indeed, since each term of the binomial expansion is an <a href="Monotonic%20function">increasing function</a> of "n", it follows from the <a href="monotone%20convergence%20theorem">monotone convergence theorem</a> for series that the sum of this infinite series is equal to "e".

In finding the derivative of the power function "f"("x") = "x" for integer "n" using the definition of derivative, one can expand the binomial ("x" + "h").

To indicate the formula for the derivative of order "n" of the product of two functions, the formula of the binomial theorem is used symbolically.

The binomial theorem is closely related to the probability mass function of the <a href="negative%20binomial%20distribution">negative binomial distribution</a>. The probability of a (countable) collection of independent Bernoulli trials formula_77 with probability of success formula_78 all not happening is formula_79A useful upper bound for this quantity is formula_80. 

Formula (1) is valid more generally for any elements "x" and "y" of a <a href="semiring">semiring</a> satisfying "xy" = "yx". The <a href="theorem">theorem</a> is true even more generally: <a href="alternativity">alternativity</a> suffices in place of <a href="associativity">associativity</a>.

The binomial theorem can be stated by saying that the <a href="polynomial%20sequence">polynomial sequence</a> { 1, "x", "x", "x", ... } is of <a href="binomial%20type">binomial type</a>.

Boxing Day

Boxing Day is a holiday celebrated the day after <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a>. It originated in the United Kingdom, and is celebrated in a number of countries that previously formed part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Boxing Day is on 26 December, although the attached <a href="bank%20holiday">bank holiday</a> or <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a> may take place either on that day or two days later.

In the <a href="Liturgical%20year">liturgical calendar</a> of <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a>, Boxing Day is the <a href="Twelve%20Days%20of%20Christmas">second day</a> of <a href="Christmastide">Christmastide</a>, and also <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Day">St. Stephen's Day</a>. In some European countries, notably Germany, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, 26 December is celebrated as a Second Christmas Day.

There are competing theories for the origins of the term, none of which is definitive. The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" gives the earliest attestations from Britain in the 1830s, defining it as "the first week-day after Christmas-day, observed as a holiday on which post-men, errand-boys, and servants of various kinds expect to receive a Christmas-box".

The term "Christmas-box" dates back to the 17th century, and among other things meant:

A present or gratuity given at Christmas: in Great Britain, usually confined to gratuities given to those who are supposed to have a vague claim upon the donor for services rendered to him as one of the general public by whom they are employed and paid, or as a customer of their legal employer; the undefined theory being that as they have done offices for this person, for which he has not directly paid them, some direct acknowledgement is becoming at Christmas.

In Britain, it was a custom for tradespeople to collect "Christmas boxes" of money or presents on the first weekday after Christmas as thanks for good service throughout the year. This is mentioned in <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>' diary entry for 19 December 1663. This custom is linked to an older British tradition: since they would have to wait on their masters on Christmas Day, the servants of the wealthy were allowed the next day to visit their families. The employers would give each servant a box to take home containing gifts, bonuses, and sometimes leftover food.

In South Africa (a former British colony) as recently as the 1980s, milkmen and garbage collectors, who normally had little if any interaction with those they served, were accustomed to knock on their doors asking for a "Christmas box", being a small cash donation, in the week or so before and after Christmas.

The European tradition, which has long included giving money and other gifts to those who were needy and in service positions, has been dated to the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, but the exact origin is unknown. It is believed to be in reference to the Alms Box placed in areas of worship to collect donations to the poor. Also, it may come from a custom in the late Roman/early Christian era, wherein metal boxes placed outside churches were used to collect special offerings tied to the <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Day">Feast of Saint Stephen</a>, which in the <a href="Latin%20Church">Western Church</a> falls on the same day as Boxing Day.

Boxing Day is a <a href="secular%20holiday">secular holiday</a> that is traditionally celebrated on 26 December, the day after Christmas Day. 26 December is also <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Day">St. Stephen's Day</a>, a <a href="religious%20holiday">religious holiday</a>.

In the UK, Boxing Day is a <a href="bank%20holiday">bank holiday</a> (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 1871). When 26 December falls on a Saturday, the Boxing Day <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a> is moved to the substitute day, which is the following Monday. If 26 December falls on a Sunday, the substitute <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a> is the following Tuesday. As Boxing Day was traditionally the first week day (historically Monday–Saturday) after Christmas, it cannot technically be on a Sunday as that is considered to be the day of worship. However, 26 December is nowadays generally referred to as Boxing Day, even when it falls on the Sunday.

In Scotland, Boxing Day has been specified as an additional bank holiday since 1974, by <a href="Royal%20Proclamation">Royal Proclamation</a> under the <a href="Banking%20and%20Financial%20Dealings%20Act%201971">Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971</a>.

In <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> – when the island as a whole was part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> – the <a href="Bank%20Holidays%20Act%201871">Bank Holidays Act 1871</a> established the feast day of <a href="St.%20Stephen">St. Stephen</a> as a non-movable public holiday on 26 December. Following <a href="Partition%20of%20Ireland">partition in 1920</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> reverted to the British name, Boxing Day.

In Australia, Boxing Day is a federal public holiday. The Australian state of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> instead observes a public holiday known as <a href="Proclamation%20Day">Proclamation Day</a> on the first weekday after Christmas Day or the Christmas Day holiday.

In New Zealand, Boxing Day is a statutory holiday; penalty rates and lieu time are provided to employees who work on Boxing Day.

In Canada, Boxing Day is a federal statutory holiday. Government offices, banks and post offices/delivery are closed. In some Canadian provinces, Boxing Day is a statutory holiday that is always celebrated on 26 December. In Canadian provinces where Boxing Day was a statutory holiday, and it falls on a Saturday or Sunday, compensation days are given in the following week.

In the United States, 26 December is not observed as "Boxing Day", per se, by the Federal Government; however, it may be converted to an extension of "Christmas Day Observed" when Christmas falls on a Sunday, thus affecting Federal offices and services, as well as banking, regular postal delivery and trading markets. The 26th is given as a holiday to some state employees, mainly in <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern</a> states: Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, but it is not known as Boxing Day. On 5 December 1996, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Gov. <a href="William%20F.%20Weld">William F. Weld</a> declared 26 December as Boxing Day in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, in response to the efforts of a local coalition of British citizens to "transport the English tradition to the United States", but not as an employee holiday.

In Nigeria, 26 December is a public holiday for working people or students. When it falls on Saturday or Sunday, there is always a holiday on Monday.

In the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday, much like <a href="Black%20Friday%20%28shopping%29">Black Friday</a> (the day after <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a>) in the United States. Boxing Day sales are common in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is a time when shops hold sales, often with dramatic price reductions. For many merchants, Boxing Day has become the day of the year with the greatest revenue. In the UK in 2009 it was estimated that up to 12 million shoppers appeared at the sales (a rise of almost 20% compared to 2008, although this was also affected by the fact that the <a href="VAT">VAT</a> was about to revert to 17.5% from 1 January, following the temporary reduction to 15%).

Many retailers open very early (typically 5 am or even earlier) and offer <a href="doorbuster">doorbuster</a> deals and <a href="loss%20leader">loss leader</a>s to draw people to their stores. It is not uncommon for long queues to form early in the morning of 26 December, hours before the opening of shops holding the big sales, especially at <a href="Big-box%20store">big-box consumer electronics</a> retailers. Many stores have a limited quantity of big draw or deeply discounted items. Because of the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, many choose to stay at home and avoid the hectic shopping experience. The local media often cover the event, mentioning how early the shoppers began queuing up, and showing video of shoppers queuing and later leaving with their purchased items. Many retailers have implemented practices aimed at managing large numbers of shoppers. They may limit entrances, restrict the number of patrons in a store at a time, provide tickets to people at the head of the queue to guarantee them a hot ticket item or canvass queued-up shoppers to inform them of inventory limitations.

In recent years, retailers have expanded deals to "<a href="Boxing%20Week">Boxing Week</a>". While Boxing Day is 26 December, many retailers will run the sales for several days before or after 26 December, often up to New Year's Eve. Notably, in <a href="Late%202000s%20recession">the recession of late 2008</a>, a record number of retailers were holding early promotions due to a weak economy. Canada's Boxing Day has often been compared with the American <a href="Super%20Saturday">Super Saturday</a> (the Saturday before Christmas) and <a href="Black%20Friday%20%28shopping%29">Black Friday</a>. From 2009 onward Black Friday deals become more prominent among Canadian retailers to discourage shoppers from crossing the border to the USA when the Canadian and USA dollars was close to parity, and this has lessened the appeal of Boxing Day in Canada somewhat as it was overtaken by Black Friday in terms of sales in 2013. Boxing Day is not and has never been a shopping holiday in the USA.

In some areas of Canada, particularly in <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a> and parts of <a href="Northern%20Ontario">Northern Ontario</a>, most retailers are prohibited from opening on Boxing Day, either by provincial law or by municipal <a href="bylaw">bylaw</a>, or instead by informal agreement among major retailers to provide a day of relaxation following Christmas Day. In these areas, sales otherwise scheduled for 26 December are moved to the 27th. The city council of <a href="Greater%20Sudbury">Greater Sudbury</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, which was the largest city in Canada to maintain this restriction as of the early 2010s, formally repealed its store hours bylaw on 9 December 2014.

In 2009, many retailers with both online and <a href="High%20Street">High Street</a> stores launched their online sales on Christmas Eve and their High Street sales on Boxing Day.

In the United Kingdom, it is traditional for both top-tier <a href="Association%20football">football</a> leagues in <a href="Premier%20League">England</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Premiership">Scotland</a> and <a href="NIFL%20Premiership">Northern Ireland</a>, and the lower ones, as well as the <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> leagues, to hold a full programme of <a href="association%20football">football</a> and <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> matches on Boxing Day. Originally, matches on Boxing Day were played against <a href="local%20derby">local rivals</a> to avoid teams and their fans having to travel a long distance to an away game on the day after Christmas Day. Prior to the formation of leagues, a number of rugby fixtures took place on Boxing Day each year, notably <a href="Llanelli%20RFC">Llanelli</a> v <a href="London%20Welsh%20RFC">London Welsh</a> and <a href="Leicester%20Tigers">Leicester</a> v <a href="Barbarian%20F.C.">The Barbarians</a>.

In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> matches are played on Boxing Day: for more details see <a href="Boxing%20Day%20Test">Boxing Day Test</a>.

In Australia, the first day of the <a href="Boxing%20Day%20Test">Boxing Day Test</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and the start of the <a href="Sydney%20to%20Hobart%20Yacht%20Race">Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race</a> are on Boxing Day.

In horse racing, there is the <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Chase">King George VI Chase</a> at <a href="Kempton%20Park%20Racecourse">Kempton Park Racecourse</a> in Surrey, England. It is the second most prestigious <a href="National%20Hunt%20racing">chase</a> in Britain, after the <a href="Cheltenham%20Gold%20Cup">Cheltenham Gold Cup</a>. In addition to the prestigious race at Kempton, in Britain it is usually the day with the highest number of racing meetings of the year, with eight in 2016, in addition to three more in Ireland.

Boxing Day is one of the main days in the hunting calendar for <a href="list%20of%20foxhound%20packs%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">hunts</a> in the UK and US, with most hunts (both mounted foxhound or harrier packs and foot packs of beagles or bassets) holding meets, often in town or village centres.

Several <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> contests are associated with the day. The <a href="IIHF%20World%20U20%20Championship">IIHF World U20 Championship</a> typically begins on 26 December, while the <a href="Spengler%20Cup">Spengler Cup</a> also begins on 26 December in <a href="Davos">Davos</a>, Switzerland; the Spengler Cup competition includes <a href="HC%20Davos">HC Davos</a>, <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a>, and other top European Hockey teams. The <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> traditionally had close to a full slate of games (10 were played in 2011), following the league-wide days off given for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. However, the 2013 collective bargaining agreement (which followed <a href="2012-13%20NHL%20lockout">a lock-out</a>) extended the league mandate of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day off to include Boxing Day, except when it falls on a Saturday, in which case the league can choose to make 23 December a league-wide off day instead for that year. In some African <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> nations, particularly Ghana, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania, prize fighting contests are held on Boxing Day. This practice has also been followed for decades in Guyana and Italy.

A notable tradition in Sweden is "<a href="Saint%20Stephen%27s%20Day%20bandy">Annandagsbandy</a>", which formerly marked the start of the <a href="bandy">bandy</a> season and always draws large crowds. Games traditionally begin at 1:15 pm.

Centuries before the arrival of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> in the 7th Century, parts of Balochistan was ruled by the <a href="Paratarajas">Paratarajas</a>, an <a href="Indo-Scythians">Indo-Scythian</a> dynasty. At certain times, the <a href="Kushans">Kushans</a> also held political sway in parts of Balochistan.

A theory of the origin of the <a href="Baloch%20people">Baloch people</a>, the largest ethnic group in the region, is that they are of <a href="Medes">Median</a> descent, and are a Kurdish group that has absorbed <a href="Ancient%20Dravidian%20culture">Dravidian</a> genes and cultural traits, primarily from <a href="Brahui%20people">Brahui people</a>.

In 654, Abdulrehman ibn Samrah, governor of Sistan and the newly emerged <a href="Rashidun%20caliphate">Rashidun caliphate</a> at the expense of Sassanid Persia and the Byzantine Empire, sent an Islamic army to crush a revolt in <a href="Zaranj">Zaranj</a>, which is now in southern Afghanistan. After conquering Zaranj, a column of the army pushed north, conquering <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> and <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a>, in the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> mountain range, while another column moved through <a href="Quetta%20District">Quetta District</a> in north-western Balochistan and conquered the area up to the ancient cities of "Dawar" and "Qandabil" (<a href="Bolan%20District">Bolan</a>). It is documented that the major settlements, falling within today's province, became in 654 controlled by the Rashidun caliphate, except for the well-defended mountain town of "QaiQan" which is now <a href="Kalat%2C%20Pakistan">Kalat</a>.

During the caliphate of Ali, revolt broke out in southern Balochistan's Makran region. In 663, during the reign of <a href="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> Caliph <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Muawiyah I</a> his Muslim rule lost control of north-eastern Balochistan and Kalat when Haris ibn Marah and a large part of his army died in battle against a revolt in Kalat.

In the 15th century, <a href="Mir%20Chakar%20Khan%20Rind">Mir Chakar Khan Rind</a> became the first <a href="Sirdar">Sirdar</a> of Afghan and Pakistani Balochistan, he was a close aide of the <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid</a> ruler <a href="Humayun">Humayun</a>, and was succeeded by the <a href="Khanate%20of%20Kalat">Khanate of Kalat</a>, which owed allegiance to the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, and later <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> won the allegiance of the rulers of eastern Balochistan, he ceded <a href="Kalhora">Kalhora</a>, one of the <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> territories of <a href="Sibi">Sibi</a>-Kachi to the <a href="Khanate%20of%20Kalat">Khanate of Kalat</a>. <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a>, founder of the Afghan Empire, also won the allegiance of that area's rulers. Most of the area would eventually revert to local Baloch control – after Afghan rule, many Baloch fought during the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Panipat">Third Battle of Panipat</a>.

During the period of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> from the fall of the <a href="Durrani%20Empire">Durrani Empire</a> in 1823 four <a href="Princely%20State">Princely State</a>s were recognised and reinforced in Balochistan: <a href="Makran%20%28princely%20state%29">Makran</a>, <a href="Kharan%20%28princely%20state%29">Kharan</a>, <a href="Las%20Bela%20%28princely%20state%29">Las Bela</a> and <a href="Kalat%20%28princely%20state%29">Kalat</a>. In 1876, <a href="Robert%20Groves%20Sandeman">Robert Sandeman</a> negotiated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Kalat">Treaty of Kalat</a>, which brought the Khan's territories, including Kharan, Makran, and Las Bela, under British protection even though they remained independent Princely states. After the <a href="Second%20Afghan%20War">Second Afghan War</a> was ended by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Gandamak">Treaty of Gandamak</a> in May 1879, the <a href="Mohammad%20Yaqub%20Khan">Afghan Emir</a> ceded the districts of Quetta, <a href="Pishin%20District">Pishin</a>, <a href="Harnai%20District">Harnai</a>, Sibi and <a href="Thal%20Chotiali">Thal Chotiali</a> to British control. On 1 April 1883, the British took control of the <a href="Bolan%20Pass">Bolan Pass</a>, south-east of Quetta, from the <a href="Khan%20of%20Kalat">Khan of Kalat</a>. In 1887, small additional areas of Balochistan were declared British territory. In 1893, Sir <a href="Mortimer%20Durand">Mortimer Durand</a> negotiated an agreement with the <a href="Amir">Amir</a> of Afghanistan, <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a>, to fix the <a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a> running from <a href="Chitral">Chitral</a> to Balochistan as the boundary between the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Emirate of Afghanistan</a> and British-controlled areas. Two devastating earthquakes occurred in Balochistan during British colonial rule: the <a href="1935%20Balochistan%20earthquake">1935 Balochistan earthquake</a>, which devastated <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a>, and the <a href="1945%20Balochistan%20earthquake">1945 Balochistan earthquake</a> with its epicentre in the Makran region.

Balochistan contained a <a href="Baluchistan%20%28Chief%20Commissioner%27s%20Province%29">Chief Commissioner's province</a> and four <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a>s under the British Raj. The province's Shahi Jirga and the non-official members of the Quetta Municipality opted for Pakistan unanimously on 29 June 1947. Three of the princely states, <a href="Makran%20%28princely%20state%29">Makran</a>, <a href="Las%20Bela%20%28princely%20state%29">Las Bela</a> and <a href="Kharan%20%28princely%20state%29">Kharan</a>, acceded to Pakistan in 1947 after <a href="Pakistan%20Movement">independence</a>. But the ruler of the fourth princely state, the <a href="Khan%20of%20Kalat">Khan of Kalat</a>, <a href="Ahmad%20Yar%20Khan">Ahmad Yar Khan</a>, who used to call Jinnah his 'father', declared <a href="Kalat%20%28princely%20state%29">Kalat</a>'s independence as this was one of the options given to all of the 535 <a href="princely%20states">princely states</a> by British Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>.

Kalat was annexed by Pakistan on March 27, 1948 after wide military operation by Pakistan. Prince Ahmad Yar Khan was house arrested and forced to sign that led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against Pakistan in July 1948. Princes Agha Abdul Karim Baloch and Muhammad Rahim, refused to lay down arms, leading the Dosht-e Jhalawan in unconventional attacks on the army until 1950. The Princes fought a lone battle with outdated weapons. Jinnah and his successors allowed Yar Khan to retain his title until the province's dissolution in 1955.

<a href="Balochistan%20conflict">Insurgencies</a> by Baloch nationalists took place in 1948, 1958–59, 1962–63 and 1973–77 – with a new and reportedly stronger ongoing insurgency by autonomy-seeking Baloch groups beginning in 2003. While most Baloch support freedom from Pakistan. forceful disappearances have forced the local population to not talk on freedom.

At a press conference on 8 June 2015 in Quetta, Home Minister Sarfraz Bugti accused India's prime minister of openly supporting terrorism. Bugti implicated India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of being responsible for recent attacks at military bases in Smangli and Khalid, and for subverting the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) agreement.

Balochistan is situated in the southwest of Pakistan and covers an area of . It is Pakistan's largest province by area, constituting 44% of Pakistan's total land mass. The province is bordered by <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, <a href="Punjab%2C%20Pakistan">Punjab</a> and <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>, and <a href="Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a> and the <a href="Federally%20Administered%20Tribal%20Areas">Federally Administered Tribal Areas</a> to the north-east. To the south lies the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>. Balochistan is located on the south-eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It borders the geopolitical regions of the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. Balochistan lies at the mouth of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Hormuz">Strait of Hormuz</a> and provides the shortest route from seaports to Central Asia. Its geographical location has placed the otherwise desolate region in the scope of competing global interests for all of recorded history.

The capital city Quetta is located in a densely populated portion of the <a href="Sulaiman%20Mountains">Sulaiman Mountains</a> in the north-east of the province. It is situated in a river valley near the Bolan Pass, which has been used as the route of choice from the coast to Central Asia, entering through Afghanistan's <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> region. The British and other historic empires have crossed the region to invade Afghanistan by this route.

Balochistan is rich in exhaustible and renewable resources; it is the second major supplier of natural gas in Pakistan. The province's renewable and human resource potential has not been systematically measured or exploited due to pressures from within and without Pakistan. Local inhabitants have chosen to live in towns and have relied on sustainable water sources for thousands of years.

The climate of the upper highlands is characterised by very cold winters and hot summers. In the lower highlands, winters vary from extremely cold in northern districts <a href="Ziarat">Ziarat</a>, Quetta, Kalat, Muslim Baagh and Khanozai to milder conditions closer to the Makran coast. Winters are mild on the plains, with temperature never falling below freezing point. Summers are hot and dry, especially in the arid zones of Chagai and Kharan districts. The plains are also very hot in summer, with temperatures reaching .The record highest temperature, , was recorded in Sibi on 26 May 2010, exceeding the previous record, . Other hot areas include <a href="Turbat">Turbat</a> and <a href="Dalbandin">Dalbandin</a>. The desert climate is characterised by hot and very arid conditions. Occasionally, strong windstorms make these areas very inhospitable.

The economy of Balochistan is largely based upon the production of natural gas, coal and other minerals.

Balochistan has been called a "neglected province where a majority of population lacks amenities". Since the mid-1970s the province's share of Pakistan's GDP has dropped from 4.9 to 3.7%, and as of 2007 it had the highest poverty rate and infant and maternal mortality rate, and the lowest literacy rate in the country, factors some allege have contributed to the insurgency. However, in 7th NFC awards Punjab province and Federal contributed to increase Baluchistan share more than its entitled population based share. In Balochistan poverty is increasing. In 2001–2002 poverty incidences was at 48% and by 2005–2006 was at 50.9%.

Though the province remains largely underdeveloped, several major development projects, including the construction of a new deep sea port at the strategically important town of <a href="Gwadar">Gwadar</a>, are in progress in Balochistan. The port is projected to be the hub of an energy and trade corridor to and from China and the Central Asian republics. The <a href="Mirani%20Dam">Mirani Dam</a> on the <a href="Dasht%20River">Dasht River</a>, west of Turbat in the <a href="Makran%20Division">Makran Division</a>, is being built to provide water to expand agricultural land use by where it would otherwise be unsustainable. In the district Lasbela there is an oil refinery owned by Byco International Incorporated (BII), which is capable of processing 120,000 barrels of oil per day. A power station is located adjacent to the refinery. Several cement plants and a marble factory are also located there. One of the world's largest <a href="ship%20breaking">ship breaking</a> yards is located on the coast.

Balochistan's share of Pakistan's national income has historically ranged between 3.7% to 4.9%. Since 1972, Balochistan's gross income has grown in size by 2.7 times. Outside Quetta, the resource extraction infrastructure of the province is gradually developing but still lags far behind other parts of Pakistan.

The agreements for royalty rights and ownership of mineral rights were reached during a period of unprecedented natural disasters, economic, social, political, and cultural unrest in Pakistan. The negotiations were widely considered to be insufficiently transparent.

In common with the other provinces of Pakistan, Balochistan has a parliamentary form of government. The ceremonial head of the province is the <a href="Governor%20of%20Balochistan%20%28Pakistan%29">Governor</a>, who is appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20Pakistan">President of Pakistan</a> on the advice of the provincial <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20Balochistan">Chief Minister</a>. The Chief Minister, the province's chief executive, is normally the leader of the largest political party or alliance of parties in the provincial assembly.

The <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> <a href="Provincial%20Assembly%20of%20Balochistan">Provincial Assembly of Balochistan</a> comprises 65 seats of which 11 are reserved for women and 3 reserved for non-Muslims. The judicial branch of government is carried out by the <a href="Balochistan%20High%20Court">Balochistan High Court</a>, which is based in Quetta and headed by a Chief Justice.

Besides dominant Pakistan-wide political parties (such as the <a href="Pakistan%20Muslim%20League%20%28N%29">Pakistan Muslim League (N)</a> and the <a href="Pakistan%20Peoples%20Party">Pakistan Peoples Party</a>), Balochistan nationalist parties (such as the <a href="National%20Party%20%28Pakistan%29">National Party</a> and the <a href="Balochistan%20National%20Party">Balochistan National Party</a>) have been prominent in the province.

In order to implement Closed Border Policy, Frontier Corps was raised by British in 1870 to perform the border security duties along the Indo-Afghan Buffer Zone, having its HQ in Peshawar, NWFP. 5 Corps, i.e. Zhob Militia, Pishin Scouts, Chagai Militia, Kalat Scouts and Sibi Scouts were deployed in Balochistan as border security and internal security force. FC Balochistan was formally raised in Mar 1974, comprising seven units: 5 units in situ, 2 new units Maiwand Rifles, Mekran Scouts and 1 Training Center at Loralai. In 1977, 4 more units, Ghazaband Scouts, Loralai Scouts, Bhambore Rifles and Kharan Rifles were raised. In the wake of 9/11, Bolan Scouts was raised at Muslim Bagh along Pak- Afghan Border, bringing the total to 12 Corps. The additional raising was undertaken in year 2005–06 to further strengthen the security arrangements. In this package 2 x Sector Headquarters, 3 Corps and 4 x Mortar Batteries were raised. To meet the training requirements of this sizeable force, FC Battle School was raised at Beleli in year 2006. To cater for the growing requirement of complex border and Internal Security operations, on 1 July 2007, a Special Operations Wing (SOW), IAC Squadron and Tank Regiment were also raised from within own resources. Sui Rifles was raised in March 2011.

For administrative purposes, the province is divided into six Divisions – Kalat, Makran, Nasirabad, Quetta, Sibi and Zhob. This divisional level was abolished in 2000, but restored after the 2008 election. Each Division is under an appointed Commissioner. The six Divisions are further subdivided into 32 districts:
Note: In this map, Lehri is shown within Sibi District on #27. Sohbatpur is shown within Jafarabad District on #8.

Balochistan's population density is low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. In March 2012, preliminary census figures showed that the population of Balochistan had reached 13,162,222, not including the districts of Khuzdar, Kech and Panjgur, a 139.3% increase from 5,501,164 in 1998, representing 6.85% of Pakistan's total population. This was the largest increase in population by any province of Pakistan during that time period. Official estimates of Balochistan's population grew from approximately 7.45 million in 2003 to 7.8 million in 2005. According to the 1998 Census, Balochistan had a total population of 6,565,885 of which most (6,484,006) were <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s. There were also Hindu and Christian minorities in the province. The 1998 Census recorded that the <a href="Hinduism%20in%20Pakistan">Hindu</a> population in the province was approximately 39,000 (including the Scheduled Castes). There was also a <a href="Christianity%20in%20Pakistan">Christian</a> minority of 26,462 individuals in the province.

According to the Ethnologue, households whose primary language is Makrani constitutes 13%, Rukhshani 10%, and Sulemani 7% of the population. Pashto is also spoken by around 30% of the population and 13% of households speak Brahui. The remaining 18% of the population speaks various languages, including Lasi, Urdu, Punjabi, Hazargi, Sindhi, Saraiki, Dehvari, Dari, Tajik, Hindko, Uzbik, and Hindki.

In the <a href="Lasbela%20District">Lasbela District</a>, the majority of the population speaks <a href="Lasi">Lasi</a>.

The 2005 census concerning <a href="Afghans%20in%20Pakistan">Afghans in Pakistan</a> showed that a total of 769,268 Afghan refugees were temporarily staying in Balochistan. However, there are probably fewer Afghans living in Balochistan today as many refugees repatriated in 2013. As of 2015, there are only 327,778 registered Afghan refugees according to the UNHCR.

William M. Tweed

William Magear Tweed (April 3, 1823 – April 12, 1878)—often erroneously referred to as "William "Marcy" Tweed" (see <a href="%23Middle%20name">below</a>), and widely known as "Boss" Tweed—was an American <a href="politician">politician</a> most notable for being the "<a href="Political%20boss">boss</a>" of <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a>, the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a> <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> that played a major role in the <a href="politics">politics</a> of <a href="History%20of%20New%20York%20City%20%281855%E2%80%931897%29">19th century New York City</a> and <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">State</a>. At the height of his influence, Tweed was the third-largest landowner in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and a director of the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a>, the <a href="Tenth%20National%20Bank">Tenth National Bank</a>, and the New-York Printing Company, as well as proprietor of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Hotel%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Metropolitan Hotel</a>.

Tweed was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in 1852 and the New York County board of supervisors in 1858, the year he became the head of the Tammany Hall political machine. He was also elected to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Senate">New York State Senate</a> in 1867, but Tweed's greatest influence came from being an appointed member of a number of boards and commissions, his control over political <a href="patronage">patronage</a> in New York City through Tammany, and his ability to ensure the loyalty of voters through jobs he could create and dispense on city-related projects.

Tweed was convicted for stealing an amount estimated by an aldermen's committee in 1877 at between $25 million and $45 million from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> taxpayers through <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a>, although later estimates ranged as high as $200 million. Unable to make bail, he escaped from jail once, but was returned to custody. He died in the <a href="Ludlow%20Street%20Jail">Ludlow Street Jail</a>.

Tweed was born April 3, 1823, at 1 Cherry Street, on the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Son of a third-generation <a href="Ulster-Scots">Scots-Irish</a> chair-maker, Tweed grew up on <a href="Cherry%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Cherry Street</a>. Tweed's religious affiliation was not widely known in his lifetime, but at the time of his funeral the "New York Times", quoting a family friend, reported that his parents had been Quakers and "members of the old Rose Street Meeting house". At the age of 11, he left school to learn his father's trade, and then became an apprentice to a saddler. He also studied to be a <a href="bookkeeping">bookkeeper</a> and worked as a brushmaker for a company he had invested in, before eventually joining in the family business in 1852. On September 29, 1844, he married Mary Jane C. Skaden and lived with her family on Madison Street for two years.

Tweed became a member of the <a href="Odd%20Fellows">Odd Fellows</a> and the <a href="Freemasonry">Masons</a>, and joined a volunteer fire company, Engine No. 12. In 1848, at the invitation of state assemblyman John J. Reilly, he and some friends organized the Americus Fire Company No. 6, also known as the "Big Six", as a <a href="volunteer%20fireman">volunteer fire company</a>, which took as its symbol a snarling red <a href="Bengal%20tiger">Bengal tiger</a>, a symbol which remained associated with Tweed and <a href="Tammany%20Hall">Tammany Hall</a> for many years. At the time, volunteer fire companies competed vigorously with each other; some were connected with street gangs and had strong ethnic ties to various immigrant communities. The competition could be so fierce that buildings would sometimes burn down while the fire companies fought each other. Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew, but fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, and Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward, who put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26. He lost that election to the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> candidate <a href="Morgan%20Morgans">Morgan Morgans</a>, but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.

Tweed was elected to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished. In an attempt by Republican reformers in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>, the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up. The board had 12 members, six appointed by the mayor and six elected, and in 1858 Tweed was appointed to the board, which became his first vehicle for large-scale <a href="Graft%20%28politics%29">graft</a>; Tweed and other supervisors forced vendors to pay a 15% overcharge to their "ring" in order to do business with the city. By 1853, Tweed was running the seventh ward for Tammany.

Although he was not trained as a lawyer, Tweed's friend, Judge <a href="George%20G.%20Barnard">George G. Barnard</a>, certified him as an attorney, and Tweed opened a law office on Duane Street. He ran for <a href="New%20York%20City%20Sheriff%27s%20Office">sheriff</a> in 1861 and was defeated, but became the chairman of the Democratic General Committee shortly after the election, and was then chosen to be the head of Tammany's general committee in January 1863. Several months later, in April, he became "Grand Sachem", and began to be referred to as "Boss", especially after he tightened his hold on power by creating a small executive committee to run the club. Tweed then took steps to increase his income: he used his law firm to extort money, which was then disguised as legal services; he had himself appointed deputy street commissioner – a position with considerable access to city contractors and funding; he bought the New-York Printing Company, which became the city's official printer, and the city's stationery supplier, the Manufacturing Stationers' Company, and had both companies begin to overcharge for their goods and services. He also started to form what became known as the "Tweed Ring", by having his friends elected to office: George G. Barnard was elected <a href="Recorder%20of%20New%20York%20City">Recorder of New York City</a>; <a href="Peter%20B.%20Sweeny">Peter B. Sweeny</a> was elected <a href="New%20York%20County%20District%20Attorney">New York County District Attorney</a>; and <a href="Richard%20B.%20Connolly">Richard B. Connolly</a> was elected City Comptroller.

With his new position and wealth came a change in style: Tweed began to favor wearing a large diamond in his shirtfront – a habit that <a href="Thomas%20Nast">Thomas Nast</a> used to great effect in his attacks on Tweed in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" beginning in 1869 – and he bought a <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> to live in at 41 West 36th Street, then a very fashionable area. He invested his now considerable illegal income in real estate, so that by the late 1860s he ranked among the biggest landowners in New York City.

Tweed was a member of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Senate">New York State Senate</a> (4th D.) from 1868 to 1873, sitting in the <a href="91st%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">91st</a>, <a href="92nd%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">92nd</a>, <a href="93rd%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">93rd</a> and <a href="94th%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">94th New York State Legislature</a>s, but not taking his seat in the <a href="95th%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">95th</a> and <a href="96th%20New%20York%20State%20Legislature">96th New York State Legislature</a>s. In the Senate he helped financiers <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a> and <a href="Big%20Jim%20Fisk">Big Jim Fisk</a> to take control of the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a> from <a href="Cornelius%20Vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> by arranging for legislation that legitimized fake Erie stock certificates that Gould and Fisk had issued. In return, Tweed received a large block of stock and was made a director of the company.

After the election of 1869, Tweed took control of the New York City government. His protégé, <a href="John%20T.%20Hoffman">John T. Hoffman</a>, the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like <a href="Peter%20Cooper">Peter Cooper</a> and the <a href="Union%20League%20Club">Union League Club</a>, by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions. The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870. Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.

The new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor <a href="A.%20Oakey%20Hall">A. Oakey Hall</a> and Comptroller <a href="Richard%20B.%20Connolly">Richard "Slippery Dick" Connolly</a>, both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices — such as <a href="Peter%20B.%20Sweeny">Peter B. Sweeny</a>, who took over the Department of Public Parks — providing the Tweed Ring with even firmer control of the New York City government and enabling them to defraud the taxpayers of many more millions of dollars. In the words of <a href="Albert%20Bigelow%20Paine">Albert Bigelow Paine</a>, "their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar." Contractors working for the city – "Ring favorites, most of them – were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O. K.' and Connolly's endorsement, it was paid ... through a go-between, who cashed the check, settled the original bill and divided the remainder ... between Tweed, Sweeny, Connolly and Hall".

For example, the construction cost of the <a href="Tweed%20Courthouse">New York County Courthouse</a>, begun in 1861, grew to nearly $13 million—about $178 million in today's dollars, and nearly twice the cost of the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a> in 1867.
"A carpenter was paid $360,751 (roughly $4.9 million today) for one month's labor in a building with very little woodwork ... a plasterer got $133,187 ($1.82 million) for two days' work".

Tweed and his friends also garnered huge profits from the development of the Upper East Side, especially <a href="Yorkville%2C%20Manhattan">Yorkville</a> and <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area—for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the <a href="Croton%20Aqueduct">Croton Aqueduct</a>—thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits. The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the <a href="topography">topography</a> of which made it more expensive to improve. The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90 million.

During the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development. In order to ensure that the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a> project would go forward, State Senator <a href="Henry%20Cruse%20Murphy">Henry Cruse Murphy</a> approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor <a href="William%20C.%20Kingsley">William C. Kingsley</a> put up the cash, which was delivered in a <a href="carpet%20bag">carpet bag</a>. Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.

Tweed bought a mansion on <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> and <a href="43rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">43rd Street</a>, and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on <a href="40th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">40th Street</a>. By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company. He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.

Tweed's downfall came in the wake of the <a href="Orange%20riots">Orange riot of 1871</a>, which came after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism, because of a riot the year before in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders. Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from <a href="NYPD">city policemen</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20National%20Guard">state militia</a>. The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.

Although Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of their people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.

Tweed had for months been under attack from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and <a href="Thomas%20Nast">Thomas Nast</a>, the cartoonist from "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" – regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, "Stop them damned pictures. I don't care so much what the papers say about me. My constituents don't know how to read, but they can't help seeing them damned pictures!" – but their campaign had only limited success in gaining traction. They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor <a href="A.%20Oakey%20Hall">A. Oakey Hall</a>, a Tammany man, which included <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor%20III">John Jacob Astor III</a>, banker <a href="Moses%20Taylor">Moses Taylor</a> and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been "faithfully kept", letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.

The response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the "Times"/Nast campaign began to garner popular support. More important, the "Times" started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to <a href="blackmail">blackmail</a> Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a> to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the "Times". Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the "Times", which was reportedly offered $5 million to not publish the evidence. The "Times" also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined "Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed". In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.

The exposé provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts. European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management – only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities. New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.

Thus, the city's elite met at <a href="Cooper%20Union">Cooper Union</a> in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also <a href="History%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> bigwigs such as <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a>, who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the "wisest and best citizens" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as "the <a href="Committee%20of%20Seventy%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Committee of Seventy</a>"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge—Tweed's old friend George Barnard, no less—enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching to City Hall demanding to be paid. Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse—$50,000—but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.

Shortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing <a href="Andrew%20Haswell%20Green">Andrew Haswell Green</a>, an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.

Tweed was released on $1 million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box. Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas. Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader. Once again, he was released on <a href="bail">bail</a>—$8 million this time—but Tweed's supporters, such as <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a>, felt the repercussions of his fall from power.

Tweed's first trial, in January 1873, ended when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict. His retrial in November resulted in convictions on 204 of 220 counts, a fine of $12,750 (the equivalent of $ today) and a prison sentence of 12 years; a higher court, however, reduced Tweed's sentence to one year. After his release from prison, New York State filed a <a href="civil%20suit">civil suit</a> against Tweed, attempting to recover $6 million in embezzled funds. Unable to put up the $3 million bail, Tweed was locked up in the <a href="Ludlow%20Street%20Jail">Ludlow Street Jail</a>, although he was allowed home visits. On one of these, Tweed escaped and fled to <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, where he worked as a common seaman on a Spanish ship. The U.S. government discovered his whereabouts and arranged for his arrest once he reached the Spanish border; he was recognized from Nast's political cartoons. He was turned over to an American warship, the <a href="USS%20Franklin%20%281864%29">USS "Franklin"</a>, which delivered him to authorities in New York City on November 23, 1876, and he was returned to prison.

Desperate and broken, Tweed now agreed to testify about the inner workings of his corrupt Ring to a special committee set up by the Board of Aldermen, in return for his release, but after he did so, Tilden, now governor of New York, refused to abide by the agreement, and Tweed remained incarcerated. He died in the Ludlow Street Jail on April 12, 1878, from severe <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and was buried in the <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> <a href="Green-Wood%20Cemetery">Green-Wood Cemetery</a>. Mayor <a href="Smith%20Ely">Smith Ely</a> would not allow the flag at City Hall to be flown at <a href="Half-mast">half staff</a>.

According to Tweed biographer Kenneth D. Ackerman:It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.

In depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.

Although he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party, Tweed was never the sole "boss" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a> in terms of more efficient city management. Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a> in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a>, even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.

Tweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths. Tweed also fought for the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize <a href="Catholic%20schools">Catholic schools</a> and hospitals. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined. Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.

During Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between <a href="34th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">34th Street</a> and <a href="59th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">59th Street</a>, land was secured for the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, and the <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a> and <a href="Upper%20West%20Side">Upper West Side</a> were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure – all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.

According to Leo Hershkowitz in "Tweed's New York: Another Look", there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in "Harper's Weekly" and the editors of "The New York Times", which both had ties to the Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the <a href="Whiskey%20Ring">Whiskey Ring</a>.

Tweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: "Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come." One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become "the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss".

Tweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain "M.", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as "Marcy". His actual middle name was "Magear", his mother's maiden name; Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed, Jr. The confusion derives from a Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from <a href="William%20L.%20Marcy">William L. Marcy</a>, the former governor of New York.

In 1945 Boss Tweed was portrayed by <a href="Noah%20Beery%2C%20Sr.">Noah Beery, Sr.</a> in the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> production of "Up In Central Park", a <a href="musical%20comedy">musical comedy</a> with music by <a href="Sigmund%20Romberg">Sigmund Romberg</a>. The role was played by <a href="Malcolm%20Lee%20Beggs">Malcolm Lee Beggs</a> for a revival in 1947. In the <a href="Up%20in%20Central%20Park">1948 film version</a>, Tweed is played by <a href="Vincent%20Price">Vincent Price</a>.

On the 1963–1964 <a href="CBS">CBS</a> TV series "<a href="The%20Great%20Adventure%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Great Adventure</a>", which presented one-hour dramatizations of the lives of historical figures, <a href="Edward%20Andrews">Edward Andrews</a> portrayed Tweed in the episode "The Man Who Stole New York City", about the campaign by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" to bring down Tweed. The episode aired on December 13, 1963.

In <a href="John%20Varley%20%28author%29">John Varley</a>'s 1977 science-fiction novel, "<a href="The%20Ophiuchi%20Hotline">The Ophiuchi Hotline</a>", a crooked politician in a 27th-century human settlement on the Moon assumes the name "Boss Tweed" in emulation of the 19th-century politician, and names his lunar headquarters "Tammany Hall".

Tweed was played by <a href="Philip%20Bosco">Philip Bosco</a> in the 1986 <a href="TV%20movie">TV movie</a> "Liberty". According to a review of the film in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", it was Tweed who made the suggestion to call the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> by that name, instead of its formal name "Liberty Enlightening the World", in order to read better in newspaper headlines.

Andrew O'Hehir of "The New York Times" notes that "Forever", a 2003 novel by <a href="Pete%20Hamill">Pete Hamill</a>, and "<a href="Gangs%20of%20New%20York">Gangs of New York</a>", a 2002 film, both "offer a significant supporting role to the legendary Manhattan political godfather Boss Tweed", among other thematic similarities. In a review of the latter work, Chuck Rudolph praised <a href="Jim%20Broadbent">Jim Broadbent</a>'s portrayal of Tweed as "giving the role a masterfully heartless composure".

Tweed appears as an antagonist in the novel, "Assassin's Creed Last Descendants" where he is the Grand Master of the American Templars during the American Civil War.

Balsall Heath

Balsall Heath is a working class, <a href="inner-city">inner-city</a> area of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, West Midlands, England. It has a diverse cultural mix of people and is the location of the <a href="Balti%20Triangle">Balti Triangle</a>.

Balsall Heath was agricultural land between <a href="Moseley">Moseley</a> village and the city of Birmingham until the 1850s when expansion along Moseley Road joined the two. The area was originally part of the <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a> parish of <a href="King%27s%20Norton">King's Norton</a>, and was added to the <a href="county%20borough">county borough</a> of Birmingham in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> on 1 October 1891.

During negotiations in the previous year it had been promised a public baths and a free library. In 1895, the library was opened on Moseley Road and, in 1907, <a href="Public%20Library%20and%20Baths%2C%20Balsall%20Heath">Balsall Heath Baths</a> were opened in an adjoining building. 

In 1900, the city's <a href="College%20of%20Art%2C%20Balsall%20Heath">College of Art</a> was also opened on Moseley Road. By this time the small lake ("Lady Pool" on old maps) at the end of Ladypool Road had been filled in to create a park. 

Balsall Heath initially had a reasonably affluent population, which can still be seen in the dilapidated grandeur of some of the larger houses. A railway station on Brighton Road (on the Birmingham to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> line) led to further expansion, and the end of the 19th century saw a proliferation of high-density small <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a>s.

A <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> community was started in June 1940 when two <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>is purchased an artisan cottage on Mary Street. With the mosque being located in the area, more Muslim immigrants began to move into private lodgings in Balsall Heath. Today, Balsall Heath has one of the largest Muslim communities in Birmingham. It is also home to diverse communities from across the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>.

By the 1980s, many of Balsall Heath's houses were in a dilapidated condition; some still lacked bathrooms or indoor toilets. The local council considered demolishing these properties but chose to refurbish them as part of an <a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a> scheme. Most of these Victorian terraces still exist and, along with more modern <a href="social%20housing">social housing</a>, characterise the area today. The area's traditional 'brick' pavements were replaced at this time by the more modern and conventional paving slabs. 

Balsall Heath's low rents also attracted a <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> student population. Its proximity to the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>, the city centre and the "trendy" area of <a href="Moseley">Moseley</a> were all contributing factors. There was little conflict between the students and locals despite their vastly differing lifestyles. However, a knife-incident in 1991 led to an article in "<a href="Redbrick%20%28Newspaper%29">Redbrick</a>" warning students not to live in the area.

In July 2005, Balsall Heath was hit by a <a href="Birmingham%20Tornado%20%28UK%29">tornado</a>, which devastated many buildings around Church Road and Ladypool Road. Birmingham City Council offered loans to those who would otherwise be unable to repair their properties, and the area has now made a full recovery.

<a href="Street%20prostitution">Street prostitution</a> first appeared in Balsall Heath during the 1950s. Property values fell, attracting Birmingham's poorer migrants. By the 1970s, the area was notorious for <a href="robbery">street robberies</a> and <a href="drug%20dealing">drug dealing</a>. Cheddar Road was the centre of a red-light district worked by 450 women. About half of the 50 houses on this road had prostitutes advertising themselves in the windows, similar to <a href="De%20Wallen">Amsterdam</a>. It was labelled Britain's busiest cul-de-sac.

In 1986, an organisation called ANAWIM was formed by the <a href="Sisters%20of%20Charity">Sisters of Charity</a> to provide outreach support to the prostitutes. 

In September 1992, a report was published encouraging the formation of a zone of tolerance towards prostitution in Balsall Heath. This was opposed by residents and a local police inspector. In the following year Samo Paull, a woman working as a prostitute, was abducted from Balsall Heath and murdered. 

In 1994, residents began to organise street patrols forcing the prostitutes and street criminals out of the area. These patrols had the qualified support of the police but were regarded as <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a>s by some. There was an immediate two-thirds reduction in street and window prostitution. By November 1995, they had been almost completely eliminated.

The area has enjoyed a slow revival. House prices are now similar to those in other inner-city areas, while the crime rate is among the lowest.

Bunge &amp; Born

Bunge y Born was a <a href="multinational%20corporation">multinational corporation</a> based in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, whose diverse interests included <a href="food%20processing">food processing</a> and international trade in <a href="Cereal">grain</a>s and <a href="oilseed">oilseed</a>s. It is now known as <a href="Bunge%20Limited">Bunge Limited</a>.

Bunge & Born was founded in 1884 by Ernesto Bunge, a <a href="German%20Argentine">German Argentine</a> whose uncle, Carl Bunge, had been Consul General in Argentina for both the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and his brother-in-law, Jorge Born, who had recently arrived from <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>. The company superseded the Bunge Company founded in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> by Johann Bunge, in 1818. Following the purchase of of prime <a href="pampas">pampas</a> wheat fields, Bunge & Born established "Centenera", their first food processing plant, in 1899. They had one of the largest wheat mills in the country built on a <a href="Puerto%20Madero">Puerto Madero</a> lot in 1902, and with it, established "<a href="Molinos%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Molinos Río de la Plata</a>" (later a leader in the local retail foods market).

The company started Argentina's first <a href="burlap">burlap</a> bag manufacturer, following which they successfully lobbied government policy makers for <a href="protectionism">protective tariffs</a> on the then-critical commercial staple. They established a mortgage bank, the "Banco Hipotecario Franco Argentino", and a subsidiary in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> in 1905, and by 1910, they reportedly controlled 80% of Argentine cereal exports (Argentina was, by then, the world's third-largest grain exporter). They later established paint manufacturer "Alba" (1925), chemical and fertilizer maker "Compañía Química", and textile maker "Grafa" (1932), among others; by the late 1920s, the company's annual export receipts alone reached US$300 million. The company inaugurated its <a href="Neo-gothic%20architecture">neo-gothic</a> Buenos Aires headquarters on <a href="Leandro%20Alem%20Avenue">Leandro Alem Avenue</a>, designed by local architect Pablo Naeff, in 1926.

Bunge & Born's near-monopoly on cereal and flour exports ended with populist President <a href="Juan%20Per%C3%B3n">Juan Perón</a>'s 1946 establishment of the <a href="IAPI">IAPI</a>, a state agricultural purchasing and export agent. The company responded by extending its reach into the country fast-growing retail processed foods market, and though its prominence as the nation's chief exporter was partly restored by Perón's 1955 ousting and the IAPI's liquidation, its focus remained domestic over the next three decades. A privately held company, Bunge & Born did not release periodical financial statements, though it did report US$2bn in gross receipts in 1962; by then it had become a leader in <a href="commodity%20futures">commodity futures</a> trading, operating 110 offices worldwide.

The Bunge, Born, Hirsch, Engels and De La Tour families remained the company's chief stock-holders, and by extension, leaders in the domestic textile, paint, chemical, fertilizer, and food processing industries. On September 19, 1974, however, the consortium was shaken by the kidnapping of siblings Jorge and Juan Born by the far-left terrorist group, <a href="Montoneros">Montoneros</a>. The Born brothers were kept in a known <a href="SIDE">Argentine State Intelligence</a> safehouse for nine months until their June 1975 release, something made possible without public suspicion of outside involvement by the agency's numerous contacts inside the Montoneros (including the leader, Mario Firmenich). Freed for a US$60 million ransom (the largest on record at that time), the ordeal triggered the company headquarters' relocation to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, Brazil, and contributed to the <a href="March%201976%20coup">March 1976 coup</a>.

Retaining their Argentine interests (44 companies, by the 1980s), the families continued to suffer from ongoing disputes, and in 1987, CEO Mario Hirsch died suddenly. The election of <a href="Carlos%20Menem">Carlos Menem</a> to the Argentine Presidency in May 1989, however, resulted in an agreement between the President-elect and Jorge Born that gave the company partial control over national economic policy. Bunge & Born provided the Menem government with its first two economy ministers, and the combination of large rate increases on public services (around 500%), a simplified exchange rate and a massive, mandatory wage hike led to a sharp economic turnaround between July and November 1989. This foray into government policy making, however, ended in a new currency crisis that December and the failure (compounded by the company's lackluster business performance) resulted in Born's 1991 ouster from the board; he was replaced by Chief Operations Officer <a href="Octavio%20Caraballo">Octavio Caraballo</a>.

Beset by the rift between Jorge Born and his brother, Juan, the prior unity between the shareholders disintegrated as Caraballo struggled to modernize the company. Family frictions intensified when Jorge Born formed a business partnership with one of his former kidnappers, erstwhile Montonero strategist <a href="Rodolfo%20Galimberti">Rodolfo Galimberti</a>.

The company was converted into the <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>-registered <a href="Bunge%20International">Bunge International</a> in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international <a href="agribusiness">agribusiness</a> and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.

Big Apple

"Big Apple" is a nickname for <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. It was first popularized in the 1920s by <a href="John%20J.%20Fitz%20Gerald">John J. Fitz Gerald</a>, a sports writer for the "<a href="The%20Morning%20Telegraph">New York Morning Telegraph</a>". Its popularity since the 1970s is due in part to a promotional campaign by the New York tourist authorities.

Although the history of "Big Apple " was once thought a mystery, a clearer picture of the term's history has emerged due to the work of amateur etymologist <a href="Barry%20Popik">Barry Popik</a> and Gerald Cohen of <a href="Missouri%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Missouri University of Science and Technology</a>. A number of false theories had previously existed, including a claim that the term derived from a woman named Eve who ran a brothel in the city. This was subsequently exposed as a hoax.

The earliest known usage of 'big apple' appears in the book "The Wayfarer in New York" (1909), in which author Edward S. Martin writes: Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city... It inclines to think that the big apple gets a disproportionate share of the national sap. <a href="William%20Safire">William Safire</a> considered this the coinage, but the "Random House Dictionary of American Slang" has described the usage as "metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term".

"The Big Apple" was popularized as a name for New York City by <a href="John%20J.%20Fitz%20Gerald">John J. Fitz Gerald</a> in a number of horse-racing articles for the "New York Morning Telegraph" in the 1920s. The earliest of these was a casual reference on 3rd May, 1921:

Fitz Gerald referred to the "big apple" frequently thereafter. He explained his use in a column dated 18th February, 1924, under the headline "Around the Big Apple":

Fitz Gerald's reference to "dusky" stable hands suggests the term's origin may lie in <a href="African-American">African-American</a> culture. Evidence for this may be found in the "<a href="Chicago%20Defender">Chicago Defender</a>", an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. Writing for the "Defender" on 16th September 1922, “Ragtime” Billy Tucker used the name "big apple" to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context:

Tucker had also earlier used "big apple" as a reference to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. It is possible that he simply understood "big apple" as a nickname for any large city:

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use "Big Apple" and were using it in contexts other than horse-racing. "The Big Apple" was a popular song and <a href="Big%20Apple%20%28dance%29">dance</a> in the 1930s. <a href="Walter%20Winchell">Walter Winchell</a> and other writers continued to use the term in the 1940s and 1950s, but by the 1960s it had generally come to be known as an old name for New York.

In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC & Company, New York City's official marketing and tourism organization) began to promote the city's "Big Apple" nickname under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett. It has remained popular since then.

Mayor <a href="Rudolph%20W.%20Giuliani">Rudolph W. Giuliani</a> in 1997 signed legislation designating as "Big Apple Corner" the southwest corner of West <a href="54th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">54th Street</a> and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963. As part of the celebrations following as his election as President of the United States in 2016, <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> hosted a party which he named 'The Big Apple Ball' and which featured themed decorations and cut-outs of New York landmarks in honor of his home city.

Today the name enjoys exclusive ubiquity in literature and speech referring to New York City, and is used with regularity by journalists and news-headline writers across the English-speaking world.

The term "big apple" was used by <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> in conversation with opera singer <a href="Dorothy%20Kirsten">Dorothy Kirsten</a> on an episode of the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> radio program "Light Up Time" on 28th March, 1950.

In "<a href="Evita%20%28musical%29">Evita</a>", <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> is referred to as "B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple" in the song "Eva, Beware of the City." This line, produced by lyricist <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a>, does not appear to reflect any pre-existing usage.

The <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets baseball team</a> have featured a "Home Run Apple" that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>, and the original can still be seen on display at <a href="Citi%20Field">Citi Field</a>, outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citi Field now uses a new apple, one that is much larger than original.

Uses of the term abound elsewhere in the names of cultural products and events in or concerning New York, including the <a href="Big%20Apple%20Anime%20Fest">Big Apple Anime Fest</a>, the Big Apple Theater Festival, Jess Teong's <a href="The%20Kid%20from%20the%20Big%20Apple">The Kid from the Big Apple</a> and Kajagoogoo's <a href="Big%20Apple%20%28song%29">Big Apple</a>, and playful uses of the nickname have been seen, such as Patrick Downey's 2008 historical study of New York City's criminal underworld, entitled "Bad Seeds in the Big Apple."

Boston Corbett

Thomas P. "Boston" Corbett (January 29, 1832 – <a href="Declared%20death%20in%20absentia">presumed dead</a> <a href="Circa">c.</a> September 1, 1894) was a <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union Army</a> soldier who shot and killed President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassin</a>, <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.

Known for his devout religious beliefs and eccentric behavior, Corbett drifted around the United States before disappearing around 1888. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he died in the <a href="Great%20Hinckley%20Fire">Great Hinckley Fire</a> in September 1894, although this remains impossible to substantiate.

Corbett was born in <a href="London">London</a> and immigrated with his family to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 1839. The Corbetts moved frequently before eventually settling in <a href="Troy%2C%20New%20York">Troy, New York</a>. As a young man, Corbett began apprenticing as a <a href="hatter">hatter</a>, a profession that he would hold intermittently throughout his life. As a hatter, Corbett was regularly exposed to the fumes of <a href="mercury%28II%29%20nitrate">mercury(II) nitrate</a>, then used in the treatment of <a href="fur">fur</a> to produce <a href="felt">felt</a> used on hats. Excessive exposure to the compound can lead to <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s, <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> and twitching (known as the "hatter's shakes"). Historians have theorized that the mental issues Corbett exhibited before and after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> may have been caused by this exposure.

After working as a hatter in Troy, Corbett returned to New York City. He later married, but his wife and child died in childbirth. Following their deaths, he moved to <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. Corbett became despondent over the loss of his wife and child and began drinking heavily. He was unable to hold a job and eventually became homeless. After a night of heavy drinking, he was confronted by a street preacher whose message persuaded him to join the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. Corbett immediately stopped drinking and became devoutly religious. After being <a href="baptized">baptized</a>, he subsequently changed his name to Boston, the name of the city where he was converted. He regularly attended meetings at the Fulton and Bromfield Street churches where his enthusiastic behavior earned him the nickname "The Glory to God man". In an attempt to imitate <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, Corbett began to wear his hair very long (he was forced to cut it upon enlisting in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>).

In 1857, Corbett began working at a hat manufacturer's shop on <a href="Washington%20Street%20%28Boston%29">Washington Street</a> in downtown Boston. He was reported to be a proficient hatter, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence. He also began working as a <a href="street%20preacher">street preacher</a> and would sermonize and distribute religious literature in <a href="North%20Square%20%28Boston%2C%20Massachusetts%29">North Square</a>. Corbett soon earned a reputation around Boston for being a "local eccentric" and religious fanatic. On July 16, 1858, Corbett was propositioned by two <a href="prostitution">prostitutes</a> while walking home from a church meeting. He was deeply disturbed by the encounter. Upon returning to his room at a boardinghouse, Corbett began reading in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> ("And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee...and there be <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake"). In order to avoid sexual temptation and remain holy, he <a href="castration">castrated</a> <a href="self-surgery">himself</a> with a pair of scissors. He then ate a meal and went to a prayer meeting before seeking medical treatment.

In April 1861, early in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Corbett enlisted as a private in Company I of the 12th Regiment <a href="New%20York%20Militia">New York Militia</a>. Corbett's eccentric behavior quickly got him into trouble. He carried a bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers. Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of <a href="Religious%20texts">God's word</a>. In one instance, he verbally reprimanded <a href="Daniel%20Butterfield">Colonel Daniel Butterfield</a> for using profanity and taking the Lord's name in vain. He was sent to the <a href="guardhouse">guardhouse</a> for several days but refused to apologize for his insubordination. Due to his continued disruptive behavior and refusal to take orders, Corbett was <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed and sentenced to be shot. His sentence was eventually reduced and he was discharged in August 1863.

Corbett re-enlisted later that month as a private in Company L, <a href="16th%20Regiment%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Cavalry">16th New York Cavalry Regiment</a>. On June 24, 1864, he was captured by <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> Colonel <a href="John%20S.%20Mosby">John S. Mosby</a>'s men in <a href="Culpeper%2C%20Virginia">Culpeper, Virginia</a> and held prisoner at <a href="Andersonville%20prison">Andersonville prison</a> for five months. He was released in an <a href="Prisoner%20exchange">exchange</a> in November 1864 and was admitted to the Army hospital in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a> where he was treated for <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> and exposure. On his return to his company, he was promoted to <a href="Sergeant%20%28United%20States%29">Sergeant</a>. Corbett later testified for the prosecution in the trial of the commandant of Andersonville, Captain <a href="Henry%20Wirz">Henry Wirz</a>.

On April 24, 1865, <a href="16th%20Regiment%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Cavalry">Corbett's regiment</a> was sent to apprehend <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>, the assassin of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, whom Booth <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">fatally shot</a> on April 14, 1865. On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, <a href="David%20Herold">David Herold</a>, in a tobacco barn on the <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> farm of Richard Garrett. Herold surrendered, but Booth refused. The barn was set on fire in an attempt to force him out into the open, but Booth remained inside. Corbett was positioned near a large crack in the barn wall. In an 1878 interview, Corbett claimed that he saw Booth aim his <a href="carbine">carbine</a>, prompting him to shoot Booth with his <a href="Colt%20revolver">Colt revolver</a> despite <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a>'s orders that Booth should be captured alive. Lieutenant <a href="Edward%20P.%20Doherty">Edward P. Doherty</a>, the officer in charge of the soldiers who captured Booth and Herold, stated that "the bullet struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where his shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln." Booth's <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> was severed, and he died two hours later.

<a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lt. Colonel</a> <a href="Everton%20Conger">Everton Conger</a> initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter. When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, "<a href="Divine%20providence">Providence</a> directed me". He was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He stated, "...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right." Stanton paused and then stated, "The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot." Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to <a href="Mathew%20Brady">Mathew Brady</a>'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:

I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him...I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the bullet had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: "What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln."

Eyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was captured, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.

While there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, "live as one of the World's great avengers." For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 (). His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 (). Corbett received offers to purchase the gun he used to shoot Booth. He refused stating, "That is not mine-it belongs to the Government, and I would not sell it for any price." Corbett also declined an offer for one of Booth's pistols as he did not want a reminder of shooting Booth.

After his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter in Boston and frequently attended the Broomfield Street Church. When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to <a href="Danbury%2C%20Connecticut">Danbury, Connecticut</a> to continue his work and also "preached in the country round about." By 1870, he had relocated once again to <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a> where he was known as a "Methodist lay preacher". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers. In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as "Lincoln's Avenger". He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated <a href="lantern%20slide">lantern slide</a>s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.

R.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed "men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs. Corbett's paranoia was furthered by <a href="hate%20mail">hate mail</a> he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that "Booth's Avengers" or organizations like the "Secret Order" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.

While attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in <a href="Caldwell%2C%20Ohio">Caldwell, Ohio</a> in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it. In 1878, Corbett moved to <a href="Concordia%2C%20Kansas">Concordia, Kansas</a> where he acquired a plot of land through <a href="Homestead%20principle">homesteading</a> upon which he constructed a <a href="Dugout%20%28shelter%29">dugout</a> home. He continued working as a preacher and attended <a href="revival%20meeting">revival meeting</a>s frequently.

Due to his fame as "Lincoln's Avenger", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the <a href="Kansas%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kansas House of Representatives</a> in <a href="Topeka">Topeka</a> in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that 
officers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the <a href="Topeka%20State%20Hospital">Topeka Asylum for the Insane</a>. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback. He then rode to <a href="Neodesha%2C%20Kansas">Neodesha, Kansas</a> where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.

Rather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near <a href="Hinckley%2C%20Minnesota">Hinckley</a>, in <a href="Pine%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Pine County</a> in eastern <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. He is believed to have died in the <a href="Great%20Hinckley%20Fire">Great Hinckley Fire</a> on September 1, 1894. Although there is no proof, the name "Thomas Corbett" appears on the list of dead and missing.

In the years following Corbett's presumed death, several men came forwarding claiming to be "Lincoln's Avenger". A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a <a href="patent%20medicine">patent medicine</a> salesman in <a href="Enid%2C%20Oklahoma">Enid, Oklahoma</a> filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the <a href="St.%20Elizabeths%20Hospital">Government Hospital for the Insane</a>.

In 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of <a href="Concordia%2C%20Kansas">Concordia, Kansas</a>, built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road. A small sign was also placed to mark the dug hole where Corbett had lived for a time.

Character actor <a href="Dabbs%20Greer">Dabbs Greer</a> portrayed a fictional version of Corbett in "The Unmasked", a 1962 episode of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">western</a> series "<a href="Lawman%20%28TV%20series%29">Lawman</a>".

Corbett appears as a prominent and possibly prophetic character in Edward M. Erdelac's 2015 alternate historical horror novel "Andersonville".

Berber languages

The Berber languages, also known as Berber or the Amazigh languages (Berber name: , , ), are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects spoken by the <a href="Berbers">Berbers</a> indigenous to <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>. The Berber languages constitute a branch of the <a href="Afroasiatic%20family">Afroasiatic family</a>. They were traditionally written with the ancient Libyco-Berber script, which now exists in the form of <a href="Tifinagh">Tifinagh</a>.

Berber is spoken by large populations of <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="Libya">Libya</a> and by smaller populations of <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, northern <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, western and northern <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, northern <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> and in the <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Large Berber-speaking migrant communities, today numbering about 4 million, have been living in Western Europe, spanning over three generations, since the 1950s. The number of Berber people is much higher than the number of Berber speakers. The bulk of the populations of the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> countries are considered to have Berber ancestors. In Algeria, for example, a majority of the population consists of <a href="Arabised%20Berbers">Arabised Berbers</a>.

Around 90% of the Berber-speaking population speak one of six major varieties of Berber, each with at least two million speakers. They are, in order of number of speakers: <a href="Shilha%20language">Shilha</a> ("Tacelḥit/Tasussit"), <a href="Kabyle%20language">Kabyle</a> ("Taqbaylit"), <a href="Central%20Atlas%20Tamazight">Central Atlas Tamazight</a> ("Tamaziɣt"), <a href="Riffian%20language">Riffian</a> ("Tmaziɣt"), <a href="Shawiya%20language">Shawiya</a> ("Tacawit") and <a href="Tuareg%20languages">Tuareg</a> ("Tamaceq/Tamajaq/Tamahaq"). The extinct <a href="Guanche%20language">Guanche language</a> spoken on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> by the <a href="Guanches">Guanches</a>, as well as the languages of the ancient <a href="C-Group%20culture">C-Group culture</a> in present-day southern Egypt and northern <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>, are believed to have belonged to the Berber branch of the Afroasiatic family.

The Berber languages and dialects have had a written tradition, on and off, for about 2,500 years, although the tradition has been frequently disrupted by cultural shifts and invasions. They were first written in the Libyco-Berber <a href="abjad">abjad</a>, still used today by the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> in the form of Tuareg <a href="Tifinagh">Tifinagh</a>. The oldest dated inscription is from 3rd century BCE. Later, between about 1000 CE and 1500 CE, they were written in the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a>, and since the 20th century they have been written in the <a href="Berber%20Latin%20alphabet">Berber Latin alphabet</a>, especially among the <a href="Kabyle%20people">Kabyle</a> and <a href="Riffian%20people">Riffian</a> communities of Morocco and Algeria. The Berber Latin alphabet was also used by most European and Berber linguists during the 19th and 20th centuries.

A modernised form of the <a href="Tifinagh">Tifinagh</a> alphabet, called <a href="Neo-Tifinagh">Neo-Tifinagh</a>, was adopted in Morocco in 2003 for writing Berber, but many Moroccan Berber publications still use the <a href="Berber%20Latin%20alphabet">Berber Latin alphabet</a>. Algerians mostly use the Berber Latin alphabet in Berber language education at public schools, while Tifinagh is mostly used for artistic symbolism. Mali and Niger recognise a <a href="Berber%20Latin%20alphabet">Tuareg-Berber Latin alphabet</a> customised to the Tuareg phonological system. However, traditional Tifinagh is still used in those countries.

There is a cultural and political movement among speakers of the closely related varieties of Northern Berber to promote and unify them under a written <a href="standard%20language">standard language</a> called "Tamaziɣt". The name "Tamaziɣt" (or "Tamazight") is the current native name of the Berber language in the Moroccan <a href="Middle%20Atlas">Middle Atlas</a> region, the <a href="Rif">Rif</a> regions and the Libyan <a href="Zuwarah">Zuwarah</a> region. In other Berber-speaking areas this name was lost. There is historical evidence from medieval Berber manuscripts that all indigenous North Africans from Libya to Morocco have at some point called their language "Tamaziɣt". The name "Tamaziɣt" is currently being used increasingly by educated Berbers to refer to the written Berber language, and even to Berber as a whole, including Tuareg.

In 2001, Berber became a constitutional <a href="national%20language">national language</a> of Algeria, and in 2011 Berber became a constitutionally <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of Morocco. In 2016 Berber became a constitutionally official language of Algeria, after years of persecution.

The term "Berber" has been used in Europe since at least the 17th century, and is still used today. It was borrowed from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Barbari". The Latin word is also found in the Arabic designation for these populations, البربر ("al-Barbar"), see <a href="names%20of%20the%20Berber%20people">names of the Berber people</a>.

Etymologically, the Berber root "M-Z-Ɣ" ("Mazigh") (singular noun: "Amazigh", feminine: "Tamazight") means "free man", "noble man", or "defender". The feminine "Tamazight" traditionally referred specifically to the <a href="Riffian%20language">Riffian</a> and <a href="Central%20Atlas%20Tamazight">Central Atlas Tamazight</a> languages. Many Berber linguists prefer to consider the term "Tamazight" as a pure Berber word to be used only in Berber text while using the European word "Berber/"Berbero"/"Berbère"" in European texts to follow the traditions of European writings about the Berbers. European languages distinguish between the words "Berber" and "<a href="Barbarian%23Berber%20and%20North%20African%20cultures">barbarian</a>", while Arabic has the same word "al-Barbari" for both meanings.

Some other Berber writers, especially in Morocco, prefer to refer to Berber with "Amazigh" when writing about it in French or English.

Traditionally, the term "Tamazight" (in various forms: "Thamazighth", "Tamasheq", "Tamajaq", "Tamahaq") was used by many Berber groups to refer to the language they spoke, including the <a href="Central%20Atlas%20Tamazight">Middle Atlas</a>, the <a href="Riffian%20people">Riffians</a>, the <a href="Sened%20language">Sened</a> in Tunisia and the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a>. However, other terms were used by other groups; for instance, some Berber populations of Algeria called their language "Taznatit" (<a href="Zenata">Zenati</a>) or "Shelha", while the <a href="Kabyle%20people">Kabyle</a>s called theirs "Taqbaylit", and the inhabitants of the <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa Oasis</a> called their language "Siwi". In Tunisia, the local Amazigh language is usually referred to as "Shelha", a term which has been observed in Morocco as well.

One group, the <a href="Linguasphere%20Observatory">Linguasphere Observatory</a>, has attempted to introduce the <a href="neologism">neologism</a> "Tamazic languages" to refer to the Berber languages.

Berber is a member of the Afroasiatic language family, and its script is mainly rooted from the <a href="Ancient%20South%20Arabian%20script">Ancient south Arabian letters</a>. Since modern Berber languages are relatively homogeneous, the date of the <a href="Proto-Berber%20language">Proto-Berber language</a> from which the modern group is derived was probably comparatively recent, comparable to the age of the <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> or <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance</a> subfamilies. In contrast, the split of the group from the other Afro-Asiatic sub-phyla is much earlier, and is sometimes associated with the Mesolithic <a href="Capsian%20culture">Capsian culture</a>.

Various orthographies have been used to transcribe the Berber languages. In antiquity, the Libyco-Berber script (<a href="Tifinagh">Tifinagh</a>) was utilised to write Berber. Early uses of the script have been found on <a href="rock%20art">rock art</a> and in various <a href="sepulchre">sepulchre</a>s. Among these are the 1,500 year old <a href="Tin%20Hinan%20tomb">monumental tomb</a> of the Tuareg matriarch <a href="Tin%20Hinan">Tin Hinan</a>, where vestiges of a Tifinagh inscription have been found on one of its walls.

Following the spread of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, some Berber scholars also utilised the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a>. There are now three writing systems in use for Berber languages: Tifinagh, the Arabic script, and the <a href="Berber%20Latin%20alphabet">Berber Latin alphabet</a>.

After independence, all the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> countries to varying degrees pursued a policy of <a href="Arabization">Arabisation</a>, aimed partly at displacing French from its colonial position as the dominant language of education and literacy. Under this policy the use of the Amazigh/Berber languages was suppressed or even banned. This state of affairs has been contested by Berbers in Morocco and Algeria—especially <a href="Kabylie">Kabylie</a>—and was addressed in both countries by introducing the Berber language in some schools and by recognising Berber as a "<a href="national%20language">national language</a>" in Algeria, though not as an <a href="official%20language">official</a> one.

The 2011 constitution of Morocco makes "Amazigh" an official language alongside Arabic. Morocco is a country with several competing linguistically different languages, including French, <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a>, <a href="Moroccan%20Darija">Moroccan Arabic</a> and Amazigh. As the higher status of Modern Standard Arabic grew, so did the relation between the male population and the language, as well as the female population and the lower status language Amazigh. Women became the main carriers of the Amazigh language as the lower-status language in the country. In Mali and Niger, there are a few schools that teach partially in <a href="Tuareg%20languages">Tuareg languages</a>.

Although regional councils in Libya's <a href="Nafusa%20Mountains">Nafusa Mountains</a> affiliated with the <a href="National%20Transitional%20Council">National Transitional Council</a> reportedly use the Berber language of <a href="Nafusi%20language">Nafusi</a> and have called for it to be granted co-official status with Arabic in a prospective new constitution, Algeria and Morocco are the only countries where Tamazight is an <a href="official%20language">official language</a>.

As areas of Libya south and west of <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> such as the Nafusa Mountains were taken from the control of <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a> government forces in early summer 2011, Berber workshops and exhibitions sprang up to share and spread the Tamazight culture and language.

On 17 June 2011 King <a href="Mohammed%20VI%20of%20Morocco">Mohammed VI</a> announced in a speech of new constitutional reform that "Tamazight" became an official language of Morocco alongside Arabic and will be used in all the administrations in the future.

On 30 April 2012 Fatima Chahou, alias "Tabaamrant", member of the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Morocco%29">Moroccan House of Representatives</a> and former singer became the first person to <a href="Question%20time">ask questions</a> and discuss the minister's answer in Tamazight inside the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Morocco">Parliament of Morocco</a>.

On 7 February 2016 the Algerian parliament recognised Berber languages as having official status along with Arabic.

The exact population of Berber speakers is hard to ascertain, since most North African countries do not record language data in their censuses. <a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> provides a useful academic starting point; however, its bibliographic references are very inadequate, and it rates its own accuracy at only B-C for the area. Early colonial censuses may provide better documented figures for some countries; however, these are also very much out of date.


A survey included in the official <a href="2004%20Moroccan%20census">Moroccan census of 2004</a> and published by several Moroccan newspapers gave the following figures: 34 percent of people in rural regions spoke a Berber language and 21 percent in urban zones did; the national average would be 28.4 percent or 8.52 million. It is possible, however, that the survey asked for the language "used in daily life", which would result in figures lower than those of native speakers, as the language is not recognised for official purposes and many Berbers who live in an Arabic-speaking environment cannot use it in daily life; also, the use of Berber in public was frowned upon until the 1990s, which may have affected the result of the survey.

Adding up the population (according to the official census of 2004) of the Berber-speaking regions as shown on a 1973 map from the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> results in at least 10 million speakers, not counting the numerous Berber population which lives outside these regions in the bigger cities.

Moroccan linguist <a href="Mohamed%20Chafik">Mohamed Chafik</a> claims that 80 percent of <a href="Demographics%20of%20Morocco">Moroccans</a> are Berbers. It is not clear, however, whether he means "speakers of Berber languages" or "people of Berber descent".

The division of Moroccan Berber languages into three groups, as used by Ethnologue, is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by the presence of local differences: Shilha is subdivided into Shilha of the <a href="Draa%20River">Draa River</a> valley, Tasusit (the language of the <a href="Sous">Sous</a>s) and several other mountain languages. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain languages cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the central and eastern <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas</a> area) or Shilha.

Other Berber languages spoken in Algeria include: the Tamazight of <a href="Blida">Blida</a>, the languages of the <a href="Beni%20Snous">Beni Snous</a>s and <a href="Beni%20Boussaid">Beni Boussaid</a> villages in the province of <a href="Tlemcen%20Province">Tlemcen</a>, the <a href="Matmata%20Berber">Matmata Berber</a> spoken in the <a href="Ouarsenis">Ouarsenis</a> region, the <a href="Mozabite%20language">Mozabite language</a> spoken in the region of the province of Mzab and the language of the <a href="Ouargla">Ouargla</a> oasis.

Thus, the total number of speakers of Berber languages in the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> proper appears to lie anywhere between 16 and 25 million, depending on which estimate is accepted; if we take Basset's estimate, it could be as high as 30 million. The vast majority are concentrated in Morocco and Algeria. The Tuareg of the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> adds another million or so to the total.

<a href="Noun">Noun</a>s in the Berber languages vary in <a href="Grammatical%20gender">gender</a> (masculine versus feminine), <a href="Grammatical%20number">number</a> (singular versus plural) and <a href="Grammatical%20state">state</a> (free state versus <a href="construct%20state">construct state</a>). In the case of the masculine, nouns generally begin with one of the three vowels of Berber, "a", "u" or "i" (in standardised orthography, "e" represents a <a href="schwa">schwa</a> inserted for reasons of pronunciation):

While the masculine is unmarked, the feminine (also used to form <a href="diminutive">diminutive</a>s and <a href="singulative">singulative</a>s, like an ear of wheat) is marked with the <a href="circumfix">circumfix</a> "t...t". Feminine plural takes a prefix "t...":

Berber languages have two types of <a href="Grammatical%20number">number</a>: singular and <a href="plural">plural</a>, of which only the latter is marked. Plural has three forms according to the type of nouns. The first, "regular" type is known as the "external plural"; it consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a <a href="suffix">suffix</a> "-n":
The second form of the plural is known as the "broken plural". It involves only a change in the vowels of the word:
The third type of plural is a mixed form: it combines a change of vowels with the suffix "-n":

Berber languages also have two types of states or <a href="grammatical%20case">cases</a> of the <a href="noun">noun</a>, organized <a href="Ergative%20case">ergatively</a>: one is unmarked, while the other serves for the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called "free state", the latter "construct state". The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:
The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel "a" becomes "u":
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel, in the case of some feminine nouns:
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel ("w" or "y") word-initially:
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:

The following table gives the forms for the noun "amghar" "old man / leader":

Berber pronouns show gender distinction in the second- and third-persons, but in verbal agreement markers, the distinction is lost in the second-person.

A listing of the other Berber languages is complicated by their closeness; there is little distinction between language and dialect. The primary difficulty of subclassification, however, lies in the eastern Berber languages, where there is little agreement. Otherwise there is consensus on the outlines of the family:

The various classifications differ primarily in what they consider to be Eastern Berber, and in how many varieties they recognise as distinct languages.

There is so little data available on <a href="Guanche%20language">Guanche</a> that any classification is necessarily uncertain; however, it is almost universally acknowledged as Afro-Asiatic on the basis of the surviving glosses, and widely suspected to be Berber. Much the same can be said of the language, sometimes called "<a href="Numidian%20language">Numidian</a>", used in the Libyan or Libyco-Berber inscriptions around the turn of the Common Era, whose alphabet is the ancestor of <a href="Tifinagh">Tifinagh</a>.

<a href="Maarten%20Kossmann">Maarten Kossmann</a> (1999) describes Berber as two <a href="dialect%20continuum">dialect continua</a>,
plus a few peripheral languages, spoken in isolated pockets largely surrounded by Arabic, that fall outside these continua, namely
Within Northern Berber, however, he recognises a break in the continuum between <a href="Zenati%20languages">Zenati</a> and their non-Zenati neighbours; and in the east, he recognises a division between <a href="Ghadam%C3%A8s%20language">Ghadamès</a> and <a href="Awjila%20language">Awjila</a> on the one hand and <a href="Sokna%20language">Sokna</a> (<a href="Fuqaha%2C%20Libya">Fuqaha, Libya</a>), <a href="Siwa%20language">Siwa</a> and <a href="Nafusi%20language">Djebel Nefusa</a> on the other. The implied tree is:

<a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a>, mostly following <a href="Alexandra%20Aikhenvald">Aikhenvald</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Militarev">Militarev</a> (1991), treats the eastern varieties differently:

<a href="Roger%20Blench">Blench</a> (ms, 2006) has the following classification:

and within Berber,

The Berber languages have influenced <a href="Maghrebi%20Arabic">Maghrebi Arabic</a> languages, such as Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian Arabic. Their influence is also seen in some languages in West Africa. F. W. H. Migeod pointed to strong resemblances between Berber and <a href="Hausa%20language">Hausa</a> in such words and phrases as these: Berber: obanis; Hausa "obansa" (his father); Berber: a bat; Hausa "ya bata" (he was lost); Berber: eghare; Hausa "ya kirra" (he called). In addition he notes that the genitive in both languages is formed with n = "of".

A number of extinct populations are believed to have spoken Afro-Asiatic languages of the Berber branch. According to Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000), linguistic evidence suggests that the peoples of the <a href="C-Group%20culture">C-Group culture</a> in present-day southern <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and northern <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> spoke Berber languages. The <a href="Nilo-Saharan%20languages">Nilo-Saharan</a> <a href="Nobiin%20language">Nobiin language</a> today contains a number of key pastoralism related <a href="loanword">loanword</a>s that are of Berber origin, including the terms for sheep and water/<a href="Nile">Nile</a>. This in turn suggests that the C-Group population — which, along with the <a href="Kerma%20Culture">Kerma culture</a>, inhabited the Nile valley immediately before the arrival of the first <a href="Nubian%20languages">Nubian</a> speakers — spoke Afro-Asiatic languages.

Additionally, historical linguistics indicate that the <a href="Guanche%20language">Guanche language</a>, which was spoken on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> by the ancient <a href="Guanches">Guanches</a>, likely belonged to the Berber branch of the Afro-Asiatic family.

The Berber letter "c" is pronounced (like the English "sh").

The Berber letter "x" is pronounced (like the Spanish "j" or the German "ch").

The Berber letter "ɣ" is pronounced (like the French or German "r").

Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a legal status of a person or <a href="legal%20person">other entity</a> that cannot repay debts to <a href="creditor">creditor</a>s. In most jurisdictions, bankruptcy is imposed by a <a href="court%20order">court order</a>, often initiated by the <a href="debtor">debtor</a>.

Bankruptcy is not the only legal status that an insolvent person may have, and the term "bankruptcy" is therefore not a synonym for <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a>. In some countries, such as the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, bankruptcy is limited to individuals, and other forms of insolvency proceedings (such as <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> and <a href="Administration%20%28law%29">administration</a>) are applied to companies. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, "bankruptcy" is applied more broadly to formal insolvency proceedings. In France, the cognate French word "banqueroute" is used solely for cases of fraudulent bankruptcy, whereas the term "faillite" (cognate of "failure") is used for bankruptcy in accordance with the law.

The word "bankruptcy" is derived from Italian "banca rotta", meaning "broken bank", which may stem from a widespread custom in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Republic of Genoa</a> of breaking a moneychanger's bench or counter to signify his insolvency, or which may be only a figure of speech.

In <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into "<a href="debt%20slavery">debt slavery</a>", until the creditor recouped losses through their <a href="Manual%20labour">physical labour</a>. Many <a href="Polis">city-states</a> in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years; debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that <a href="Time%20limit">deadline</a> by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. An exception to this rule was <a href="Ancient%20Athens">Athens</a>, which by the <a href="Solonian%20Constitution">laws</a> of <a href="Solon">Solon</a> forbade enslavement for debt; as a consequence, most Athenian slaves were foreigners (Greek or otherwise).

The <a href="Statute%20of%20Bankrupts%20Act%201542">Statute of Bankrupts</a> of 1542 was the first statute under <a href="English%20law">English law</a> dealing with bankruptcy or <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a>. Bankruptcy is also documented in <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>. According to <a href="al-Maqrizi">al-Maqrizi</a>, the <a href="Yassa">Yassa</a> of <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> contained a provision that mandated the <a href="Capital%20punishment">death penalty</a> for anyone who became bankrupt three times.

A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> had to declare four <a href="sovereign%20default">state bankruptcies</a> in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. According to Kenneth S. Rogoff, "Although the development of international capital markets was quite limited prior to 1800, we nevertheless catalog the various defaults of France, Portugal, Prussia, Spain, and the early Italian city-states. At the edge of Europe, Egypt, Russia, and Turkey have histories of chronic default as well."

The principal focus of modern insolvency legislation and business <a href="debt%20restructuring">debt restructuring</a> practices no longer rests on the elimination of insolvent entities, but on the remodeling of the financial and organizational structure of debtors experiencing <a href="financial%20distress">financial distress</a> so as to permit the rehabilitation and continuation of the business.

For private households, some argue that it is insufficient to merely dismiss debts after a certain period . It is important to assess the underlying problems and to minimize the risk of financial distress to re-occur. It has been stressed that debt advice, a supervised rehabilitation period, financial education and social help to find sources of income and to improve the management of household expenditures must be equally provided during this period of rehabilitation (Refiner "et al.", 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). In most EU Member States, debt discharge is conditioned by a partial payment obligation and by a number of requirements concerning the debtor's behavior. In the United States (US), discharge is conditioned to a lesser extent. The spectrum is broad in the EU, with the UK coming closest to the US system (Reifner et al., 2003; Gerhardt, 2009; Frade, 2010). The Other Member States do not provide the option of a debt discharge. Spain, for example, passed a bankruptcy law ("ley concurs") in 2003 which provides for debt settlement plans that can result in a reduction of the debt (maximally half of the amount) or an extension of the payment period of maximally five years (Gerhardt, 2009), but it does not foresee debt discharge.

In the US, it is almost impossible to discharge student loan debt by filing bankruptcy. Unlike most other debtors, the individual with student debt must give a series of reasons and tests (with steps) to prove that the debtor could not pay the debt. If the person were to file bankruptcy, he or she is normally encouraged to do so under Chapter 13.

A person in financial straits can sometimes avoid bankruptcy by negotiating with the lender for lower monthly payments, or could seek debt consolidation. For student loan, bankruptcy is a last resort—but some borrowers are forced to file bankruptcy if the lender refuses to lower payments or modify interest rates.

Bankruptcy <a href="fraud">fraud</a> is a <a href="white-collar%20crime">white-collar crime</a>. While difficult to generalize across jurisdictions, common criminal acts under bankruptcy statutes typically involve concealment of assets, concealment or destruction of documents, conflicts of interest, fraudulent claims, false statements or declarations, and <a href="Fee%20fixing%20scandal">fee fixing</a> or redistribution arrangements. Falsifications on bankruptcy forms often constitute <a href="perjury">perjury</a>. Multiple filings are not in and of themselves criminal, but they may violate provisions of bankruptcy law. In the U.S., bankruptcy fraud statutes are particularly focused on the <a href="Mens%20rea">mental state</a> of particular actions. Bankruptcy fraud is a <a href="federal%20crime">federal crime</a> in the United States.

Bankruptcy fraud should be distinguished from "<a href="strategic%20bankruptcy">strategic bankruptcy</a>", which is not a <a href="crime">criminal</a> act since it creates a real (not a fake) bankruptcy state. However, it may still work against the filer.

All assets must be disclosed in bankruptcy schedules whether or not the debtor believes the asset has a <a href="net%20value">net value</a>. This is because once a bankruptcy petition is filed, it is for the creditors, not the debtor, to decide whether a particular asset has value. The future ramifications of omitting assets from schedules can be quite serious for the offending debtor. In the United States, a closed bankruptcy may be reopened by motion of a creditor or the U.S. trustee if a debtor attempts to later assert ownership of such an "unscheduled asset" after being discharged of all debt in the bankruptcy. The trustee may then seize the asset and liquidate it for the benefit of the (formerly discharged) creditors. Whether or not a concealment of such an asset should also be considered for prosecution as fraud or <a href="perjury">perjury</a> would then be at the discretion of the judge or U.S. Trustee.

In Argentina the national Act "24.522 de Concursos y Quiebras" regulates the Bankruptcy and the Reorganization of the individuals and companies, public entities are not included.

In Australia, bankruptcy is a status which applies to individuals and is governed by the federal "Bankruptcy Act 1966". Companies do not go bankrupt but rather go into <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> or <a href="administration%20%28insolvency%29">administration</a>, which is governed by the federal "<a href="Corporations%20Act%202001">Corporations Act 2001</a>".

If a person commits an act of bankruptcy, then a creditor can apply to the <a href="Federal%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Circuit Court</a> or the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Court</a> for a <a href="Sequestration%20%28law%29">sequestration order</a>. Acts of bankruptcy are defined in the legislation, and include the failure to comply with a bankruptcy notice. A bankruptcy notice can be issued where, among other cases, a person fails to pay a <a href="Judgment%20debtor">judgment debt</a>. A person can also seek to have himself or herself declared bankrupt by lodging a debtor's petition with the "Official Receiver", which is the Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA).

To declare bankruptcy or for a creditor to lodge a petition, the debt must be at least $5,000.

All bankrupts must lodge a Statement of Affairs document with AFSA, which includes important information about their assets and liabilities. A bankruptcy cannot be annulled until this document has been lodged.

Ordinarily, a bankruptcy lasts three years from the filing of the Statement of Affairs with AFSA.

A Bankruptcy Trustee (in most cases, the Official Receiver) is appointed to deal with all matters regarding the administration of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee's job includes notifying creditors of the estate and dealing with creditor inquiries; ensuring that the bankrupt complies with his or her obligations under the Bankruptcy Act; investigating the bankrupt's financial affairs; realising funds to which the estate is entitled under the Bankruptcy Act and distributing dividends to creditors if sufficient funds become available.

For the duration of their bankruptcy, all bankrupts have certain restrictions placed upon them. For example, a bankrupt must obtain the permission of his or her trustee to travel overseas. Failure to do so may result in the bankrupt being stopped at the airport by the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, a bankrupt is required to provide his or her trustee with details of income and assets. If the bankrupt does not comply with the Trustee's request to provide details of income, the trustee may have grounds to lodge an Objection to Discharge, which has the effect of extending the bankruptcy for a further five years.

The realisation of funds usually comes from two main sources: the bankrupt's assets and the bankrupt's wages. There are certain assets that are protected, referred to as "protected assets". These include household furniture and appliances, tools of the trade and vehicles up to a certain value. All other assets of value are sold. If a house or car is above a certain value, the bankrupt can buy the interest back from the estate in order to keep the asset. If the bankrupt does not do this, the interest vests in the estate and the trustee is able to take possession of the asset and sell it.

The bankrupt must pay income contributions if their income is above a certain threshold. If the bankrupt fails to pay, the trustee can issue a notice to garnishee the bankrupt's wages. If that is not possible, the Trustee may seek to extend the bankruptcy for a further five years.

Bankruptcies can be annulled prior to the expiration of the normal three-year period if all debts are paid out in full. Sometimes a bankrupt may be able to raise enough funds to make an Offer of Composition to creditors, which would have the effect of paying the creditors some of the money they are owed. If the creditors accept the offer, the bankruptcy can be annulled after the funds are received.

After the bankruptcy is annulled or the bankrupt has been automatically discharged, the bankrupt's credit report status is shown as "discharged bankrupt" for some years. The maximum number of years this information can be held is subject to the retention limits under the Privacy Act. How long such information is on a credit report may be shorter, depending on the issuing company, but the report must cease to record that information based on the criteria in the Privacy Act.

In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the Bankruptcy Law (11.101/05) governs court-ordered or out-of-court receivership and bankruptcy and only applies to public companies (publicly traded companies) with the exception of financial institutions, credit cooperatives, consortia, supplementary scheme entities, companies administering health care plans, equity companies and a few other legal entities. It does not apply to state-run companies.

Current law covers three legal proceedings. The first one is bankruptcy itself ("Falência"). Bankruptcy is a court-ordered liquidation procedure for an insolvent business. The final goal of bankruptcy is to liquidate company assets and pay its creditors.

The second one is Court-ordered Restructuring ("Recuperação Judicial"). The goal is to overcome the business crisis situation of the debtor in order to allow the continuation of the producer, the employment of workers and the interests of creditors, leading, thus, to preserving company, its corporate function and develop economic activity. It's a court procedure required by the debtor which has been in business for more than two years and requires approval by a judge.

The Extrajudicial Restructuring ("Recuperação Extrajudicial") is a private negotiation that involves creditors and debtors and, as with court-ordered restructuring, also must be approved by courts.

Bankruptcy, also referred to as insolvency in Canada, is governed by the <a href="Bankruptcy%20and%20Insolvency%20Act">Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</a> and is applicable to businesses and individuals, for example, <a href="Target%20Canada">Target Canada</a>, the Canadian subsidiary of the <a href="Target%20Corporation">Target Corporation</a>, the second-largest <a href="Discount%20store">discount retailer</a> in the United States filed for bankruptcy in January 15, 2015, and closed all of its stores by April 12. The office of the <a href="Superintendent%20of%20Bankruptcy">Superintendent of Bankruptcy</a>, a <a href="federal%20government%20of%20Canada">federal agency</a>, is responsible for overseeing that bankruptcies are administered in a fair and orderly manner by all licensed Trustees in Canada.

Trustees in bankruptcy, 1041 individuals licensed to administer insolvencies, bankruptcy and proposal estates and are governed by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act of Canada.

Bankruptcy is filed when a person or a company becomes insolvent and cannot pay their debts as they become due and if they have at least $1,000 in debt.

In 2011, the Superintendent of bankruptcy reported that trustees in Canada filed 127,774 insolvent estates. Consumer estates were the vast majority, with 122 999 estates. The consumer portion of the 2011 volume is divided into 77,993 bankruptcies and 45,006 consumer proposals. This represented a reduction of 8.9% from 2010. Commercial estates filed by Canadian trustees in 2011 4,775 estates, 3,643 bankruptcies and 1,132 Division 1 proposals. This represents a reduction of 8.6% over 2010.

Some of the duties of the trustee in bankruptcy are to:

Creditors become involved by attending creditors' meetings. The <a href="trustee">trustee</a> calls the first meeting of creditors for the following purposes:


In Canada, a person can file a consumer proposal as an alternative to bankruptcy. A consumer proposal is a negotiated settlement between a debtor and their creditors.

A typical proposal would involve a debtor making monthly payments for a maximum of five years, with the funds distributed to their creditors. Even though most proposals call for payments of less than the full amount of the debt owing, in most cases, the creditors accept the deal—because if they do not, the next alternative may be personal bankruptcy, in which the creditors get even less money. The creditors have 45 days to accept or reject the consumer proposal. Once the proposal is accepted by both the creditors and the Court, the debtor makes the payments to the Proposal Administrator each month (or as otherwise stipulated in their proposal), and the general creditors are prevented from taking any further legal or collection action. If the proposal is rejected, the debtor is returned to his prior insolvent state and may have no alternative but to declare personal bankruptcy.

A consumer proposal can only be made by a debtor with debts to a maximum of $250,000 (not including the mortgage on their principal residence). If debts are greater than $250,000, the proposal must be filed under Division 1 of Part III of the <a href="Bankruptcy%20and%20Insolvency%20Act%20%28Canada%29">Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</a>. An Administrator is required in the Consumer Proposal, and a Trustee in the Division I Proposal (these are virtually the same although the terms are not interchangeable). A Proposal Administrator is almost always a licensed <a href="trustee">trustee</a> in bankruptcy, although the <a href="Superintendent%20of%20Bankruptcy">Superintendent of Bankruptcy</a> may appoint other people to serve as administrators.

In 2006, there were 98,450 personal insolvency filings in Canada: 79,218 bankruptcies and 19,232 consumer proposals.

The People's Republic of China legalized bankruptcy in 1986, and a revised law that was more expansive and complete was enacted in 2007.

<a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland">Bankruptcy in Ireland</a> applies only to <a href="natural%20person">natural person</a>s. Other insolvency processes including <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> and <a href="examinership">examinership</a> are used to deal with corporate insolvency.

Irish bankruptcy law has been the subject of significant comment, from both government sources and the media, as being in need of reform. Part 7 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 has started this process and the government has committed to further reform.

The <a href="Parliament%20of%20India">Parliament of India</a> in the first week of May 2016 passed <a href="Insolvency%20and%20Bankruptcy%20Code">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code</a> 2016 (New Code). Earlier a clear law on corporate bankruptcy did not exist, even though individual bankruptcy laws have been in existence since 1874. The earlier law in force was enacted in 1920 called the Provincial Insolvency Act.

The legal definitions of the terms bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation and dissolution are contested in the Indian legal system. There is no regulation or statute legislated upon bankruptcy which denotes a condition of inability to meet a demand of a creditor as is common in many other jurisdictions.

Winding up of companies was in the jurisdiction of the courts which can take a decade even after the company has actually been declared insolvent. On the other hand, supervisory restructuring at the behest of the <a href="Board%20of%20Industrial%20and%20Financial%20Reconstruction">Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction</a> is generally undertaken using receivership by a public entity.

Dutch bankruptcy law is governed by the Dutch Bankruptcy Code ("Faillissementswet"). The code covers three separate legal proceedings. 

Federal Law No. 127-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 26 October 2002 (as amended) (the "Bankruptcy Act"), replacing the previous law in 1998, to better address the above problems and a broader failure of the action.
Russian insolvency law is intended for a wide range of borrowers: individuals and companies of all sizes, with the exception of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, political parties and religious organizations. There are also special rules for insurance companies, professional participants of the securities market, agricultural organizations and other special laws for financial institutions and companies in the <a href="natural%20monopoly">natural monopolies</a> in the energy industry.
Federal Law No. 40-FZ "On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)" dated 25 February 1999 (as amended) (the "Insolvency Law of Credit Institutions") contains special provisions in relation to the opening of insolvency proceedings in relation to the credit company. Insolvency Provisions Act, credit organizations used in conjunction with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act.

Bankruptcy law provides for the following stages of insolvency proceedings:
• Monitoring procedure (nablyudeniye);
• The economic recovery (finansovoe ozdorovleniye);
• External control (vneshneye upravleniye);
• Liquidation (konkursnoye proizvodstvo) and
• Amicable Agreement (mirovoye soglasheniye).

The main face of the bankruptcy process is the <a href="http%3A//arbir.ru/contact-insolvency-officer-cheskidov-roman.htm">insolvency officer (trustee in bankruptcy, bankruptcy manager)</a>. At various stages of bankruptcy, he must be determined: the temporary officer in Monitoring procedure, external manager in External control, the receiver or administrative officer in The economic recovery, the liquidator. During the bankruptcy trustee in bankruptcy (insolvency officer) has a decisive influence on the movement of assets (property) of the debtor - the debtor and has a key influence on the economic and legal aspects of its operations.

Under <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> law, bankruptcy can be a consequence of <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a>. It is a court-ordered form of debt enforcement proceedings that applies, in general, to registered commercial entities only. In a bankruptcy, all assets of the debtor are liquidated under the administration of the creditors, although the law provides for debt restructuring options similar to those under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.

In Sweden, bankruptcy (Swedish: konkurs) is a formal process that may involve a company or individual. It is not the same as <a href="insolvency">insolvency</a>, which is inability to pay debts that should have been paid. A creditor or the company itself can apply for bankruptcy. An external bankruptcy manager takes over the company or the assets of the person, and tries to sell as much as possible. A person or a company in bankruptcy can not access its assets (with some exceptions).

The formal bankruptcy process is rarely carried out for individuals. Creditors can claim money through the <a href="Enforcement%20Administration%20%28Sweden%29">Enforcement Administration</a> anyway, and creditors do not usually benefit from the bankruptcy of individuals because there are costs of a <a href="Trustee%20in%20bankruptcy">bankruptcy manager</a> which has priority. Unpaid debts remain after bankruptcy for individuals. People who are deeply in debt can obtain a debt arrangement procedure (Swedish: skuldsanering). On application, they obtain a payment plan under which they pay as much as they can for five years, and then all remaining debts are cancelled. Debts that derive from a ban on business operations (issued by court, commonly for tax fraud or fraudulent business practices) or owed to a crime victim as compensation for damages, are exempted from this—and, as before this process was introduced in 2006, remain lifelong. Debts that have not been claimed during a 3-10 year period are cancelled. Often crime victims stop their claims after a few years since criminals often do not have job incomes and might be hard to locate, while banks make sure their claims are not cancelled. The most common reasons for personal insolvency in Sweden are illness, unemployment, divorce or company bankruptcy.

For companies, formal bankruptcy is a normal effect of insolvency, even if there is a reconstruction mechanism where the company can be given time to solve its situation, e.g. by finding an investor. The formal bankruptcy involves contracting a bankruptcy manager, who makes certain that assets are sold and money divided by the priority the law claims, and no other way. Banks have such a priority. After a finished bankruptcy for a company, it is terminated. The activities might continue in a new company which has bought important assets from the bankrupted company.

<a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom</a> (in a strict legal sense) relates only to individuals (including <a href="Sole%20Trader%20Insolvency">sole proprietors</a>) and <a href="partnership">partnership</a>s. Companies and other <a href="corporation">corporation</a>s enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures: <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a> and <a href="administration%20%28law%29">administration</a> (<a href="administration%20order">administration order</a> and <a href="administrative%20receivership">administrative receivership</a>). However, the term 'bankruptcy' is often used when referring to companies in the media and in general conversation. Bankruptcy in Scotland is referred to as <a href="sequestration%20%28law%29">sequestration</a>. To apply for bankruptcy in Scotland, an individual must have more than £1,500 of debt.

A <a href="trustee%20in%20bankruptcy">trustee in bankruptcy</a> must be either an <a href="Official%20Receiver">Official Receiver</a> (a civil servant) or a licensed <a href="insolvency%20practitioner">insolvency practitioner</a>. Current law in England and Wales derives in large part from the <a href="Insolvency%20Act%201986">Insolvency Act 1986</a>. Following the introduction of the <a href="Enterprise%20Act%202002">Enterprise Act 2002</a>, a UK bankruptcy now normally last no longer than 12 months, and may be less if the Official Receiver files in court a certificate that investigations are complete. It was expected that the UK Government's liberalisation of the UK bankruptcy regime would increase the number of bankruptcy cases; initially, cases increased, as the Insolvency Service statistics appear to bear out. Since 2009, the introduction of the <a href="Debt%20Relief%20Order">Debt Relief Order</a> has resulted in a dramatic fall in bankruptcies, the latest estimates for year 2014/15 being significantly less than 30,000 cases.

The UK bankruptcy law was changed in May 2000, effective May 29, 2000. Debtors may now retain occupational <a href="pensions">pensions</a> while in bankruptcy, except in rare cases.

The Government have updated legislation (2016) to streamline the application process for UK bankruptcy. UK residents now need to apply online for bankruptcy - there is an upront fee of £655. The process for residents of Northern Ireland differs - applicants must follow the older process of applying through the courts.

Bankruptcy in the United States is a matter placed under <a href="Law%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal jurisdiction</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> (in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4), which empowers <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to enact "uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States". The Congress has enacted <a href="statutory%20law">statutes</a> governing bankruptcy, primarily in the form of the Bankruptcy Code, located at Title 11 of the <a href="United%20States%20Code">United States Code</a>. Federal law is amplified by state law in some places where Federal law fails to speak or expressly defers to state law.

While bankruptcy cases are always filed in <a href="United%20States%20Bankruptcy%20Court">United States Bankruptcy Court</a> (an adjunct to the <a href="U.S.%20District%20Courts">U.S. District Courts</a>), bankruptcy cases, particularly with respect to the validity of claims and exemptions, are often dependent upon State law. One example: two states, Maryland and Virginia, which are adjoining states, have different personal exemption amounts that cannot be seized for payment of debts. This amount is the first $6,000 in property or cash in Maryland, but only the first $5,000 in Virginia. State law therefore plays a major role in many bankruptcy cases, and it is often not possible to generalize bankruptcy law across state lines.

Generally, a debtor declares bankruptcy to obtain relief from debt, and this is accomplished either through a discharge of the debt or through a restructuring of the debt. Generally, when a debtor files a voluntary petition, his or her bankruptcy case commences.

There are six types of bankruptcy under the <a href="Title%2011%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Code">Bankruptcy Code</a>, located at Title 11 of the <a href="United%20States%20Code">United States Code</a>:

The most common types of <a href="personal%20bankruptcy">personal bankruptcy</a> for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Whether a person qualifies for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 is in part determined by income. As much as 65% of all U.S. consumer bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7 cases. Corporations and other business forms file under Chapters 7 or 11. Often called "straight bankruptcy" or "simple bankruptcy," it allows consumers to eliminate just about all of their debts over a period of three or four months. Typically, the only debts that survive a Chapter 7 are <a href="student%20loan">student loan</a>s, <a href="child%20support">child support</a> obligations, some tax bills and criminal fines. Credit cards, pay day loans, personal loans, medical bills, and just about all other bills are discharged.

Ninety-one percent of U.S. individuals who enter bankruptcy hire an attorney to file their Chapter 7 petitions. The typical cost of an attorney is $1,170.00. Alternatives to filing with an attorney are: filing pro se, hiring a non-lawyer petition preparer, or using online software to generate the petition.

In Chapter 7, a debtor surrenders non-exempt property to a bankruptcy trustee, who then liquidates the property and distributes the proceeds to the debtor's unsecured creditors. In exchange, the debtor is entitled to a discharge of some debt. However, the debtor is not granted a discharge if guilty of certain types of inappropriate behavior (e.g., concealing records relating to financial condition) and certain debts (e.g., spousal and child support and most student loans). Some taxes are not discharged even though the debtor is generally discharged from debt. Many individuals in financial distress own only exempt property (e.g., clothes, household goods, an older car, or the tools of their trade or profession) and do not have to surrender any property to the trustee. The amount of property that a debtor may exempt varies from state to state (as noted above, Virginia and Maryland have a $1,000 difference.) Chapter 7 relief is available only once in any eight-year period. Generally, the rights of secured creditors to their collateral continues, even though their debt is discharged. For example, absent some arrangement by a debtor to surrender a car or "reaffirm" a debt, the creditor with a <a href="security%20interest">security interest</a> in the debtor's car may repossess the car even if the debt to the creditor is discharged.

The 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code introduced the "means test" for eligibility for chapter 7. An individual who fails the means test has the chapter 7 case dismissed, or may have to convert to a chapter 13 case.

Generally, a trustee sells most of the debtor's assets to pay off creditors. However, certain debtor assets are protected to some extent. These include Social Security payments, unemployment compensation, limited equity in a home, car, or truck, household goods and appliances, trade tools, and books. However, these exemptions vary from state to state.

In Chapter 13, debtors retain ownership and possession of all their assets, but must devote some portion of future income to repaying creditors, generally over three to five years. The amount of payment and period of the repayment plan depend upon a variety of factors, including the value of the debtor's property and the amount of a debtor's income and expenses. Secured creditors may be entitled to greater payment than unsecured creditors.

Relief under Chapter 13 is available only to individuals with regular income whose debts do not exceed prescribed limits. If the debtor is an individual or a sole proprietor, the debtor is allowed to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay all or part of the debts. Under this chapter, the debtor can propose a repayment plan in which to pay creditors over three to five years. If the monthly income is less than the state's median income, the plan is for three years, unless the court finds "just cause" to extend the plan for a longer period. If the debtor's monthly income is greater than the median income for individuals in the debtor's state, the plan must generally be for five years. A plan cannot exceed the five-year limit.

In contrast to Chapter 7, the debtor in Chapter 13 may keep all property, whether or not exempt. If the plan appears feasible and if the debtor complies with all the other requirements, the bankruptcy court typically confirms the plan and the debtor and creditors are bound by its terms. Creditors have no say in the formulation of the plan, other than to object to it, if appropriate, on the grounds that it does not comply with one of the Code's statutory requirements. Generally, the debtor makes payments to a trustee who disburses the funds in accordance with the terms of the confirmed plan.

When the debtor completes payments pursuant to the terms of the plan, the court formallys grant the debtor a discharge of the debts provided for in the plan. However, if the debtor fails to make the agreed upon payments or fails to seek or gain court approval of a modified plan, a bankruptcy court often dismisses the case on the motion of the trustee. After a dismissal, creditors typically resume pursuit of state law remedies to recover the unpaid debt.

In Chapter 11, the debtor retains ownership and control of assets and is re-termed a "<a href="debtor%20in%20possession">debtor in possession</a>" (DIP). The debtor in possession runs the day-to-day operations of the business while creditors and the debtor work with the Bankruptcy Court in order to negotiate and complete a plan. Upon meeting certain requirements (e.g., fairness among creditors, priority of certain creditors) creditors are permitted to vote on the proposed plan. If a plan is confirmed, the debtor continues to operate and pay debts under the terms of the confirmed plan. If a specified majority of creditors do not vote to confirm a plan, additional requirements may be imposed by the court in order to confirm the plan. Debtors filing for Chapter 11 protection a second time are known informally as "Chapter 22" filers.

Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the efficient bankruptcy chapters often used by most individuals. The chapters which almost always apply to consumer debtors are chapter 7, known as a "straight bankruptcy", and chapter 13, which involves an affordable plan of repayment. An important feature applicable to all types of bankruptcy filings is the <a href="automatic%20stay">automatic stay</a>. The automatic stay means that the mere request for bankruptcy protection automatically halts most lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility shut-offs, and debt collection activity.

A Bankruptcy Exemption defines the property a debtor may retain and preserve through bankruptcy. Certain real and personal property can be exempted on "Schedule C" of a debtor's bankruptcy forms, and effectively be taken outside the debtor's bankruptcy estate. Bankruptcy exemptions are available only to individuals filing bankruptcy. There are two alternative systems that can be used to "exempt" property from a bankruptcy estate, federal exemptions (available in some states but not all), and state exemptions (which vary widely between states).

After a bankruptcy petition is filed, the court schedules a hearing called a "341 meeting" or "meeting of creditors", at which the bankruptcy trustee and creditors review the petitioner's petition and supporting schedules, question the petitioner, and can challenge exemptions they believe are improper.

The <a href="Bankruptcy%20Abuse%20Prevention%20and%20Consumer%20Protection%20Act">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act</a> (BAPCPA) of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23 (April 20, 2005) ("BAPCPA"), substantially amended the Bankruptcy Code. Many provisions of BAPCPA were forcefully advocated by consumer lenders and were just as forcefully opposed by many consumer advocates, bankruptcy academics, bankruptcy judges, and bankruptcy lawyers. The enactment of BAPCPA followed nearly eight years of debate in Congress. According to the book, "<a href="The%20Unwinding">The Unwinding</a>", <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, <a href="Chris%20Dodd">Chris Dodd</a>, and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> helped pass this bill. Most of the law's provisions became effective on October 17, 2005. Upon signing the bill, <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">President Bush</a> stated:

Advocates of BAPCPA claimed that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates. Critics have argued that these claims turned out to be false. After BAPCPA passed, although credit card company losses decreased, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.

Among its many changes to consumer bankruptcy law, BAPCPA includes a "means test", which was intended to make it more difficult for a significant number of financially distressed individual debtors whose debts are primarily consumer debts to qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The "means test" is employed in cases where an individual with primarily consumer debts has more than the average annual income for a household of equivalent size, computed over a 180-day period prior to filing. If the individual must "take" the "means test", their average monthly income over this 180-day period is reduced by a series of allowances for living expenses and secured debt payments in a very complex calculation that may or may not accurately reflect that individual's actual monthly budget. If the results of the means test show no disposable income (or in some cases a very small amount) then the individual qualifies for Chapter 7 relief. If a debtor does not qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, either because of the Means Test or because Chapter 7 does not provide a permanent solution to delinquent payments for secured debts, such as mortgages or vehicle loans, the debtor may still seek relief under Chapter 13 of the Code. A Chapter 13 plan often does not require repayment to general unsecured debts, such as credit cards or medical bills.

BAPCPA also requires individuals seeking bankruptcy relief to undertake <a href="credit%20counselling">credit counselling</a> with approved counseling agencies prior to filing a bankruptcy petition and to undertake education in personal financial management from approved agencies prior to being granted a discharge of debts under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Some studies of the operation of the credit counseling requirement suggest that it provides little benefit to debtors who receive the counseling because the only realistic option for many is to seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code.

In 2004, the number of insolvencies reached record highs in many European countries. In <a href="France">France</a>, company insolvencies rose by more than 4%, in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> by more than 10%, and in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> by more than 20%. The increase in the number of insolvencies, however, does not indicate the total financial impact of insolvencies in each country because there is no indication of the size of each case. An increase in the number of bankruptcy cases does not necessarily entail an increase in bad debt write-off rates for the economy as a whole.

Bankruptcy statistics are also a trailing indicator. There is a time delay between financial difficulties and bankruptcy. In most cases, several months or even years pass between the financial problems and the start of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal, tax, and cultural issues may further distort bankruptcy figures, especially when comparing on an international basis. Two examples:

The insolvency numbers for private individuals also do not show the whole picture. Only a fraction of heavily indebted households file for insolvency. Two of the main reasons for this are the stigma of declaring themselves insolvent and the potential business disadvantage.

Following the soar in insolvencies in the last decade, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, began to revamp their bankruptcy laws in 2013. They modelled these new laws after the image of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the majority of insolvency cases have ended in liquidation in Europe rather than the businesses surviving the crisis. These new law models are meant to change this; lawmakers are hoping to turn bankruptcy into a chance for restructuring rather than a death sentence for the companies.

Blissymbols

Blissymbols or Blissymbolics was conceived as an <a href="ideographic">ideographic</a> writing system called Semantography consisting of several hundred basic <a href="symbol">symbol</a>s, each representing a concept, which can be composed together to generate new symbols that represent new concepts. Blissymbols differ from most of the world's major writing systems in that the characters do not correspond at all to the sounds of any <a href="spoken%20language">spoken language</a>.

Blissymbols was invented by <a href="Charles%20K.%20Bliss">Charles K. Bliss</a> (1897–1985), born Karl Kasiel Blitz in the Austro-Hungarian city of <a href="Czernowitz">Czernowitz</a> (at present the Ukrainian city of <a href="Chernivtsi">Chernivtsi</a>), which had a mixture of different nationalities that “hated each other, mainly because they spoke and thought in different languages.” 
Bliss graduated as a chemical engineer at the <a href="Vienna%20University%20of%20Technology">Vienna University of Technology</a>, and joined an electronics company as a research chemist.

As the German Army invaded Austria in 1938, Bliss, a <a href="Jew">Jew</a>, was sent to the concentration camps of <a href="Dachau%20concentration%20camp">Dachau</a> and <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald</a>. His German wife Claire managed to get him released, and they finally became exiles in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, where Bliss had a cousin.

Bliss devised Blissymbols while a refugee at the <a href="Shanghai%20Ghetto">Shanghai Ghetto</a> and <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, from 1942 to 1949. He wanted to create an easy-to-learn <a href="international%20auxiliary%20language">international auxiliary language</a> to allow communication between different linguistic communities. He was inspired by <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese character</a>s, with which he became familiar at Shanghai.

Bliss’s system was explained in his work "Semantography" (1949, 2nd ed. 1965, 3rd ed. 1978.)
It had several names:
As the “tourist explosion” took place in the 1960s, a number of researchers were looking for new standard symbols to be used at roads, stations, airports, etc. Bliss then adopted the name "Blissymbolics" in order that no researcher could plagiarize his system of symbols.

Since the 1960s/1970s, Blissymbols have become popular as a method to teach disabled people to communicate.
In 1971 Shirley McNaughton started a pioneer program at the <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> Crippled Children’s Centre (OCCC), aimed at children with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>, from the approach of <a href="augmentative%20and%20alternative%20communication">augmentative and alternative communication</a> (AAC). According to <a href="Arika%20Okrent">Arika Okrent</a>, Bliss used to complain about the way the teachers at the OCCC were using the symbols, in relation with the proportions of the symbols and other questions: for example, they used “fancy” terms like “nouns” and “verbs”, to describe what Bliss called “things” and “actions”. (2009, p. 173-4).
The ultimate objective of the OCCC program was to use Blissymbols as a practical way to teach the children to express themselves in their mother tongue, since the Blissymbols provided visual keys to understand the meaning of the English words, especially the abstract words.

In his work "Semantography" Bliss had not provided a systematic set of definitions for his symbols (there was a provisional vocabulary index instead (1965, pp. 827–67)), so McNaughton’s team might often interpret a certain symbol in a way that Bliss would later criticize as a “misinterpretation”. For example, they might interpret a tomato as a vegetable —according to the English definition of tomato— even though the ideal Blissymbol of vegetable was restricted by Bliss to just vegetables growing underground. Eventually the OCCC staff modified and adapted Bliss’s system in order to make it serve as a bridge to English. (2009, p. 189) Bliss complaints about his symbols “being abused” by the OCCC became so intense that the director of the OCCC told Bliss, on his 1974 visit, never to come back. In spite of this, in 1975 Bliss granted an exclusive world license, for use with disabled children, to the new Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton (later called Blissymbolics Communication International, BCI). Nevertheless, in 1977 Bliss claimed that this agreement was violated so that he was deprived of effective control of his symbol system.

According to Okrent (2009, p. 190), there was a final period of conflict, as Bliss would make continuous criticisms to McNaughton often followed by apologies. Bliss finally brought his lawyers back to the OCCC, and both parts reached a settlement:

Blissymbolic Communication International now claims an exclusive license from Bliss, for the use and publication of Blissymbols for persons with communication, language, and learning difficulties.

The Blissymbol method has been used in Canada, Sweden, and a few other countries. Practitioners of Blissymbolics (that is, speech and language therapists and users) maintain that some users who have learned to communicate with Blissymbolics find it easier to learn to read and write traditional orthography in the local spoken language than do users who did not know Blissymbolics.

Unlike similar constructed languages like <a href="AUI%20%28constructed%20language%29">aUI</a>, Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely <a href="Visual%20language">visual</a>, speech-less language, on the premise that “interlinguistic communication is mainly carried on by reading and writing”. Nevertheless, Bliss suggested that a set of international words could be adopted, so that “a kind of spoken language could be established – as a travelling aid only”. (1965, p. 89–90).

So, whether Blissymbolics constitutes an unspoken language is a controversial question, whatever its practical utility may be. Some linguists, such as <a href="John%20DeFrancis">John DeFrancis</a> and <a href="J.%20Marshall%20Unger">J. Marshall Unger</a> have argued that genuine ideographic writing systems with the same capacities as <a href="natural%20language">natural language</a>s do not exist. It is not certain, however, that they have examined Blissymbols.

Bliss’s concern about <a href="semantics">semantics</a> finds an early referent in <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, whose "<a href="Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>" prevented people from those "vague and insignificant forms of speech" that may give the impression of being deep learning.

Another vital referent is <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a>’s project of an ideographic language called "<a href="Characteristica%20universalis">universal character</a>", based on the principles of Chinese characters. It would contain small figures representing "visible things by their lines, and the invisible, by the visible which accompany them", as well as adding "certain additional marks, suitable to make understood the flexions and the particles." (1965, p. 569). Bliss stated that his own work was an attempt to take up the thread of Leibniz’s project.

Finally there is a strong influence by the work "<a href="The%20Meaning%20of%20Meaning">The Meaning of Meaning</a>" by <a href="C.%20K.%20Ogden">C. K. Ogden</a> and <a href="I.%20A.%20Richards">I. A. Richards</a>, which was considered a standard work on semantics. Bliss found especially useful their "triangle of reference": the physical thing or "referent" that we perceive would be represented at the right angle; the meaning that we know by experience (our implicit definition of the thing), at the top angle; and the physical word that we speak or write, at the left angle. The reversed process would happen when we read or listen to words: from the words, we recall meanings, related to referents which may be real things or unreal "fictions". Bliss was particularly concerned with political propaganda, whose discourses would tend to contain words that correspond to unreal or ambiguous referents.
The grammar of Blissymbols is based on a certain interpretation of nature, dividing it into matter (material things), energy (actions), and human values (mental evaluations). In an ordinary language, these would give place respectively to <a href="substantive">substantive</a>s, <a href="verb">verb</a>s, and <a href="adjective">adjective</a>s. In Blissymbols, they are marked respectively by a small square symbol, a small cone symbol, and a small V or inverted cone. These symbols may be placed above any other symbol, turning it respectively into a “thing”, an “action”, and an “evaluation”:

When a symbol is not marked by any of the three grammar symbols (square, cone, inverted cone), they may be a non material thing, a <a href="grammatical%20particle">grammatical particle</a>, etc.

The symbol above represents the expression "world language", which was a first tentative name for Blissymbols.
It combines the symbol for "writing tool" or "pen" (a line inclined, as a pen being used) with the symbol for "world", which in its turn combines "ground" or "earth" (a horizontal line below) and its counterpart derivate "sky" (a horizontal line above). Thus the world would be seen as "what is among the ground and the sky", and "Blissymbols" would be seen as "the writing tool to express the world". This is clearly distinct from the symbol of "language", which is a combination of "mouth" and "ear". Thus natural languages are mainly oral, while Blissymbols is just a writing system dealing with semantics, not phonetics.

The 900 individual symbols of the system are called "Bliss-characters"; these may be "<a href="ideographic">ideographic</a>" – representing abstract concepts, "<a href="pictographic">pictographic</a>" – a direct representation of objects, or "composite" – in which two or more existing Bliss-characters have been superimposed to represent a new meaning. Size, orientation and relation to the "skyline" and "earthline" affects the meaning of each symbol. A single concept is called a "Bliss-word", which can consist of one or more Bliss-characters. In the case of multiple character Bliss-words, the main character is called the "classifier" which "indicates the semantic or grammatical category to which the Bliss-word belongs". To this can be added Bliss-characters as prefixes or suffixes called "modifiers" which amend the meaning of the first symbol. A further symbol, called an "indicator" can be added adjacent to the Bliss-word; these are used as "grammatical and/or semantic markers."
This sentence means "I want to go to the cinema." This example shows several features of Blissymbolics:

As elucidated above, Blissymbolics was used in 1971 to help children at the Ontario Crippled Children’s Centre (OCCC, now the <a href="Bloorview%20Kids%20Rehab">Bloorview Kids Rehab</a>) in <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, Canada. Since it was important that the children see consistent pictures, OCCC had a <a href="draftsman">draftsman</a> named Jim Grice draw the symbols. Both Charles K. Bliss and Margrit Beesley at the OCCC worked with Grice to ensure consistency. In 1975, a new organization named Blissymbolics Communication Foundation directed by Shirley McNaughton led this effort. Over the years, this organization changed its name to Blissymbolics Communication Institute, <a href="Easter%20Seal">Easter Seal</a> Communication Institute, and ultimately to Blissymbolics Communication International (BCI).

BCI is an international group of people who act as an authority regarding the <a href="standardization">standardization</a> of the Blissymbolics language. It has taken responsibility for any extensions of the Blissymbolics language as well as any maintenance needed for the language. BCI has coordinated usage of the language since 1971 for augmentative and alternative communication. BCI received a licence and copyright through legal agreements with Charles K. Bliss in 1975 and 1982. Limiting the count of Bliss-characters (there are currently about 900) is very useful in order to help the user community. It also helps when implementing Blissymbolics using technology such as computers.

In 1991, BCI published a reference guide containing 2300 vocabulary items and detailed rules for the graphic design of additional characters, so they settled a first set of approved "Bliss-words" for general use.
The <a href="Standards%20Council%20of%20Canada">Standards Council of Canada</a> then sponsored, on January 21, 1993, the registration of an encoded character set for use in ISO/IEC 2022, in the <a href="ISO-IR">ISO-IR</a> international registry of coded character sets.
After many years of requests, the Blissymbolic language was finally approved as an encoded language, with code zbl, into the <a href="ISO%20639-2">ISO 639-2</a> and <a href="ISO%20639-3">ISO 639-3</a> standards.

A proposal was posted by <a href="Michael%20Everson">Michael Everson</a> for the Blissymbolics script to be included in the <a href="Universal%20Character%20Set">Universal Character Set</a> (UCS) and encoded for use with the <a href="ISO/IEC%2010646">ISO/IEC 10646</a> and <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> standards. BCI would cooperate with the Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) and the ISO Working Group.
The proposed encoding does not use the lexical encoding model used in the existing ISO-IR/169 registered character set, but instead applies the Unicode and ISO character-glyph model to the "Bliss-character" model already adopted by BCI, since this would significantly reduce the number of needed characters. Bliss-characters can now be used in a creative way to create many new arbitrary concepts, by surrounding the invented words with special Bliss indicators (similar to punctuation), something which was not possible in the ISO-IR/169 encoding.

However, at the end of 2009, the Blissymbolic script is still not encoded in the UCS. Some questions are still unanswered, such as the inclusion in the BCI repertoire of some characters (currently about 24) that are already encoded in the UCS (like digits, punctuation signs, spaces and some markers), but whose unification may cause problems due to the very strict graphical layouts required by the published Bliss reference guides. In addition, the character metrics use a specific layout where the usual <a href="baseline%20%28typography%29">baseline</a> is not used, and the ideographic em-square is not relevant for Bliss character designs, that use additional "earth line" and "sky line" to define the composition square. 
Some fonts supporting the BCI repertoire are available and usable with texts encoded with <a href="Private%20Use%20Area">private-use assignments</a> (PUA) within the UCS. But only the private BCI encoding based on ISO-IR/169 registration is available for text interchange.

Bessel function

Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician <a href="Daniel%20Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a> and then generalized by <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a>, are the <a href="Canonical%20form">canonical</a> solutions formula_1 of Bessel's <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>
for an arbitrary <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a> , the "order" of the Bessel function. Although and − produce the same differential equation for real , it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of .

The most important cases are when is an <a href="integer">integer</a> or <a href="half-integer">half-integer</a>.
Bessel functions for integer are also known as cylinder functions or the <a href="cylindrical%20harmonics">cylindrical harmonics</a> because they appear in the solution to <a href="Laplace%27s%20equation">Laplace's equation</a> in <a href="cylindrical%20coordinates">cylindrical coordinates</a>. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer are obtained when the <a href="Helmholtz%20equation">Helmholtz equation</a> is solved in <a href="spherical%20coordinates">spherical coordinates</a>.

Bessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to <a href="Laplace%27s%20equation">Laplace's equation</a> and the <a href="Helmholtz%20equation">Helmholtz equation</a> in cylindrical or <a href="spherical%20coordinates">spherical coordinates</a>. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of <a href="wave%20propagation">wave propagation</a> and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order ( = "n"); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders ( = "n"+1/2). For example:

Bessel functions also appear in other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see <a href="FM%20synthesis">FM synthesis</a>, <a href="Kaiser%20window">Kaiser window</a>, or <a href="Bessel%20filter">Bessel filter</a>).

Because this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two <a href="linearly%20independent">linearly independent</a> solutions. Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient. Different variations are summarized in the table below, and described in the following sections.

Bessel functions of the second kind and the spherical Bessel functions of the second kind are sometimes denoted by "N" and "n", respectively, rather than "Y" and "y".

Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as "J"("x"), are solutions of Bessel's differential equation that are finite at the origin ("x" = 0) for integer or positive α, and diverge as "x" approaches zero for negative non-integer α. It is possible to define the function by its <a href="Taylor%20series">series expansion</a> around "x" = 0, which can be found by applying the <a href="Frobenius%20method">Frobenius method</a> to Bessel's equation:

where Γ("z") is the <a href="gamma%20function">gamma function</a>, a shifted generalization of the <a href="factorial">factorial</a> function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an <a href="entire%20function">entire function</a> if is an integer, otherwise it is a <a href="multivalued%20function">multivalued function</a> with singularity at zero. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√"x" (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large "x". (The series indicates that −"J"("x") is the derivative of "J"("x"), much like −sin("x") is the derivative of cos("x"); more generally, the derivative of "J"("x") can be expressed in terms of "J"("x") by the identities <a href="Bessel%20function%23Properties">below</a>.)

For non-integer , the functions "J"("x") and "J"("x") are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order , the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):

This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.

Another definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of "n", is possible using an integral representation:

Another integral representation is:

This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by one of Schläfli's integrals, for formula_7:

The Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the <a href="generalized%20hypergeometric%20series">generalized hypergeometric series</a> as

This expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the <a href="Bessel%E2%80%93Clifford%20function">Bessel–Clifford function</a>.

In terms of the <a href="Laguerre%20polynomials">Laguerre polynomials</a> "L" and arbitrarily chosen parameter "t", the Bessel function can be expressed as

The Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by "Y"("x"), occasionally denoted instead by "N"("x"), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation that have a singularity at the origin ("x" = 0) and are <a href="multivalued%20function">multivalued</a>. These are sometimes called Weber functions as they were introduced by , and also Neumann functions after <a href="Carl%20Neumann">Carl Neumann</a>.

For non-integer , "Y"("x") is related to "J"("x") by:

In the case of integer order , the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer tends to ,
If "n" is a nonnegative integer we have the series

There is also a corresponding integral formula (for Re() > 0),

"Y"("x") is necessary as the second linearly independent solution of the Bessel's equation when α is an integer. But "Y"("x") has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a 'natural' partner of "J"("x"). See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.

When is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:

Both "J"("x") and "Y"("x") are <a href="holomorphic%20function">holomorphic function</a>s of on the <a href="complex%20plane">complex plane</a> cut along the negative real axis. When is an integer, the Bessel functions are <a href="entire%20function">entire function</a>s of . If is held fixed at a non-zero value, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of .

The Bessel functions of the second kind when is an integer is an example of the second kind of solution in <a href="Fuchs%27s%20theorem">Fuchs's theorem</a>.

Another important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel's equation are the Hankel functions of the first and second kind, "H"("x") and "H"("x"), defined by:

where "i" is the <a href="imaginary%20unit">imaginary unit</a>. These linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel's differential equation. They are named after <a href="Hermann%20Hankel">Hermann Hankel</a>.

The importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, 'simple' means an appearance of the factor of the form "e". The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.

The Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the <a href="sign%20convention">sign convention</a> for the <a href="frequency">frequency</a>).

Using the previous relationships they can be expressed as:

If α is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether α is an integer or not:

In particular, if = "m" + 1/2 with "m" a nonnegative integer, the above relations imply directly that

These are useful in developing the spherical Bessel functions (below).

The Hankel functions admit the following integral representations for Re("x") > 0:

where the integration limits indicate integration along a <a href="Methods%20of%20contour%20integration">contour</a> that can be chosen as follows: from −∞ to 0 along the negative real axis, from 0 to ±iπ along the imaginary axis, and from ±iπ to +∞±iπ along a contour parallel to the real axis.

The Bessel functions are valid even for <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> arguments , and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument. In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the modified Bessel functions (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind, and are defined by:

when is not an integer; when is an integer, then the limit is used. These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments . The series expansion for is thus similar to that for , but without the alternating (−1) factor.

If can be expressed as a Hankel function of the first kind:
and if , it can be expressed as a Hankel function of the second kind:

We can express the first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions (these are valid if ),

Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument, "I" and "K" are <a href="exponential%20growth">exponentially growing</a> and <a href="exponential%20decay">decaying</a> functions, respectively. Like the ordinary Bessel function "J", the function "I" goes to zero at = 0 for > 0 and is finite at = 0 for = 0. Analogously, "K" diverges at  = 0 with the singularity being of logarithmic type.

Two integral formulas for the modified Bessel functions are (for Re("x") > 0):

In some calculations in physics, it can be useful to know that the following relation holds:

It can be proven by showing equality to the above integral definition for "K". This is done by integrating a closed curve in the first quadrant of the complex plane.

Modified Bessel functions "K" and "K" can be represented in terms of rapidly converged integrals

The modified Bessel function of the second kind has also been called by the now-rare names:

When solving the <a href="Helmholtz%20equation">Helmholtz equation</a> in spherical coordinates by separation of variables, the radial equation has the form:

The two linearly independent solutions to this equation are called the spherical Bessel functions "j" and "y", and are related to the ordinary Bessel functions "J" and "Y" by:

"y" is also denoted "n" or <a href="Eta%20%28letter%29">η</a>; some authors call these functions the spherical Neumann functions.

The spherical Bessel functions can also be written as (Rayleigh's formulas):

The first spherical Bessel function "j"("x") is also known as the (unnormalized) <a href="sinc%20function">sinc function</a>. The first few spherical Bessel functions are:
and

The spherical Bessel functions have the generating functions 

In the following "f" is any of formula_53 for formula_54

There are also spherical analogues of the Hankel functions:

In fact, there are simple closed-form expressions for the Bessel functions of <a href="half-integer">half-integer</a> order in terms of the standard <a href="trigonometric%20function">trigonometric function</a>s, and therefore for the spherical Bessel functions. In particular, for non-negative integers "n":

and formula_60 is the complex-conjugate of this (for real "x"). It follows, for example, that formula_61 and formula_62, and so on.

The spherical Hankel functions appear in problems involving spherical wave propagation, for example in <a href="Electromagnetic%20wave%20equation%23Multipole%20expansion">the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field</a>.

<a href="Jacopo%20Riccati">Riccati</a>–Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:

They satisfy the differential equation:

For example, this kind of differential equation appears in Quantum Mechanics while solving the radial component of the Schrödinger's Equation with hypothetical cylindrical infinite potential barrier. For reference see p. 154, Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths, 2nd Edition. This differential equation, and the Riccati–Bessel solutions, also arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as <a href="Mie%20scattering">Mie scattering</a> after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004) for recent developments and references.

Following <a href="Peter%20Debye">Debye</a> (1909), the notation formula_68 is sometimes used instead of formula_69.

The Bessel functions have the following <a href="Asymptotic%20analysis">asymptotic</a> forms. For small arguments formula_70, one obtains, when α is not a negative integer:

When α is a negative integer, we have:

For the Bessel function of the second kind we have three cases:

where γ is the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni%20constant">Euler–Mascheroni constant</a> (0.5772...).

For large real arguments formula_74, one cannot write a true asymptotic form for Bessel functions of the first and second kind (unless α is <a href="half-integer">half-integer</a>) because they have <a href="zero%20of%20a%20function">zeros</a> all the way out to infinity which would have to be matched exactly by any asymptotic expansion. However, for a given value of arg("z") one can write an equation containing a term of order |"z"|:

(For α = 1/2 the last terms in these formulas drop out completely; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Even though these equations are true, better approximations may be available for complex "z". For example, "J"("z") when "z" is near the negative real line is approximated better by

than by

The asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions are:

These can be extended to other values of arg("z") using equations relating formula_79 and formula_80 to "H"("z") and "H"("z").
It is interesting that although the Bessel function of the first kind is the average of the two Hankel functions, "J"("z") is not asymptotic to the average of these two asymptotic forms when "z" is negative (because one or the other will not be correct there, depending on the arg("z") used). But the asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions permit us to write asymptotic forms for the Bessel functions of first and second kinds for complex (non-real) "z" so long as |"z"| goes to infinity at a constant phase angle arg "z" (using the square root having positive real part):

For the modified Bessel functions, <a href="Hermann%20Hankel">Hankel</a> developed <a href="asymptotic%20expansion">asymptotic expansion</a>s as well:

When α = 1/2 all the terms except the first vanish and we have

For small arguments formula_85, we have:

For integer order = "n", "J" is often defined via a <a href="Laurent%20series">Laurent series</a> for a generating function:

an approach used by <a href="P.%20A.%20Hansen">P. A. Hansen</a> in 1843. (This can be generalized to non-integer order by <a href="Methods%20of%20contour%20integration">contour integration</a> or other methods.) Another important relation for integer orders is the "<a href="Jacobi%E2%80%93Anger%20expansion">Jacobi–Anger expansion</a>":

and

which is used to expand a <a href="plane%20wave">plane wave</a> as a <a href="plane%20wave%20expansion">sum of cylindrical waves</a>, or to find the <a href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a> of a tone-modulated <a href="Frequency%20modulation">FM</a> signal.

More generally, a series

is called Neumann expansion of "ƒ". The coefficients for ν = 0 have the explicit form

where "O" is <a href="Neumann%20polynomial">Neumann's polynomial</a>.

Selected functions admit the special representation

with

due to the orthogonality relation

More generally, if "ƒ" has a branch-point near the origin of such a nature that

then

or

where formula_99 is "f"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Laplace%20transform">Laplace transform</a>.

Another way to define the Bessel functions is the Poisson representation formula and the Mehler-Sonine formula:

where ν > −1/2 and "z" ∈ C.
This formula is useful especially when working with <a href="Fourier%20transforms">Fourier transforms</a>.

Because Bessel's equation becomes <a href="Hermitian">Hermitian</a> (self-adjoint) if it is divided by "x", the solutions must satisfy an orthogonality relationship for appropriate boundary conditions. In particular, it follows that:

where α > −1, δ is the <a href="Kronecker%20delta">Kronecker delta</a>, and "u" is the "m"-th <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">zero</a> of "J"("x"). This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the <a href="Fourier%E2%80%93Bessel%20series">Fourier–Bessel series</a>, where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions "J"("x" "u") for fixed α and varying "m".

An analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately:

If one defines a <a href="boxcar%20function">boxcar function</a> of "x" that depends on a small parameter ε as:

(where rect() is the <a href="rectangle%20function">rectangle function</a>) then the <a href="Hankel%20transform">Hankel transform</a> of it (of any given order α greater than −1/2), "g"("k"), approaches "J"("k") as ε approaches zero, for any given "k". Conversely, the Hankel transform (of the same order) of "g"("k") is "f"("x"):

which is zero everywhere except near 1. As ε approaches zero, the right-hand side approaches δ("x"−1), where δ is the <a href="Dirac%20delta%20function">Dirac delta function</a>. So by abuse of language (or "formally"), one says that

even though the integral on the left is not actually defined. A change of variables then yields the "closure equation":

for α > −1/2. The Hankel transform can express a fairly arbitrary function as an integral of Bessel functions of different scales. For the spherical Bessel functions the orthogonality relation is:

for α > −1. Again, this is a useful formal equation whose left-hand side is not actually defined.

Another important property of Bessel's equations, which follows from <a href="Abel%27s%20identity">Abel's identity</a>, involves the <a href="Wronskian">Wronskian</a> of the solutions:

where "A" and "B" are any two solutions of Bessel's equation, and "C" is a constant independent of "x" (which depends on α and on the particular Bessel functions considered). In particular,
and

for α > −1. 
For α > −1, the even entire function of genus 1, formula_111, has only real zeros. Let 
be all its positive zeros, then

The functions "J", "Y", "H", and "H" all satisfy the <a href="recurrence%20relation">recurrence relation</a>s:

where "Z" denotes "J", "Y", "H", or "H". (These two identities are often combined, e.g. added or subtracted, to yield various other relations.) In this way, for example, one can compute Bessel functions of higher orders (or higher derivatives) given the values at lower orders (or lower derivatives). In particular, it follows that:

"Modified" Bessel functions follow similar relations :

and

The recurrence relation reads

where "C" denotes "I" or "e""K". These recurrence relations are useful for discrete diffusion problems.

The Bessel functions obey a <a href="multiplication%20theorem">multiplication theorem</a>

where λ and ν may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers, see. The above expression also holds if formula_123 is replaced by formula_124. The analogous identities for modified Bessel functions are

and

Bessel himself originally proved that for non-negative integers "n", the equation "J"("x") = 0 has an infinite number of solutions in "x". When the functions "J"("x") are plotted on the same graph, though, none of the zeros seem to coincide for different values of "n" except for the zero at "x" = 0. This phenomenon is known as Bourget's hypothesis after the nineteenth-century French mathematician who studied Bessel functions. Specifically it states that for any integers "n" ≥ 0 and "m" ≥ 1, the functions "J"("x") and "J"("x") have no common zeros other than the one at "x" = 0. The hypothesis was proved by <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Siegel">Carl Ludwig Siegel</a> in 1929.

Brahui language

Brahui () is a <a href="Dravidian%20language">Dravidian language</a> spoken primarily by the <a href="Brahui%20people">Brahui people</a> in the central part of <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Baluchistan province</a> in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and in scattered parts of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, and by expatriate Brahui communities in <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>, <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. It is isolated from the nearest Dravidian-speaking neighbour population of <a href="South%20India">South India</a> by a distance of more than . <a href="Kalat%20District">Kalat</a>, <a href="Mastung%20District">Mastung</a> <a href="Khuzdar%20District">Khuzdar</a> and parts of <a href="Quetta%20District">Quetta</a> districts of Balochistan are predominantly Brahui-speaking.

Brahui is spoken in the central part of Pakistani Balochistan, mainly in <a href="Kalat%20District">Kalat</a>, <a href="Mastung%20District">Mastung</a>, and <a href="Khuzdar%20District">Khuzdar</a> districts but also in smaller numbers in neighboring districts, as well as in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> which borders Pakistani Balochistan; however, many members of the ethnic group <a href="language%20attrition">no longer speak</a> Brahui. The 2013 edition of <a href="Ethnologue">Ethnologue</a> reports that there are 4 million speakers of the language, and primarily in the Pakistan province of Balochistan. There are also an unknown very small number of expatriate Brahuis in the Arab States of the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, Iranian Balochistan, and Turkmenistan.

Brahui belongs, with <a href="Kurukh%20language">Kurukh</a> (Oraon) and <a href="Malto%20language">Malto</a>, to the northern subfamily of the Dravidian family of languages. It has been influenced by the <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian languages</a> spoken in the area, especially <a href="Balochi%20language">Balochi</a>.

There are no important dialectical differences. Jhalawani (southern, centered on <a href="Khuzdar">Khuzdar</a>) and Sarawani (northern, centered on <a href="Kalat%2C%20Pakistan">Kalat</a>) dialects are distinguished by the pronunciation of *h, which is only retained in the north. (Elfenbein 1997)

The vowels are the same as Balochi: long "a e i o u", short "a i u", diphthongs "aj, aw". Stress has also been borrowed from Balochi, and occurs on the first long vowel or diphthong, or on the first syllable if all vowels are short.

Consonants are less similar to Balochi, with differences in the patterns of retroflexion and aspiration, with Brahui further differing in having native fricatives, which include the <a href="voiceless%20lateral%20fricative">voiceless lateral fricative</a> , a sound not otherwise found in the region.

Brahui is the only <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian language</a> which is not known to have been written in a <a href="Brahmic%20family%20of%20scripts">Brahmi</a>-based script; instead, it is written in the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a> since the second half of the 20th century. More recently, a Roman-based orthography named <a href="Brolikva">Brolikva</a> (an abbreviation of "Brahui Roman Likvar") was developed by the Brahui Language Board of the <a href="University%20of%20Balochistan">University of Balochistan</a> in Quetta, and adopted by the newspaper <a href="Tal%C3%A1r">Talár</a>.

Below is the new promoted Bráhuí Báşágal Brolikva orthography:

The letters with diacritics are the long vowels, post-alveolar and retroflex consonants, the voiced velar fricative and the voiceless lateral fricative.

According to a 2009 <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> report, Brahui is one of the 27 <a href="languages%20of%20Pakistan">languages of Pakistan</a> that are facing the <a href="endangered%20language">danger</a> of <a href="extinct%20language">extinction</a>. They classify it in "unsafe" status, the least endangered level out of the five levels of concern (Unsafe, Definitely Endangered, Severely Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct).

<a href="Tal%C3%A1r%20%28Newspaper%29">Talár</a> is the first daily newspaper in the Brahui language. It uses the new Roman orthography, and is "an attempt to standardize and develop [the] Brahui language to meet the requirements of modern political, social and scientific discourse."

There is no consensus as to whether Brahui is a relatively recent language introduced into Balochistan or remnant of an older widespread Dravidian language family. According to Josef Elfenbein (1989), the most common theory is that the Brahui were part of a <a href="proto-Dravidian%20people">Dravidian</a> invasion of north-western India in 3rd millennium BC, but unlike other Dravidians who migrated to the south, they remained in Sarawan and Jahlawan since before 2000 BC. However, some other scholars see it as a recent migrant language to its present region. They postulate, that Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from <a href="central%20India">central India</a> after 1000 CE. The absence of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui supports this hypothesis. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a <a href="Northwestern%20Iranian%20language">Northwestern Iranian language</a>, and moved to the area from the west only around 1000 CE. One scholar places the migration as late as the 13th or 14th century.

Berkeley DB

Berkeley DB (BDB) is a <a href="software">software</a> <a href="Library%20%28computing%29">library</a> intended to provide a high-performance <a href="embedded%20database">embedded database</a> for <a href="Key-value%20database">key/value</a> data. Berkeley DB is written in <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> with API bindings for <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>, <a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a>, <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a>, <a href="Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="PHP">PHP</a>, <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>, <a href="Ruby%20%28programming%20language%29">Ruby,</a> <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, <a href="Tcl">Tcl</a>, and many other <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s. BDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, and supports multiple data items for a single key. Berkeley DB is not a <a href="relational%20database">relational database</a>.

BDB can support thousands of simultaneous threads of control or concurrent processes manipulating databases as large as 256 terabytes, on a wide variety of <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s including most <a href="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> systems, and <a href="real-time%20operating%20system">real-time operating system</a>s. 

BDB was commercially supported and developed by <a href="Sleepycat%20Software">Sleepycat Software</a> from 1996 to 2006. This company was acquired by <a href="Oracle%20Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a> in February 2006, which continues to develop and sell Berkeley DB. Under Oracle's stewardship, "Berkeley DB" has become a common brand name for three distinct products: Oracle Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition, and Berkeley DB XML. These three products all share a common ancestry and are currently under active development.

Berkeley DB originated at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> as part of <a href="Berkeley%20Software%20Distribution">BSD</a>, Berkeley's version of the <a href="Unix">Unix</a> operating system. After 4.3BSD (1986), the BSD developers attempted to remove or replace all code originating in the original <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">AT&T</a> Unix from which BSD was derived. In doing so, they needed to rewrite the Unix database package. Seltzer and Yigit created a new database, unencumbered by any AT&T patents: an on-disk <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a> that outperformed the existing <a href="Dbm">Dbm</a> libraries. Berkeley DB itself was first released in 1991 and later included with 4.4BSD. In 1996 <a href="Netscape">Netscape</a> requested that the authors of Berkeley DB improve and extend the library, then at version 1.86, to suit Netscape's requirements for an <a href="LDAP">LDAP</a> server and for use in the <a href="Netscape%20%28web%20browser%29">Netscape browser</a>. That request led to the creation of <a href="Sleepycat%20Software">Sleepycat Software</a>. This company was acquired by <a href="Oracle%20Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a> in February 2006, which continues to develop and sell Berkeley DB.

Since its initial release, Berkeley DB has gone through various versions. Each major release cycle has introduced a single new major feature generally layering on top of the earlier features to add functionality to the product. The 1.x releases focused on managing key/value data storage and are referred to as "Data Store" (DS). The 2.x releases added a locking system enabling concurrent access to data. This is what is known as "Concurrent Data Store" (CDS). The 3.x releases added a logging system for transactions and recovery, called "Transactional Data Store" (TDS). The 4.x releases added the ability to replicate log records and create a distributed highly available single-master multi-replica database. This is called the "High Availability" (HA) feature set. Berkeley DB's evolution has sometimes led to minor API changes or log format changes, but very rarely have database formats changed. Berkeley DB HA supports online upgrades from one version to the next by maintaining the ability to read and apply the prior release's log records.

The <a href="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> operating systems continue to use Berkeley DB 1.8x for compatibility reasons; Linux-based operating systems commonly include several versions to accommodate for applications still using older interfaces/files.

Starting with the 6.0/12c releases, all Berkeley DB products are licensed under the <a href="GNU%20Affero%20General%20Public%20License">GNU AGPL</a>. Berkeley DB JE 7.3.7 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 . Previously Berkeley DB was redistributed under the 4-clause <a href="BSD%20license">BSD license</a> (before version 2.0), and the Sleepycat Public License, which is an <a href="Open%20Source%20Initiative">OSI</a>-approved <a href="open-source%20license">open-source license</a> as well as an <a href="Free%20Software%20Foundation">FSF</a>-approved <a href="free%20software%20license">free software license</a>. The product ships with complete source code, build script, test suite, and documentation. The code quality and general utility along with the licensing terms have led to its use in a multitude of <a href="free%20and%20open-source%20software">free and open-source software</a>. Those who do not wish to abide by the terms of the GNU AGPL, or use an older version with the Sleepycat Public License, have the option of purchasing another <a href="proprietary%20software%20license">proprietary license</a> for redistribution from <a href="Oracle%20Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>. This technique is called <a href="Dual%20license">dual licensing</a>. Different versions of Berkeley DB (DB, JE, XML) may have different licensing terms.

Berkeley DB includes compatibility interfaces for some historic Unix database libraries: <a href="dbm">dbm</a>, <a href="ndbm">ndbm</a> and hsearch (a <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">System V</a> library for creating in-memory <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s).

Berkeley DB has an architecture notably simpler than that of other database systems like <a href="relational%20database%20management%20system">relational database management system</a>s. For example, like <a href="SQLite">SQLite</a>, it does not provide support for network access programs access the database using in-process <a href="Application%20programming%20interface">API</a> calls. Oracle added support for SQL in 11g R2 release based on the popular SQLite API by including a version of SQLite in Berkeley DB. There is third party support for <a href="PL/SQL">PL/SQL</a> in Berkeley DB via a commercial product named <a href="StepSqlite">Metatranz StepSqlite</a>.

A program accessing the database is free to decide how the data is to be stored in a record. Berkeley DB puts no constraints on the record's data. The record and its key can both be up to four gigabytes long.

Despite having a simple architecture, Berkeley DB supports many advanced database features such as <a href="ACID">ACID</a> <a href="Database%20transaction">transactions</a>, fine-grained <a href="Lock%20%28computer%20science%29">locking</a>, hot <a href="backup">backup</a>s and <a href="replication%20%28computer%20science%29">replication</a>.

The name "Berkeley DB" is given to three different products:


Each edition has separate database libraries, despite the common branding. The first is the traditional Berkeley DB, written in C. It contains several database implementations, including a <a href="B-tree">B-tree</a> and one built around <a href="extensible%20hashing">extensible hashing</a>. It supports multiple language bindings, including C/C++, Java (via JNI), C# .NET, <a href="Perl">Perl</a> and <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>.

Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE) is a pure Java database management library. Its design resembles that of Berkeley DB without replicating it exactly, and has a feature set that includes many of those found in the traditional Berkeley DB and others that are specific to the Java Edition. It has a log structured storage architecture, which gives it different performance and concurrency characteristics. Three APIs are available a Direct Persistence Layer which is "Plain Old Java Objects" (POJO); one which is based on the Java Collections Framework (an object persistence approach); and one based on the traditional Berkeley DB API. The Berkeley DB Java Edition High Availability option (Replication) is available. Note that traditional Berkeley DB also supports a Java API, but it does so via <a href="Java%20Native%20Interface">JNI</a> and thus requires an installed native library.

The Berkeley DB XML database specializes in the storage of XML documents, supporting <a href="XQuery">XQuery</a> via <a href="XQilla">XQilla</a>. It is implemented as an additional layer on top of (a legacy version of) Berkeley DB and the <a href="Xerces">Xerces</a> library. DB XML is written in C++ and supports multiple language bindings, including C++, Java (via JNI), <a href="Perl">Perl</a> and <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>.

Berkeley DB provides the underlying storage and retrieval system of several <a href="Lightweight%20Directory%20Access%20Protocol">LDAP</a> servers, database systems, and many other proprietary and free/open source applications. Notable software that use Berkeley DB for data storage include:



Oracle Corporation makes versions 2.0 and higher of Berkeley DB available under a <a href="dual%20license">dual license</a>. The Sleepycat license is a 2-clause <a href="BSD%20license">BSD license</a> with an additional <a href="copyleft">copyleft</a> clause similar to the <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GNU GPL</a> version 2's Section 3, requiring source code of an application using Berkeley DB to be made available for a nominal fee. Oracle Berkeley DB JE 7.3.7 is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 .

<a href="Sleepycat%20License">Sleepycat License</a> (sometimes referred to as Berkeley Database License or the Sleepycat Public License) is an <a href="Open%20Source%20Initiative">OSI</a>-approved <a href="open%20source%20license">open source license</a> used by <a href="Oracle%20Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a> for the open-source editions of Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition and Berkeley DB XML embedded database products older than version 6.0.20.

Boolean satisfiability problem

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, the Boolean satisfiability problem (sometimes called Propositional Satisfiability Problem and abbreviated as SATISFIABILITY or SAT) is the problem of determining if there exists an <a href="Interpretation%20%28logic%29">interpretation</a> that <a href="Satisfiability">satisfies</a> a given <a href="Boolean%20logic">Boolean</a> <a href="Formula%20%28mathematical%20logic%29">formula</a>. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula <a href="Validity">evaluates to TRUE</a>. If this is the case, the formula is called "satisfiable". On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is <a href="Contradiction%23Contradiction%20in%20formal%20logic">FALSE</a> for all possible variable assignments and the formula is "unsatisfiable". For example, the formula ""a" AND NOT "b"" is satisfiable because one can find the values "a" = TRUE and "b" = FALSE, which make ("a" AND NOT "b") = TRUE. In contrast, ""a" AND NOT "a"" is unsatisfiable.

SAT is the first problem that was proven to be <a href="NP-complete">NP-complete</a>; see <a href="Cook%E2%80%93Levin%20theorem">Cook–Levin theorem</a>. This means that all problems in the complexity class <a href="NP%20%28complexity%29">NP</a>, which includes a wide range of natural decision and optimization problems, are at most as difficult to solve as SAT. There is no known algorithm that efficiently solves each SAT problem, and it is generally believed that no such algorithm exists; yet this belief has not been proven mathematically, and resolving the question whether SAT has a <a href="polynomial-time">polynomial-time</a> algorithm is equivalent to the <a href="P%20versus%20NP%20problem">P versus NP problem</a>, which is a famous open problem in the theory of computing.

Nevertheless, as of 2016, heuristical SAT-algorithms are able to solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and formulas consisting of millions of symbols, which is sufficient for many practical SAT problems from e.g. <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="circuit%20design">circuit design</a>, and <a href="automatic%20theorem%20proving">automatic theorem proving</a>.

A <a href="propositional%20logic">propositional logic</a> formula, also called Boolean expression, is built from <a href="Variable%20%28mathematics%29">variables</a>, operators AND (<a href="Logical%20conjunction">conjunction</a>, also denoted by ∧), OR (<a href="logical%20disjunction">disjunction</a>, ∨), NOT (<a href="negation">negation</a>, ¬), and parentheses.
A formula is said to be satisfiable if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate <a href="logical%20value">logical value</a>s (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables.
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is, given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.
This <a href="decision%20problem">decision problem</a> is of central importance in various areas of <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, including <a href="theoretical%20computer%20science">theoretical computer science</a>, <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">complexity theory</a>, <a href="algorithmics">algorithmics</a>, <a href="cryptography">cryptography</a> and <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.

There are several special cases of the Boolean satisfiability problem in which the formulas are required to have a particular structure.
A literal is either a variable, then called positive literal, or the negation of a variable, then called negative literal.
A clause is a disjunction of literals (or a single literal).
A clause is called a <a href="Horn%20clause">Horn clause</a> if it contains at most one positive literal.
A formula is in <a href="conjunctive%20normal%20form">conjunctive normal form</a> (CNF) if it is a conjunction of clauses (or a single clause).
For example, is a positive literal, is a negative literal, is a clause, and is a formula in conjunctive normal form, its 1st and 3rd clause are Horn clauses, but its 2nd clause is not. The formula is satisfiable, choosing "x" = FALSE, "x" = FALSE, and "x" arbitrarily, since (FALSE ∨ ¬FALSE) ∧ (¬FALSE ∨ FALSE ∨ "x") ∧ ¬FALSE evaluates to (FALSE ∨ TRUE) ∧ (TRUE ∨ FALSE ∨ "x") ∧ TRUE, and in turn to TRUE ∧ TRUE ∧ TRUE (i.e. to TRUE). In contrast, the CNF formula "a" ∧ ¬"a", consisting of two clauses of one literal, is unsatisfiable, since for "a"=TRUE and "a"=FALSE it evaluates to TRUE ∧ ¬TRUE (i.e. to FALSE) and FALSE ∧ ¬FALSE (i.e. again to FALSE), respectively.

For some versions of the SAT problem,

it is useful to define the notion of a generalized conjunctive normal form formula, viz. as a conjunction of arbitrarily many generalized clauses, the latter being of the form for some boolean operator "R" and (ordinary) literals . Different sets of allowed boolean operators lead to different problem versions.

As an example, "R"(¬"x","a","b") is a generalized clause, and "R"(¬"x","a","b") ∧ "R"("b","y","c") ∧ "R"("c","d",¬"z") is a generalized conjunctive normal form. This formula is used <a href="%23Exactly-1%203-satisfiability">below</a>, with "R" being the ternary operator that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is.
Using the laws of <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a>, every propositional logic formula can be transformed into an equivalent conjunctive normal form, which may, however, be exponentially longer. For example, transforming the formula
into conjunctive normal form yields
while the former is a disjunction of "n" conjunctions of 2 variables, the latter consists of 2 clauses of "n" variables.

SAT was the first known <a href="NP-complete">NP-complete</a> problem, as proved by <a href="Stephen%20Cook">Stephen Cook</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> in 1971 and independently by <a href="Leonid%20Levin">Leonid Levin</a> at the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%23The%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20the%20USSR">National Academy of Sciences</a> in 1973. Until that time, the concept of an NP-complete problem did not even exist.
The proof shows how every decision problem in the <a href="complexity%20class">complexity class</a> <a href="NP%20%28complexity%29">NP</a> can be <a href="reduction%20%28complexity%29">reduced</a> to the SAT problem for CNF formulas, sometimes called CNFSAT.
A useful property of Cook's reduction is that it preserves the number of accepting answers. For example, deciding whether a given <a href="Graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29">graph</a> has a <a href="Graph%20coloring%23Vertex%20coloring">3-coloring</a> is another problem in NP; if a graph has 17 valid 3-colorings, the SAT formula produced by the Cook–Levin reduction will have 17 satisfying assignments.

NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances. Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly. See <a href="%23Algorithms%20for%20solving%20SAT">Algorithms for solving SAT</a> below.

SAT is trivial if the formulas are restricted to those in <a href="disjunctive%20normal%20form">disjunctive normal form</a>, that is, they are disjunction of conjunctions of literals. Such a formula is indeed satisfiable if and only if at least one of its conjunctions is satisfiable, and a conjunction is satisfiable if and only if it does not contain both "x" and NOT "x" for some variable "x". This can be checked in linear time. Furthermore, if they are restricted to being in full disjunctive normal form, in which every variable appears exactly once in every conjunction, they can be checked in constant time (each conjunction represents one satisfying assignment). But it can take exponential time and space to convert a general SAT problem to disjunctive normal form; for an example exchange "∧" and "∨" in the <a href="%23Basic%20definitions%20and%20terminology">above</a> exponential blow-up example for conjunctive normal forms.

Like the satisfiability problem for arbitrary formulas, determining the satisfiability of a formula in conjunctive normal form where each clause is limited to at most three literals is NP-complete also; this problem is called 3-SAT, 3CNFSAT, or 3-satisfiability.
To reduce the unrestricted SAT problem to 3-SAT, transform each clause to a conjunction of "n" − 2 clauses
where are fresh variables not occurring elsewhere.
Although the two formulas are not <a href="logically%20equivalent">logically equivalent</a>, they are <a href="equisatisfiable">equisatisfiable</a>. The formula resulting from transforming all clauses is at most 3 times as long as its original, i.e. the length growth is polynomial.

3-SAT is one of <a href="Karp%27s%2021%20NP-complete%20problems">Karp's 21 NP-complete problems</a>, and it is used as a starting point for proving that other problems are also <a href="NP-hard">NP-hard</a>. This is done by <a href="polynomial-time%20reduction">polynomial-time reduction</a> from 3-SAT to the other problem. An example of a problem where this method has been used is the <a href="clique%20problem">clique problem</a>: given a CNF formula consisting of "c" clauses, the corresponding <a href="Graph%20%28discrete%20mathematics%29">graph</a> consists of a vertex for each literal, and an edge between each two non-contradicting literals from different clauses, cf. picture. The graph has a "c"-clique if and only if the formula is satisfiable.

There is a simple randomized algorithm due to Schöning (1999) that runs in time (4/3) where "n" is the number of variables in the 3-SAT proposition, and succeeds with high probability to correctly decide 3-SAT.

The <a href="exponential%20time%20hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a> asserts that no algorithm can solve 3-SAT (or indeed "k"-SAT for any "k > 2") in time that is fundamentally faster than .

Selman, Mitchell, and Levesque (1996) give empirical data on the difficulty of randomly generated 3-SAT formulas, depending on their size parameters.
Difficulty is measured in number recursive calls made by a <a href="%23Algorithms%20for%20solving%20SAT">DPLL algorithm</a>.

3-satisfiability can be generalized to k-satisfiability (k-SAT, also k-CNF-SAT), when formulas in CNF are considered with each clause containing up to "k" literals.
However, since for any "k"≥3, this problem can neither be easier than 3-SAT nor harder than SAT, and the latter two are NP-complete, so must be k-SAT.

Some authors restrict k-SAT to CNF formulas with exactly k literals. This doesn't lead to a different complexity class either, as each clause with "j"<"k" literals can be padded with fixed dummy variables to
After padding all clauses, 2-1 extra clauses have to be appended to ensure that only can lead to a satisfying assignment. Since "k" doesn't depend on the formula length, the extra clauses lead to a constant increase in length. For the same reason, it does not matter whether duplicate literals are allowed in clauses (like e.g. ), or not.

A variant of the 3-satisfiability problem is the one-in-three 3-SAT (also known variously as 1-in-3-SAT and exactly-1 3-SAT).
Given a conjunctive normal form, the problem is to determine whether there exists a truth assignment to the variables so that each clause has "exactly" one TRUE literal (and thus exactly two FALSE literals). In contrast, ordinary 3-SAT requires that every clause has "at least" one TRUE literal.
Formally, a one-in-three 3-SAT problem is given as a generalized conjunctive normal form with all generalized clauses using a ternary operator "R" that is TRUE just if exactly one of its arguments is. When all literals of a one-in-three 3-SAT formula are positive, the satisfiability problem is called one-in-three positive 3-SAT.

One-in-three 3-SAT, together with its positive case, is listed as NP-complete problem "LO4" in the standard reference, "Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness"
by <a href="Michael%20R.%20Garey">Michael R. Garey</a> and <a href="David%20S.%20Johnson">David S. Johnson</a>. One-in-three 3-SAT was proved to be NP-complete by <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Schaefer">Thomas J. Schaefer</a> as a special case of <a href="Schaefer%27s%20dichotomy%20theorem">Schaefer's dichotomy theorem</a>, which asserts that any problem generalizing Boolean satisfiability in a certain way is either in the class P or is NP-complete.

Schaefer gives a construction allowing an easy polynomial-time reduction from 3-SAT to one-in-three 3-SAT. Let "("x" or "y" or "z")" be a clause in a 3CNF formula. Add six fresh boolean variables "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f", to be used to simulate this clause and no other.

Then the formula "R"("x","a","d") ∧ "R"("y","b","d") ∧ "R"("a","b","e") ∧ "R"("c","d","f") ∧ "R"("z","c",FALSE) is satisfiable by some setting of the fresh variables if and only if at least one of "x", "y", or "z" is TRUE, see picture (left). Thus any 3-SAT instance with "m" clauses and "n" variables may be converted into an <a href="equisatisfiable">equisatisfiable</a> one-in-three 3-SAT instance with 5"m" clauses and "n"+6"m" variables.
Another reduction involves only four fresh variables and three clauses: "R"(¬"x","a","b") ∧ "R"("b","y","c") ∧ R("c","d",¬"z"), see picture (right).

SAT is easier if the number of literals in a clause is limited to at most 2, in which case the problem is called <a href="2-SAT">2-SAT</a>. This problem can be solved in polynomial time, and in fact is <a href="NL-complete">complete</a> for the complexity class <a href="NL%20%28complexity%29">NL</a>. If additionally all OR operations in literals are changed to <a href="Exclusive%20or">XOR</a> operations, the result is called exclusive-or 2-satisfiability, which is a problem complete for the complexity class <a href="SL%20%28complexity%29">SL</a> = <a href="L%20%28complexity%29">L</a>.

The problem of deciding the satisfiability of a given conjunction of Horn clauses is called Horn-satisfiability, or HORN-SAT.
It can be solved in polynomial time by a single step of the <a href="Unit%20propagation">Unit propagation</a> algorithm, which produces the single minimal model of the set of Horn clauses (w.r.t. the set of literals assigned to TRUE).
Horn-satisfiability is <a href="P-complete">P-complete</a>. It can be seen as <a href="P%20%28complexity%29">P's</a> version of the Boolean satisfiability problem.
Also, deciding the truth of quantified Horn formulas can be done in polynomial time.
Horn clauses are of interest because they are able to express <a href="Entailment">implication</a> of one variable from a set of other variables. Indeed, one such clause ¬"x" ∨ ... ∨ ¬"x" ∨ "y" can be rewritten as "x" ∧ ... ∧ "x" → "y", that is, if "x"...,"x" are all TRUE, then "y" needs to be TRUE as well.

A generalization of the class of Horn formulae is that of renamable-Horn formulae, which is the set of formulae that can be placed in Horn form by replacing some variables with their respective negation.
For example, ("x" ∨ ¬"x") ∧ (¬"x" ∨ "x" ∨ "x") ∧ ¬"x" is not a Horn formula, but can be renamed to the Horn formula ("x" ∨ ¬"x") ∧ (¬"x" ∨ "x" ∨ ¬"y") ∧ ¬"x" by introducing "y" as negation of "x".
In contrast, no renaming of ("x" ∨ ¬"x" ∨ ¬"x") ∧ (¬"x" ∨ "x" ∨ "x") ∧ ¬"x" leads to a Horn formula.
Checking the existence of such a replacement can be done in linear time; therefore, the satisfiability of such formulae is in P as it can be solved by first performing this replacement and then checking the satisfiability of the resulting Horn formula.

Another special case is the class of problems where each clause contains XOR (i.e. <a href="exclusive%20or">exclusive or</a>) rather than (plain) OR operators.
This is in <a href="P%20%28complexity%20class%29">P</a>, since an XOR-SAT formula can also be viewed as a system of linear equations mod 2, and can be solved in cubic time by <a href="Gaussian%20elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>; see the box for an example. This recast is based on the <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29%23Boolean%20rings">kinship between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings</a>, and the fact that arithmetic modulo two forms a <a href="finite%20field">finite field</a>. Since "a" XOR "b" XOR "c" evaluates to TRUE if and only if exactly 1 or 3 members of {"a","b","c"} are TRUE, each solution of the 1-in-3-SAT problem for a given CNF formula is also a solution of the XOR-3-SAT problem, and in turn each solution of XOR-3-SAT is a solution of 3-SAT, cf. picture. As a consequence, for each CNF formula, it is possible to solve the XOR-3-SAT problem defined by the formula, and based on the result infer either that the 3-SAT problem is solvable or that the 1-in-3-SAT problem is unsolvable.

Provided that the <a href="P%20%3D%20NP%20problem">complexity classes P and NP are not equal</a>, neither 2-, nor Horn-, nor XOR-satisfiability is NP-complete, unlike SAT.

The restrictions above (CNF, 2CNF, 3CNF, Horn, XOR-SAT) bound the considered formulae to be conjunctions of subformulae; each restriction states a specific form for all subformulae: for example, only binary clauses can be subformulae in 2CNF.

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem states that, for any restriction to Boolean operators that can be used to form these subformulae, the corresponding satisfiability problem is in P or NP-complete. The membership in P of the satisfiability of 2CNF, Horn, and XOR-SAT formulae are special cases of this theorem.

An extension that has gained significant popularity since 2003 is <a href="Satisfiability%20modulo%20theories">Satisfiability modulo theories</a> (SMT) that can enrich CNF formulas with linear constraints, arrays, all-different constraints, <a href="uninterpreted%20function">uninterpreted function</a>s, "etc." Such extensions typically remain NP-complete, but very efficient solvers are now available that can handle many such kinds of constraints.

The satisfiability problem becomes more difficult if both "for all" (<a href="%E2%88%80">∀</a>) and "there exists" (<a href="%E2%88%83">∃</a>) <a href="Quantifier%20%28logic%29">quantifier</a>s are allowed to bind the Boolean variables.
An example of such an expression would be ; it is valid, since for all values of "x" and "y", an appropriate value of "z" can be found, viz. "z"=TRUE if both "x" and "y" are FALSE, and "z"=FALSE else.
SAT itself (tacitly) uses only ∃ quantifiers.
If only ∀ quantifiers are allowed instead, the so-called <a href="Tautology%20%28logic%29">tautology</a> problem is obtained, which is <a href="co-NP-complete">co-NP-complete</a>.
If both quantifiers are allowed, the problem is called the <a href="quantified%20Boolean%20formula%20problem">quantified Boolean formula problem</a> (QBF), which can be shown to be <a href="PSPACE-complete">PSPACE-complete</a>. It is widely believed that PSPACE-complete problems are strictly harder than any problem in NP, although this has not yet been proved. Using highly parallel "<a href="P%20system">P system</a>s", QBF-SAT problems can be solved in linear time.

Ordinary SAT asks if there is at least one variable assignment that makes the formula true. A variety of variants deal with the number of such assignments:

Other generalizations include satisfiability for <a href="first-order%20predicate%20calculus">first</a>- and <a href="second-order%20logic">second-order logic</a>, <a href="constraint%20satisfaction%20problem">constraint satisfaction problem</a>s, <a href="0-1%20integer%20programming">0-1 integer programming</a>.

The SAT problem is self-reducible, that is, each algorithm which correctly answers if an instance of SAT is solvable can be used to find a satisfying assignment. First, the question is asked on the given formula Φ. If the answer is "no", the formula is unsatisfiable. Otherwise, the question is asked on the partly instantiated formula Φ<a href="substitution%20%28logic%29">{"x"=TRUE}</a>, i.e. Φ with the first variable "x" replaced by TRUE, and simplified accordingly. If the answer is "yes", then "x"=TRUE, otherwise "x"=FALSE. Values of other variables can be found subsequently in the same way. In total, "n"+1 runs of the algorithm are required, where "n" is the number of distinct variables in Φ.

This property of self-reducibility is used in several theorems in complexity theory:

Since the SAT problem is NP-complete, only algorithms with exponential worst-case complexity are known for it. In spite of this, efficient and scalable algorithms for SAT were developed over the last decade and have contributed to dramatic advances in our ability to automatically solve problem instances involving tens of thousands of variables and millions of constraints (i.e. clauses). Examples of such problems in <a href="electronic%20design%20automation">electronic design automation</a> (EDA) include <a href="formal%20equivalence%20checking">formal equivalence checking</a>, <a href="model%20checking">model checking</a>, <a href="formal%20verification">formal verification</a> of <a href="microprocessor">pipelined microprocessors</a>, <a href="automatic%20test%20pattern%20generation">automatic test pattern generation</a>, <a href="routing%20%28electronic%20design%20automation%29">routing</a> of <a href="FPGA">FPGA</a>s, <a href="Automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">planning</a>, and <a href="Scheduling%20algorithm">scheduling problems</a>, and so on. A SAT-solving engine is now considered to be an essential component in the <a href="electronic%20design%20automation">EDA</a> toolbox.

There are two classes of high-performance <a href="algorithms">algorithms</a> for solving instances of SAT in practice: the <a href="Conflict-Driven%20Clause%20Learning">Conflict-Driven Clause Learning</a> algorithm, which can be viewed as a modern variant of the <a href="DPLL%20algorithm">DPLL algorithm</a> (well known implementations include <a href="Chaff%20algorithm">Chaff</a> and <a href="GRASP%20%28SAT%20solver%29">GRASP</a>) and <a href="stochastic%20local%20search%20algorithm">stochastic</a> <a href="Local%20search%20%28constraint%20satisfaction%29">local search</a> algorithms, such as <a href="WalkSAT">WalkSAT</a>.

A DPLL SAT solver employs a systematic backtracking search procedure to explore the (exponentially sized) space of variable assignments looking for satisfying assignments. The basic search procedure was proposed in two seminal papers in the early 1960s (see references below) and is now commonly referred to as the <a href="Davis%E2%80%93Putnam%E2%80%93Logemann%E2%80%93Loveland%20algorithm">Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland algorithm</a> ("DPLL" or "DLL"). Theoretically, exponential lower bounds have been proved for the DPLL family of algorithms.

In contrast, randomized algorithms like the PPSZ algorithm by Paturi, Pudlak, Saks, and Zane set variables in a random order according to some heuristics, for example bounded-width <a href="Resolution%20%28logic%29">resolution</a>. If the heuristic can't find the correct setting, the variable is assigned randomly. The PPSZ algorithm has a runtime of formula_1 for 3-SAT with a single satisfying assignment. Currently this is the best-known runtime for this problem. In the setting with many satisfying assignments the randomized algorithm by Schöning has a better bound.

Modern SAT solvers (developed in the last ten years) come in two flavors: "conflict-driven" and "look-ahead". Conflict-driven solvers augment the basic DPLL search algorithm with efficient conflict analysis, clause learning, non-<a href="chronological%20backtracking">chronological backtracking</a> (a.k.a. <a href="backjumping">backjumping</a>), as well as <a href="%26quot%3Btwo-watched-literals%26quot%3B%20unit%20propagation">"two-watched-literals" unit propagation</a>, adaptive branching, and random restarts. These "extras" to the basic systematic search have been empirically shown to be essential for handling the large SAT instances that arise in <a href="electronic%20design%20automation">electronic design automation</a> (EDA). Look-ahead solvers have especially strengthened reductions (going beyond unit-clause propagation) and the heuristics, and they are generally stronger than conflict-driven solvers on hard instances (while conflict-driven solvers can be much better on large instances which actually have an easy instance inside).

Modern SAT solvers are also having significant impact on the fields of software verification, constraint solving in artificial intelligence, and operations research, among others. Powerful solvers are readily available as <a href="free%20and%20open%20source%20software">free and open source software</a>. In particular, the conflict-driven <a href="http%3A//minisat.se/">MiniSAT</a>, which was relatively successful at the <a href="http%3A//www.satcompetition.org/">2005 SAT competition</a>, only has about 600 lines of code. A modern Parallel SAT solver is <a href="http%3A//www.cril.univ-artois.fr/%7Ejabbour/manysat.htm">ManySAT</a>. It can achieve super linear speed-ups on important classes of problems. An example for look-ahead solvers is <a href="http%3A//www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/sat/march_dl.php">march_dl</a>, which won a prize at the <a href="http%3A//www.satcompetition.org/">2007 SAT competition</a>.

Certain types of large random satisfiable instances of SAT can be solved by <a href="survey%20propagation">survey propagation</a> (SP). Particularly in <a href="hardware%20design">hardware design</a> and <a href="hardware%20verification">verification</a> applications, satisfiability and other logical properties of a given propositional formula are sometimes decided based on a representation of the formula as a <a href="binary%20decision%20diagram">binary decision diagram</a> (BDD).

Almost all SAT solvers include time-outs, so they will terminate in reasonable time even if they cannot find a solution.
Different SAT solvers will find different instances easy or hard, and some excel at proving unsatisfiability, and others at finding solutions.
All of these behaviors can be seen in the SAT solving contests.

Bohemian

A Bohemian () is a resident of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, a region of the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> or the former <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>, a region of the former Crown of Bohemia (<a href="lands%20of%20the%20Bohemian%20Crown">lands of the Bohemian Crown</a>). In English, the word "Bohemian" was used to denote the <a href="Czech%20people">Czech people</a> as well as the <a href="Czech%20language">Czech language</a> before the word "Czech" became prevalent in the early 20th century.

In a separate meaning, "Bohemian" may also denote "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts" according to <a href="OxfordDictionaries.com">Oxford Dictionaries Online</a>. (See <a href="Bohemianism">Bohemianism</a>).

The name "Bohemia" derives from the name of the <a href="Boii">Boii</a>, a <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> tribe who inhabited that area towards the later <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne%20period">La Tène period</a>. The toponym "Boiohaemum," first attested by <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, is commonly taken to mean "home of the Boii" (from the <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Germanic</a> root *"haima-" meaning "world, home"). The word "Bohemian" has never been widely used by the local Czech population. In <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a>, the region since the early Middle Ages has been called "Čechy" but also, especially during the period of restoration/emancipation of the Czech language and nation, as "Čechie." Another term, stressing the importance of the state/nation, is "Království české" ("Czech Kingdom") in Czech, or "Böhmen" (Königreich) in German. Its mainly Czech-speaking inhabitants were called "Čechové" (in modern Czech "Češi").

In most other Western European vernaculars and in Latin (as "Bohemi"), the word "Bohemian" or a derivate was used. If the Czech ethnic origin was to be stressed, combinations such as "Bohemian of Bohemian language" ("Čech českého jazyka"), "a real Bohemian" ("pravý Čech"), etc. were used.

It was not until the 19th century that other European languages began to use words related to "Czechs" (as in English, "Tschechen" in <a href="German%20language">German</a>, "Tchèques" in <a href="French%20language">French</a>) in a deliberate (and successful) attempt to distinguish between ethnic Slavic-speaking Bohemians and other inhabitants of Bohemia. The latter were mostly <a href="ethnic%20Germans">ethnic Germans</a>, who identified as "German Bohemians" ("Deutschböhmen") or simply as "Bohemians" ("Böhmen"). In many parts of Europe, state citizenship was not identical with ethnicity and language, and the various peoples were usually identified by their language. Ethnic boundaries in Bohemia were not always sharp, and people very often were bilingual. Intermarriages across language borders were also common. Native Czech speakers often spoke German and many native German speakers spoke Czech with varying fluency, particularly in areas with many Czech speakers.

Currently, the word "Bohemians" is sometimes used when speaking about persons from Bohemia of all ethnic origins, especially before the year 1918, when the Kingdom of Bohemia ceased to exist. It is also used to distinguish between inhabitants of the western part (Bohemia proper) of the state, and the eastern (<a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>) or north-eastern (<a href="Czech%20Silesia">Silesia</a>) parts.

The term "<a href="Bohemianism">Bohemianism</a>" was associated with "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts", that comes from the French "bohémien.".

Bob Jones University

Bob Jones University (BJU) is a <a href="Private%20university">private</a>, non-denominational <a href="Protestantism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Protestant</a> university in <a href="Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Greenville</a>, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, United States, known for its <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservative</a> cultural and religious positions. It has approximately 2,800 students, and it is accredited by the <a href="Southern%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges</a> (SACSCOC) and the <a href="Transnational%20Association%20of%20Christian%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a>. In 2008, the university estimated the number of its graduates at 35,000, in 2017, 40,000. The university's athletic teams, the Bruins, compete in Division II of the <a href="National%20Christian%20College%20Athletic%20Association">National Christian College Athletic Association</a> (NCCAA).

During the <a href="The%20Fundamentalist-Modernist%20Controversy">Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy</a> of the 1920s, Christian evangelist <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Sr.">Bob Jones, Sr.</a> grew increasingly concerned about the secularization of higher education and the influence of religious liberalism in denominational colleges. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in <a href="Winona%20Lake%2C%20Indiana">Winona Lake, Indiana</a>, and said, "If schools and colleges do not quit teaching <a href="evolution">evolution</a> as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists." While he himself was not a college graduate, Jones grew determined to found a college, and on September 12, 1927, he opened Bob Jones College in <a href="Panama%20City%2C%20Florida">Panama City</a>, with 88 students. Jones said that although he had been averse to naming the school after himself, his friends overcame his reluctance "with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people."

Bob Jones took no salary from the college and helped support the school with personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The <a href="Florida%20land%20boom">Florida land boom</a> had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> and its move to <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee">Cleveland, Tennessee</a> in 1933. However, Jones's move to Cleveland proved extraordinarily advantageous. Bankrupt at the nadir of the Depression, without a home, and with barely enough money to move its library and office furniture, the college became in thirteen years the largest <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> college in Tennessee. With the enactment of <a href="GI%20Bill">GI Bill</a> at the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the college was virtually forced to seek a new location and build a new campus.

Though he had served as Acting President as early as 1934, Jones' son, <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> officially became the school's second president in 1947 just before the college moved to <a href="Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Greenville, South Carolina</a>, and became Bob Jones University. In Greenville, the university more than doubled in size within two years and started its own radio station, film department, and art gallery—the latter of which eventually became one of the largest collections of religious art in the Western Hemisphere.

During the late 1950s, BJU and alumnus <a href="Billy%20Graham%20%28evangelist%29">Billy Graham</a>, who had attended Bob Jones College for one semester and received an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> from the university in 1948, engaged in a controversy about the propriety of theological conservatives cooperating with theological liberals to support evangelistic campaigns, a controversy that widened an already growing rift between separatist fundamentalists and other evangelicals. Negative publicity caused by the dispute precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956–59, and seven members of the university board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself and two of his staff members. When, in 1966, Graham held his only American campaign in Greenville, the university forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending under penalty of expulsion. Enrollment quickly rebounded, and by 1970, there were 3300 students, approximately 60% more than in 1958.

In 1971, <a href="Bob%20Jones%20III">Bob Jones III</a> became president at age 32, though his father, with the title of Chancellor, continued to exercise considerable administrative authority into the late 1990s. At the 2005 commencement, Stephen Jones was installed as the fourth president, and Bob Jones III assumed the title of chancellor. Stephen Jones resigned in 2014 for health reasons, and <a href="Steve%20Pettit">Steve Pettit</a> was named president, the first unrelated to the Jones family.

In December 2011, in response to accusations of mishandling of student reports of sexual abuse (most of which had occurred in their home churches when the students were minors) and a concurrent reporting issue at a church pastored by a university board member, the BJU board of trustees hired an independent ombudsman, GRACE (<a href="Godly%20Response%20to%20Abuse%20in%20the%20Christian%20Environment">Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment</a>), to investigate. Released in December 2014, the GRACE report suggested that BJU had discouraged students from reporting past sexual abuse, and though the University declined to implement many of the report's recommendations, President Steve Pettit formally apologized "to those who felt they did not receive from us genuine love, compassion, understanding, and support after suffering sexual abuse or assault. We did not live up to your expectations. We failed to uphold and honor our own core values. We are deeply saddened to hear that we added to the pain and suffering."

In 2011, the university became a member of the <a href="Transnational%20Association%20of%20Christian%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a> (TRACS) and reinstated intercollegiate athletics. In 2013, it replaced the "BJ" logo that had been used since 1967 with a new shield logo based on the university crest. In March 2017 the university regained its federal tax exemption after a complicated restructuring divided the organization into for-profit and non-profit entities, and in June it was granted accreditation by the <a href="Southern%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.

Although BJU had admitted Asians and other ethnic groups from its inception, it did not enroll Africans or African-American students until 1971. From 1971 to 1975, BJU admitted only married blacks, although the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) had already determined in 1970 that "private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies" were not entitled to federal tax exemption. In 1975, the University Board of Trustees authorized a change in policy to admit black students, a move that occurred shortly before the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in "<a href="Runyon%20v.%20McCrary">Runyon v. McCrary</a>" (427 U.S. 160 [1976]), which prohibited racial exclusion in private schools. However, in May of that year, BJU expanded rules against interracial dating and marriage.

In 1976, the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> revoked the university's tax exemption retroactively to December 1, 1970 on grounds that it was practicing racial discrimination. The case eventually was heard by the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> in 1982. After BJU lost the decision in "<a href="Bob%20Jones%20University%20v.%20United%20States">Bob Jones University v. United States</a>" (461 U.S. 574)[1983], the university chose to maintain its interracial dating policy and pay a million dollars in back taxes. The year following the Court decision, contributions to the university declined by 13 percent. In 2000, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> to the university, Bob Jones III dropped the university's interracial dating rule, announcing the change on <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s "<a href="Larry%20King%20Live">Larry King Live</a>". In the same year, Bob Jones III drew criticism when he reposted a letter on the university's web page referring to <a href="Mormons">Mormons</a> and <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> as being members of "cults which call themselves Christian".

In 2005, <a href="Stephen%20Jones%20%28administrator%29">Stephen Jones</a>, great-grandson of the founder, became BJU's president on the same day that he received his <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> from the school. Bob Jones III then took the title Chancellor. In 2008, the university declared itself "profoundly sorry" for having allowed "institutional policies to remain in place that were racially hurtful". That year BJU enrolled students from fifty states and nearly fifty countries, representing diverse ethnicities and cultures, and the BJU administration declared itself "committed to maintaining on the campus the racial and cultural diversity and harmony characteristic of the true Church of Jesus Christ throughout the world".

In his first meeting with the University cabinet in 2014, the fifth president <a href="Steve%20Pettit">Steve Pettit</a> said he believed it was appropriate for BJU to regain its tax-exempt status because BJU no longer held its earlier positions about race. "The Bible is clear," said Pettit, "We are made of one blood." By February 17, 2017, the IRS website had listed the university as a <a href="501%28c%29%283%29%20organization">501(c)(3) organization</a>, and by May of the same year, BJU had forged a working relationship with Greenville's <a href="Phillis%20Wheatley">Phillis Wheatley</a> Center.

As a twelve-year-old, Bob Jones, Sr. made a twenty-minute speech in defense of the <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populist Party</a>. Jones was a friend and admirer of <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> but also campaigned throughout the South for <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> (and against <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a>) during the 1928 presidential election. Even the authorized history of BJU notes that both Bob Jones, Sr. and Bob Jones, Jr. “played political hardball” when dealing with the three municipalities in which the school was successively located. For instance, in 1962, Bob Jones, Sr. warned the Greenville City Council that he had “four hundred votes in his pocket and in any election he would have control over who would be elected.” 

Bob Jones, Sr.'s April 17, 1960, <a href="Easter%20Sunday">Easter Sunday</a> sermon, broadcast on the radio, entitled "Is Segregation Scriptural?" served as the University position paper on race in the 60s, 70s and 80s. The transcript was sent in pamphlet form in fund-raising letters and sold in the University book store. In the sermon, Jones states "If you are against segregation and against racial separation, then you are against God Almighty." The school began a long history of supporting politicians who were considered aligned with racial segregation.

From nearly the inception of Bob Jones College, a majority of students and faculty were from the <a href="Northern%20United%20States%23Historical%20term">northern United States</a>, where there was a larger ratio of Republicans to Democrats than in <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a> (which was <a href="Solid%20South">solidly</a> Democratic). Therefore, almost from its founding year, BJU had a larger portion of Republicans than the surrounding community. After South Carolina Senator <a href="Strom%20Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> switched his allegiance to the Republican Party in 1964, BJU faculty members became increasingly influential in the new state Republican party, and BJU alumni were elected to local political and party offices. In 1976, candidates supported by BJU faculty and alumni captured the local Republican party with unfortunate short-term political consequences, but by 1980 the <a href="Christian%20right">religious right</a> and the <a href="country%20club%20Republican">"country club" Republicans</a> had joined forces. From then on, most Republican candidates for local and statewide offices sought the endorsement of Bob Jones III and greeted faculty/staff voters at the University Dining Common.

National Republicans soon followed. <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> spoke at the school in 1980, although the Joneses supported his opponent, <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a>, in the South Carolina primary. Later, Bob Jones III denounced Reagan as "a traitor to God's people" for choosing <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>—whom Jones called a "devil"—as his vice president. Even later, Jones III shook Bush's hand and thanked him for being a good president. In the 1990s, other Republicans such as <a href="Dan%20Quayle">Dan Quayle</a>, <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>, <a href="Phil%20Gramm">Phil Gramm</a>, <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Keyes">Alan Keyes</a> also spoke at BJU. Democrats were rarely invited to speak at the university, in part because they took political and social positions (especially support for <a href="abortion%20rights">abortion rights</a>) opposed by the <a href="Christian%20right">Religious Right</a>.

On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as candidate for President, spoke during school's chapel hour. Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific reference to the university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating his opposition to the university's anti-Catholicism. (The <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> campaign targeted Catholics with a "Catholic Voter Alert," phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal <a href="John%20Joseph%20O%27Connor">John Joseph O'Connor</a> of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York">New York</a> for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-<a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that...I wish I had gotten up then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone." Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> had fathered an <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a> child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, and later <a href="push%20poll">push poll</a>ing also implied that the child was biracial.)

Although the March 2007 issue of "<a href="Foreign%20Policy">Foreign Policy</a>" listed BJU as one of "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites" because of its past influence on American politics, BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, "It would not be my choice." Further, when asked if he felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, "The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture." In a 2005 "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by "some of the more vitriolic comments" made by his predecessors. "I don't want to get specific," he said, "But there were things said back then that I wouldn't say today." In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as "a private citizen," endorsed <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones made it clear that he wished "to stay out of politics" and that neither he nor the university had endorsed anyone. Despite a hotly contested South Carolina primary, none of the candidates appeared on the platform of BJU's Founders' Memorial Amphitorium during the 2008 election cycle. In April 2008 Stephen Jones told a reporter, "I don't think I have a political bone in my body."

In 2015 BJU reemerged as campaign stop of significance for conservative Republicans. <a href="Ben%20Carson">Ben Carson</a> and <a href="Ted%20Cruz">Ted Cruz</a> held large on-campus rallies on two successive days in November; and BJU president <a href="Steve%20Pettit">Steve Pettit</a> met with <a href="Marco%20Rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, <a href="Rick%20Perry">Rick Perry</a>, <a href="Mike%20Huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a>, and <a href="Scott%20Walker%20%28politician%29">Scott Walker</a>. <a href="Jeb%20Bush">Jeb Bush</a>, Carson, Cruz, and Rubio also appeared at a 2016 Republican presidential forum at BJU. Chip Felkel, a Greenville Republican consultant, noted that some of the candidates closely identified "with the folks at Bob Jones. So it makes sense for them to want to be there." Nevertheless, unlike BJU's earlier periods of political involvement, Pettit did not endorse a candidate.

According to <a href="Furman%20University">Furman University</a> political science professor Jim Guth, because Greenville has grown so much recently, it is unlikely BJU will ever again have the same political influence it had between the 1960s and the 1980s. Nevertheless, about a quarter of all BJU graduates continue to live in the <a href="Upstate%20South%20Carolina">Upstate</a>, and as long-time mayor <a href="Knox%20H.%20White">Knox White</a> has said, "The alumni have had a big impact on every profession and walk of life in Greenville."

The university occupies 205 acres at the eastern city limit of Greenville. The institution moved into its initial 25 buildings during the 1947–48 school year, and later buildings were also faced with the light yellow brick chosen for the originals.

<a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> was a connoisseur of European art and began collecting after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> on about $30,000 a year authorized by the University Board of Directors. Jones first concentrated on the <a href="Baroque%20painting">Italian Baroque</a>, a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive in the years immediately following the war. Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons. The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.
Not surprisingly, the gallery is especially strong in Baroque paintings and includes notable works by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>, <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Veronese</a>, <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Cranach</a>, <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a>, <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Murillo">Murillo</a>, <a href="Mattia%20Preti">Mattia Preti</a>, <a href="Jusepe%20de%20Ribera">Ribera</a>, <a href="van%20Dyck">van Dyck</a>, and <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>. Included in the Museum & Gallery collection are seven very large canvases, part of a series by <a href="Benjamin%20West">Benjamin West</a> painted for <a href="George%20III">George III</a>, called "The Progress of Revealed Religion", which are displayed in the War Memorial Chapel. (<a href="Baroque%20painting">Baroque art</a> was created during—and often for—the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> and so, ironically, BJU has been criticized by some other fundamentalists for promoting "false Catholic doctrine" through its art gallery.)

After the death of Bob Jones, Jr., Erin Jones, the wife of BJU president Stephen Jones, became director. According to David Steel, curator of European art at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Museum%20of%20Art">North Carolina Museum of Art</a>, Erin Jones "brought that museum into the modern era", employing "a top-notch curator, John Nolan", and following "best practices in conservation and restoration". The museum now regularly cooperates with other institutions, lending works for outside shows such as a Rembrandt exhibit in 2011.

Each Easter season, the university and the Museum & Gallery present the "Living Gallery", a series of <a href="tableaux%20vivants">tableaux vivants</a> recreating noted works of religious art using live models disguised as part of two-dimensional paintings.

In 2008, the BJU Museum & Gallery opened a satellite location, the "Museum & Gallery at Heritage Green" near downtown Greenville, which featured rotating exhibitions from the main museum as well as interactive children's activities. In February 2017, the Museum & Gallery closed the satellite location permanently and closed the campus location indefinitely for a major renovation of the exhibit space.

The Mack Library (named for <a href="John%20Sephus%20Mack">John Sephus Mack</a>) holds a collection of more than 300,000 books and includes seating for 1,200 as well as a computer lab and a computer classroom. (Its ancillary, a music library, is included in the Gustafson Fine Arts Center.) Mack Library's Special Collections includes an American <a href="Hymnody">Hymnody</a> Collection of about 700 titles. The "Jerusalem Chamber" is a replica of the room in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> in which work on the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of the Bible was conducted, and it displays a collection of rare Bibles. An adjoining Memorabilia Room commemorates the life of <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Sr.">Bob Jones, Sr.</a> and the history of the University.

The library's Fundamentalism File collects periodical articles and ephemera about social and religious matters of interest to evangelicals and fundamentalists. The university Archives holds copies of all university publications, <a href="oral%20histories">oral histories</a> of faculty and staff members, surviving remnants of university correspondence, and pictures and artifacts related to the Jones family and the history of the university.

The university consists of seven colleges and schools that offer more than 60 undergraduate majors, including fourteen associate degree programs. Given that BJU's faculty is untenured, most University employees consider their positions as much ministries as jobs. It is common for retiring professors to have served the university for thirty, forty, and even occasionally, fifty years, a circumstance that has contributed to the stability and conservatism of an institution of higher learning that has virtually no endowment and at which faculty salaries are "sacrificial".

The School of Religion includes majors for both men and women, although only men train as ministerial students. Many of these students go on to a <a href="seminary">seminary</a> after completing their undergraduate degree. Others take ministry positions straight from college, and rising juniors participate in a church internship program to prepare them for the pastoral ministry. In 1995 there were 1,290 BJU graduates serving as senior or associate pastors in churches across the United States. In 2017 more than 100 pastors in the <a href="Upstate%20South%20Carolina">Upstate</a> alone were BJU graduates.
The university requires use of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. The <a href="King-James-Only%20Movement">King-James-Only Movement</a>—or more correctly, movements, since it has many variations—became a divisive force in fundamentalism only as conservative modern Bible translations, such as the <a href="New%20American%20Standard%20Bible">New American Standard Bible</a> (NASB) and the <a href="New%20International%20Version">New International Version</a> (NIV), began to appear in the 1970s. BJU has taken the position that orthodox Christians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries (including fundamentalists) agreed that while the KJV was a substantially accurate translation, only the original manuscripts of the Bible written in Hebrew and Greek were infallible and inerrant. Bob Jones, Jr. called the KJV-only position a "<a href="heresy">heresy</a>" and "in a very definite sense, a <a href="blasphemy">blasphemy</a>".

The Division of Fine Arts has the largest faculty of the university's six undergraduate schools. Each year the university presents an <a href="opera">opera</a> in the spring semester and Shakespearean plays in both the fall and spring semesters. A service called "Vespers", presented occasionally throughout the school year, combines music, speech, and drama. The Division of Fine Arts includes an RTV department with a campus radio and television station, <a href="WBJU">WBJU</a>. More than a hundred concerts, recitals, and laboratory theater productions are also presented annually.

Each fall, as a recruiting tool, the university sponsors a "High School Festival" in which students compete in music, art, and speech (including preaching) contests with their peers from around the country. In the spring, a similar competition sponsored by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Christian%20Schools">American Association of Christian Schools</a>, and hosted by BJU since 1977, brings thousands of national finalists to the university from around the country. In 2005, 120 of the finalists from previous years returned to BJU as freshmen.

Bob Jones University supports <a href="Young%20Earth%20Creationism">young-earth creationism</a>, all their biology faculty are young Earth creationists and the university rejects evolution, calling it "at best an unsupportable and unworkable hypothesis".

The school offers undergraduate majors in biology (zoo and wildlife, and cell biology), premed/predent, chemistry, engineering, and physics and also offers courses in astronomy. Between 80% and 100% of the pre-med graduates are accepted to medical school every year. The Department of Biology hosts two research programs on campus, one in cancer research, the other in animal behavior. In 2008 no member of the BJU science faculty held a degree in <a href="geology">geology</a>, and the university offered only one introductory course in the subject. Although ten of the sixteen members of the science faculty have undergraduate degrees from BJU, all earned their doctorates from accredited, non-religious institutions of higher learning. 
The university's nursing major is approved by the South Carolina State Board of Nursing, and a BJU graduate with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science%20in%20Nursing">BSN</a> is eligible to take the National Council Licensure Examination to become a <a href="registered%20nurse">registered nurse</a>. The BJU engineering program was accredited by the <a href="ABET">Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)</a>.

Bob Jones, Sr. was leery of <a href="academic%20accreditation">academic accreditation</a> almost from the founding of the college, and by the early 1930s, he had publicly stated his opposition to holding <a href="regional%20accreditation">regional accreditation</a>. Jones and the college were criticized for this stance, and academic recognition, as well as student and faculty recruitment, were hindered.

In 1944, Jones wrote to <a href="John%20Walvoord">John Walvoord</a> of <a href="Dallas%20Theological%20Seminary">Dallas Theological Seminary</a> that while the university had "no objection to educational work highly standardized…. We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college." Five years later, Jones reflected that "it cost us something to stay out of an association, but we stayed out. We have lived up to our convictions." In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the university more than doubled in size.

Because graduates did not have the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students. Early in the history of the college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJU credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being accepted by most of the major graduate and professional schools in the United States. Undoubtedly helpful was that some of the university's strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.

Nevertheless, by the early 2000s, the university quietly reexamined its position on accreditation as <a href="Diploma%20mill">degree mills</a> proliferated and various government bureaucracies, such as law enforcement agencies, began excluding BJU graduates on the grounds that the university did not appear on appropriate federal lists. In 2004, the university began the process of joining the <a href="Transnational%20Association%20of%20Christian%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools</a>. Candidate status—effectively, accreditation—was obtained in April 2005, and full membership in the Association was conferred in November 2006. In December 2011, BJU announced its intention to apply for regional accreditation with the <a href="Southern%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> (SACSCOC), and it received that accreditation in 2017.

In "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" national university ranking, Bob Jones was unranked in 2011, #606 in 2010, and #279 in 2009. In 2014, the Educate to Career College Ranking Index listed BJU as 15th in the nation by economic value. 

Both <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Sr.">Bob Jones, Sr.</a> and <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> believed that <a href="film">film</a> could be an excellent medium for mass evangelism, and in 1950, the university established "Unusual Films" within the School of Fine Arts. (The studio name derives from a former BJU promotional slogan, "The World's Most Unusual University".) <a href="Bob%20Jones%2C%20Jr.">Bob Jones, Jr.</a> selected a speech teacher, <a href="Katherine%20Stenholm">Katherine Stenholm</a>, as the first director. Although she had no experience in cinema, she took summer courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> and received personal instruction from Hollywood specialists, such as <a href="Rudolph%20Sternad">Rudolph Sternad</a>.

Unusual Films has produced seven feature-length films, each with an evangelistic emphasis: "Wine of Morning", "Red Runs the River", "Flame in the Wind", "Sheffey", "Beyond the Night", "The Printing", and "Milltown Pride". "Wine of Morning" (1955), based on a novel by Bob Jones, Jr., represented the United States at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The first four films are historical dramas set, respectively, in the time of Christ, the U.S. Civil War, 16th-century Spain, and the late 19th-century South—the latter a fictionalized treatment of the life of Methodist evangelist, <a href="Robert%20Sheffey">Robert Sayers Sheffey</a>. "Beyond the Night" closely follows an actual 20th-century missionary saga in Central Africa, and "The Printing" uses composite characters to portray the persecution of believers in the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. According to <a href="The%20Dove%20Foundation">The Dove Foundation</a>, "The Printing" "no doubt will urge Christian believers everywhere to appreciate the freedoms they enjoy. It is inspiring!" In 1999, Unusual Films began producing feature films for children, including "The Treasure Map", "Project Dinosaur", and "Appalachian Trial". They also released a short animated film for children, "The Golden Rom". Unusual Films returned to their customary format in 2011 with their release of "Milltown Pride", a historical film set in 1920s upstate South Carolina.

Unusual Films also maintains a student film production program. The Cinema Production program is designed to give professional training in all facets of motion picture production. This training combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in a variety of areas including directing, editing, and cinematography. Before graduation, seniors produce their own high-definition short film which they write, direct, and edit.

<a href="BJU%20Press">BJU Press</a> originated from the need for textbooks for the burgeoning <a href="Christian%20school">Christian school</a> movement, and today it is the largest book publisher in South Carolina. The press publishes a full range of K–12 textbooks. More than a million pre-college students around the world use BJU textbooks, and the press has about 2,500 titles in print.

BJU Press also offers distance learning courses online, via DVD, and via hard drive. Another ancillary, the Academy of Home Education, is a "service organization for homeschooling families" that maintains student records, administers achievement testing, and issues high school diplomas. The press sold its music division, <a href="SoundForth">SoundForth</a>, to <a href="Lorenz%20Publishing">Lorenz Publishing</a> on October 1, 2012.

The university operates Bob Jones Academy, which enrolls students from preschool through 12th grade. With about 1500 students, it is the largest K–12 private school in the Carolinas and one of the largest in the Southeast.

Religion is a major aspect of life and curriculum at BJU. The BJU Creed, written in 1927 by journalist and prohibitionist <a href="Samuel%20W.%20Small">Sam Small</a>, is recited by students and faculty four days a week at chapel services.

The university also encourages <a href="church%20planting">church planting</a> in areas of the United States "in great need of fundamental churches", and it has provided financial and logistical assistance to ministerial graduates in starting more than a hundred new churches. Bob Jones III has also encouraged non-ministerial students to put their career plans on hold for two or three years to provide lay leadership for small churches. Students of various majors participate in Missions Advance (formerly Mission Prayer Band), an organization that prays for missionaries and attempts to stimulate campus interest in world evangelism. During summers and Christmas breaks, about 150 students participate in teams that use their musical, language, trade, and aviation skills to promote Christian missions around the world. Although a separate nonprofit corporation, Gospel Fellowship Association, an organization founded by Bob Jones Sr. and associated with BJU, is one of the largest fundamentalist mission boards in the country. Through its "Timothy Fund", the university also sponsors international students who are training for the ministry.

The university requires use of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts. The university's position has been criticized by some other fundamentalists, including fellow conservative university <a href="Pensacola%20Christian%20College">Pensacola Christian College</a>, which in 1998 produced a widely distributed videotape which argued that this "leaven of fundamentalism" was passed from the 19th-century Princeton theologian <a href="Benjamin%20B.%20Warfield">Benjamin B. Warfield</a> (1851–1921) through Charles Brokenshire (1885–1954) to current BJU faculty members and graduates.

Strict rules govern student life at BJU. Some of these are based directly on the university's interpretation of the Bible. For instance, the 2015–16 Student Handbook states, "Students are to avoid any types of entertainment that could be considered immodest or that contain profanity, scatological realism, sexual perversion, erotic realism, lurid violence, occultism and false philosophical or religious assumptions." Grounds for immediate dismissal include stealing, immorality (including sexual relations between unmarried students), possession of hard-core pornography, use of alcohol or drugs, and participating in a public demonstration for a cause the university opposes. Similar "moral failures" are grounds for terminating the employment of faculty and staff. In 1998, a homosexual alumnus was threatened with arrest if he visited the campus.

For years, male students were required to wear slacks, dress shirts and ties on campus during the day. This requirement has since been loosened; men are allowed the option of wearing polo shirts or dress shirts on weekdays until 5 pm, and are no longer required to wear ties. Women are required to wear skirts and dresses on campus on weekdays until 5 pm. They are also required to attend chapel four days a week, as well as at least two services per week at an approved "local fundamental church."

Other rules are not based on a specific biblical passage. For instance, the Handbook notes that "there is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class', but a student who wishes to display orderliness and concern for others will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students." In 2008 a campus spokesman also said that one goal of the dress code was "to teach our young people to dress professionally" on campus while giving them "the ability to...choose within the biblically accepted options of dress" when they were off campus.

Additional rules include the requirement that freshman resident hall students sign out before leaving campus and that resident hall students abide by a campus curfew of 11:00 pm, with lights out at midnight. Students are forbidden to go to movie theaters while in residence, or listen to most contemporary popular music. Male students with upperclassman privileges and graduate students may have facial hair that is fully grown in prior to the start of the semester, neatly 
trimmed and well maintained at approximately ½ inch or less. Women are expected to dress modestly and wear dresses or skirts that come to the knee to class and religious services. The university prohibits students from wearing clothing that displays the logos of <a href="Abercrombie%20%26amp%3B%20Fitch">Abercrombie & Fitch</a> or its subsidiary <a href="Hollister%20Co.">Hollister</a> because these companies have "shown an unusual degree of antagonism to biblical morality".

 After BJU abandoned intercollegiate sports in 1933, its intramural sports program included competition in <a href="soccer">soccer</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="softball">softball</a>, <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="badminton">badminton</a>, <a href="flag%20football">flag football</a>, <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a>, <a href="racquetball">racquetball</a>, and <a href="water%20polo">water polo</a>. The university also competed in intercollegiate <a href="debate">debate</a> within the <a href="National%20Educational%20Debate%20Association">National Educational Debate Association</a>, in intercollegiate <a href="mock%20trial">mock trial</a> and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> competitions, and participated at South Carolina Student Legislature. In 2012, BJU joined Division I of <a href="National%20Christian%20College%20Athletic%20Association">National Christian College Athletic Association</a> (NCCAA) and in 2014 participated in intercollegiate soccer, basketball, cross-country, and golf. The teams are known as the Bruins.

The university requires all unmarried incoming freshman students under the age of 23 to join one of 45 "societies". Societies meet most Fridays for entertainment and fellowship and also hold a weekly prayer meeting. Societies compete with one another in intramural sports, debate, and Scholastic Bowl. The university also has a student-staffed newspaper ("The Collegian"), and yearbook ("Vintage").

Early in December, thousands of students, faculty, and visitors gather around the front campus fountain for an annual Christmas carol sing and lighting ceremony, culminating in the illumination of tens of thousands of Christmas lights. On December 3, 2004, the ceremony broke the <a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> for <a href="Christmas%20carol">Christmas carol</a>ing with 7,514 carolers.

Before 2015, students and faculty were required to attend a six-day Bible Conference in lieu of a traditional Spring Break. However, the university announced that beginning in 2016, Bible Conference will be held in February, and students will be given a week of Spring Break in March. The Conference typically attracts fundamentalist preachers and laymen from around the country, and some BJU class reunions are held during the week.

BJU's athletic teams compete in Division II of the <a href="National%20Christian%20College%20Athletic%20Association">National Christian College Athletic Association</a> (NCCAA) and are collectively known as the Bruins. The school began its inaugural intercollegiate season with four teams: men's soccer, men's basketball, women's soccer, and women's basketball. Intercollegiate golf and cross country teams were added in the 2013–2014 school year.

British Empire

The British Empire comprised the <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s, <a href="Crown%20colony">colonies</a>, <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a>s, <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">mandates</a> and other <a href="Dependent%20territory">territories</a> ruled or administered by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and its predecessor states. It originated with the <a href="English%20overseas%20possessions">overseas possessions</a> and <a href="trading%20post">trading post</a>s established by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20empires">largest empire in history</a> and, for over a century, was the foremost <a href="Power%20%28international%20relations%29%23Categories%20of%20power">global power</a>. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, <a href="Common%20law">legal</a>, <a href="English%20language">linguistic</a> and <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cultural</a> legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase "<a href="the%20empire%20on%20which%20the%20sun%20never%20sets">the empire on which the sun never sets</a>" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

During the <a href="Age%20of%20Discovery">Age of Discovery</a> in the 15th and 16th centuries, <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portugal</a> and <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">France</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Netherlands</a> began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England and then, following <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">union between England and Scotland</a> in 1707, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, the dominant <a href="Colonialism">colonial power</a> in North America. It then became the dominant power in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> after the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>'s conquest of <a href="Mughal%20Bengal">Mughal Bengal</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a> in 1757.

The independence of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> in North America in 1783 after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a> caused Britain to lose some of its oldest and most populous colonies. British attention soon turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. After the defeat of France in the <a href="French%20revolutionary%20wars">Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (1792–1815), Britain emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the 19th century. <a href="Royal%20Navy%231815%E2%80%931914">Unchallenged at sea</a>, British dominance was later described as "<a href="Pax%20Britannica">Pax Britannica</a>" ("British Peace"), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global <a href="hegemon">hegemon</a> and adopted the role of global policeman. In the early 19th century, the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> began to transform Britain; by the time of <a href="the%20Great%20Exhibition">the Great Exhibition</a> in 1851 the country was described as the "workshop of the world". The British Empire expanded to include <a href="British%20Raj">most of India</a>, large <a href="British%20Empire%23Cape%20to%20Cairo">parts of Africa</a> and many other territories throughout the world. Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its own colonies, its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively <a href="Informal%20Empire">controlled the economies of many regions</a>, such as <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>.

In Britain, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During the <a href="19th%20Century">19th Century</a>, Britain's population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, which caused significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> under <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.

By the start of the 20th century, <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead. Subsequent military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, during which Britain relied heavily upon its empire. The conflict placed enormous strain on the military, financial and manpower resources of Britain. Although the British Empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power. In the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, Britain's colonies in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> were occupied by <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a>. Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire. India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">independence</a> as part of a larger <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a> movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire. The <a href="Transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20over%20Hong%20Kong">transfer</a> of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire. Fourteen <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">overseas territories</a> remain under British sovereignty.

After independence, many former British colonies joined the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, a free association of independent states. The United Kingdom is now one of 16 Commonwealth nations, a grouping known informally as the <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s, that share a <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">monarch</a>, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>.

The foundations of the British Empire were laid when <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII of England</a>, following the successes of <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portugal</a> in overseas exploration, commissioned <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a> to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic</a>. Cabot sailed in 1497, five years after the <a href="European%20discovery%20of%20America">European discovery of America</a>, but he made landfall on the coast of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, and, mistakenly believing (like <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>) that he had reached Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again.

No further attempts to establish English colonies in the Americas were made until well into the reign of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, during the last decades of the 16th century. In the meantime the
1533 <a href="Statute%20in%20Restraint%20of%20Appeals">Statute in Restraint of Appeals</a> had declared "that this realm of England is an Empire". The subsequent <a href="English%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> turned England and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Spain into implacable enemies. In 1562, the <a href="List%20of%20English%20monarchs">English Crown</a> encouraged the <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s <a href="John%20Hawkins%20%28naval%20commander%29">John Hawkins</a> and <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a>. This effort was rebuffed and later, as the <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281585%29">Anglo-Spanish Wars</a> intensified, Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>. At the same time, influential writers such as <a href="Richard%20Hakluyt">Richard Hakluyt</a> and <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a> (who was the first to use the term "British Empire") were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire. By this time, Spain had become the dominant power in the Americas and was exploring the Pacific Ocean, Portugal had established trading posts and forts from the coasts of Africa and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> to China, and <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">France</a> had begun to settle the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a> area, later to become <a href="New%20France">New France</a>.

Although England trailed behind other European powers in establishing overseas colonies, it had been engaged during the 16th century in the settlement of Ireland with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents dating back to the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland">Norman invasion of Ireland</a> in 1169. Several people who helped establish the <a href="Plantations%20of%20Ireland">Plantations of Ireland</a> also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the <a href="West%20Country%20men">West Country men</a>.

In 1578, Elizabeth I granted a patent to <a href="Humphrey%20Gilbert">Humphrey Gilbert</a> for discovery and overseas exploration. That year, Gilbert sailed for the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> with the intention of engaging in <a href="piracy">piracy</a> and establishing a colony in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic. In 1583 he embarked on a second attempt, on this occasion to the island of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> whose harbour he formally claimed for England, although no settlers were left behind. Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584. Later that year, Raleigh founded the <a href="Roanoke%20Colony">Roanoke Colony</a> on the coast of present-day <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, but lack of supplies caused the colony to fail.

In 1603, <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James VI, King of Scots</a>, ascended (as James I) to the English throne and in 1604 negotiated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281604%29">Treaty of London</a>, ending hostilities with <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a>. Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies. The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">English settlement</a> of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of <a href="Joint-stock%20company">joint-stock companies</a>, most notably the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>, to administer colonies and overseas trade. This period, until the loss of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American War of Independence</a> towards the end of the 18th century, has subsequently been referred to by some historians as the "First British Empire".

The <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> initially provided England's most important and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An attempt to establish a colony in <a href="British%20Guiana">Guiana</a> in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in <a href="Saint%20Lucia">St Lucia</a> (1605) and <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a> (1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in <a href="Saint%20Kitts">St. Kitts</a> (1624), <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> (1627) and <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> (1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of <a href="Plantation">sugar plantations</a> successfully used by the Portuguese in <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament <a href="Navigation%20Acts">decreed</a> in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Dutch Provinces</a>—a series of <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Wars">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a>—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamas</a>.
England's first permanent settlement in the Americas was founded in 1607 in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a>, led by Captain <a href="John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29">John Smith</a> and managed by the <a href="London%20Company">Virginia Company</a>. <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> was settled and claimed by England as a result of the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's <a href="Sea%20Venture">flagship</a>, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed <a href="Somers%20Isles%20Company">Somers Isles Company</a>. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the <a href="Crown%20colony">crown</a>, thereby founding the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Colony of Virginia</a>. The <a href="London%20and%20Bristol%20Company">London and Bristol Company</a> was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth</a> was founded as a haven for <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> religious separatists, later known as the <a href="Pilgrim">Pilgrim</a>s. Fleeing from <a href="religious%20persecution">religious persecution</a> would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous <a href="Transatlantic%20crossing">trans-Atlantic voyage</a>: <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">Maryland</a> was founded as a haven for <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholics</a> (1634), <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a> (1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut (1639) for <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalists</a>. The <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Province of Carolina</a> was founded in 1663. With the surrender of <a href="Fort%20Amsterdam">Fort Amsterdam</a> in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a>, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Wars">Second Anglo-Dutch War</a>, in exchange for <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>. In 1681, the colony of <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> was founded by <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a>. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.

In 1670, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> incorporated by <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a> in the area known as <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>, which would later form a large proportion of the <a href="Canada">Dominion of Canada</a>. Forts and trading posts established by the HBC were frequently the subject of attacks by the French, who had established their own fur trading colony in adjacent <a href="New%20France">New France</a>.

Two years later, the <a href="Royal%20African%20Company">Royal African Company</a> was inaugurated, receiving from King Charles a monopoly of the trade to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, <a href="slavery">slavery</a> was the basis of the British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">slaves transported across the Atlantic</a>. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as <a href="James%20Island%20%28The%20Gambia%29">James Island</a>, <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Ghana">Accra</a> and <a href="Bunce%20Island">Bunce Island</a>. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British cities</a> as <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, which formed the third corner of the <a href="triangular%20trade">triangular trade</a> with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> during the <a href="Middle%20Passage">Middle Passage</a> was one in seven.

In 1695, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Parliament of Scotland</a> granted a charter to the <a href="Company%20of%20Scotland">Company of Scotland</a>, which established a settlement in 1698 on the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Granada">New Granada</a>, and afflicted by <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, the colony was abandoned two years later. The <a href="Darien%20scheme">Darien scheme</a> was a financial disaster for Scotland — a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise — and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire. The episode also had major political consequences, persuading the governments of both England and Scotland of the merits of a union of countries, rather than just crowns. This occurred in 1707 with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union">Treaty of Union</a>, establishing the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>.

At the end of the 16th century, England and the Netherlands began to challenge Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private <a href="Joint%20stock%20company">joint-stock companies</a> to finance the voyages—the English, later British, <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative <a href="spice%20trade">spice trade</a>, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">East Indies archipelago</a>, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three <a href="Anglo-Dutch%20Wars">Anglo-Dutch Wars</a> of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688 when the Dutch <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a> ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">Nine Years' War</a> as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their <a href="military%20budget">military budget</a> on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.

The death of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20Spain">Charles II of Spain</a> in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philippe of Anjou</a>, a grandson of the <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">King of France</a>, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> against Spain and France in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, which lasted until 1714.

At the concluding <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> and <a href="Acadia">Acadia</a>, and from Spain, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a>. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>. Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative "<a href="asiento">asiento</a>" (permission to sell slaves in <a href="Ibero-America">Spanish America</a>) to Britain.
During the middle decades of the 18th century, there were several outbreaks of military conflict on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, the <a href="Carnatic%20Wars">Carnatic Wars</a>, as the English East India Company (often known simply as "the Company") and its French counterpart, the <a href="French%20East%20India%20Company">French East India Company</a> ("Compagnie française des Indes orientales"), struggled alongside local rulers to fill the vacuum that had been left by the decline of the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Plassey">Battle of Plassey</a> in 1757, in which the British, led by <a href="Robert%20Clive">Robert Clive</a>, defeated the <a href="Nawab%20of%20Bengal">Nawab of Bengal</a> and his French allies, left the British East India Company in control of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> and as the major military and political power in India. France was left control of its <a href="French%20India">enclaves</a> but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s, ending French hopes of controlling India. In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a>, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian <a href="sepoy">sepoy</a>s.

The British and French struggles in India became but one theatre of the global <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1756–1763) involving France, Britain and the other major European powers. The signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris (1763)</a> had important consequences for the future of the British Empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>, and the ceding of <a href="New%20France">New France</a> to Britain (leaving a sizeable <a href="French%20Canadian">French-speaking population</a> under British control) and <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a> to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power.

During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan "<a href="No%20taxation%20without%20representation">No taxation without representation</a>", a perceived violation of the guaranteed <a href="Rights%20of%20Englishmen">Rights of Englishmen</a>. The <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">war</a> in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States declared independence</a>. The entry of <a href="France%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">France</a> into the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Yorktown</a> in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms. American independence was acknowledged at the <a href="Peace%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Peace of Paris</a> in 1783.
The loss of such a large portion of <a href="British%20America">British America</a>, at the time Britain's most populous overseas possession, is seen by some historians as the event defining the transition between the "first" and "second" empires, in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">Wealth of Nations</a>", published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> should replace the old <a href="Mercantilism">mercantilist</a> policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and Britain after 1783 seemed to confirm Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.

The war to the south influenced British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists who went to the <a href="Saint%20John%20River%20%28New%20Brunswick%29">Saint John</a> and <a href="Saint%20Croix%20River%20%28Maine%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Brunswick%29">Saint Croix river</a> valleys, then part of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, felt too far removed from the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> as a separate colony in 1784. The <a href="Constitutional%20Act%20of%201791">Constitutional Act of 1791</a> created the provinces of <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> (mainly English-speaking) and <a href="Lower%20Canada">Lower Canada</a> (mainly <a href="French%20language">French-speaking</a>) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.

Tensions between Britain and the United States escalated again during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to <a href="Impressment">impress</a> men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a>, ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States.

Since 1718, <a href="penal%20transportation">transportation</a> to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic. Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia. The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer <a href="Willem%20Janszoon">Willem Janszoon</a> in 1606 and was later named <a href="New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29">New Holland</a> by the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific <a href="First%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">voyage</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. In 1778, <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>, Cook's <a href="Botany">botanist</a> on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> for the establishment of a <a href="Penal%20colony">penal settlement</a>, and in 1787 the first shipment of <a href="Convicts%20in%20Australia">convicts</a> set sail, arriving in 1788. Britain continued to transport convicts to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> until 1840. The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold, mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> for a time the richest city in the world and the second largest city (after <a href="London">London</a>) in the British Empire.

During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first discovered by Dutch explorer <a href="Abel%20Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> in 1642, and claimed the <a href="North%20Island">North</a> and <a href="South%20Island">South</a> islands for the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British crown</a> in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, interaction between the indigenous <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods. European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Company">New Zealand Company</a> announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain <a href="William%20Hobson">William Hobson</a> and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Waitangi">Treaty of Waitangi</a>. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.

Britain was challenged again by France under <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a>.

The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones in which Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Trafalgar</a> in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, including those of the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815. Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the <a href="United%20States%20of%20the%20Ionian%20Islands">Ionian Islands</a>, <a href="Malta%20Protectorate">Malta</a> (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), <a href="British%20Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>, and <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a>; Spain ceded <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>; the Netherlands <a href="British%20Guiana">Guyana</a>, and the <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a>. Britain returned <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, Martinique, <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>, and <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> to France, and <a href="Java">Java</a> and <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> to the Netherlands, while gaining control of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> (1795–1815).

With the advent of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, goods produced by slavery became less important to the <a href="British%20economy">British economy</a>. Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular <a href="slave%20rebellion">slave rebellion</a>s. With support from the British <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolitionist</a> movement, <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> enacted the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Slave Trade Act</a> in 1807, which abolished the <a href="History%20of%20slavery">slave trade</a> in the empire. In 1808, <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Colony%20and%20Protectorate">Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate</a> was designated an official British colony for freed slaves. Parliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the <a href="West%20India%20Committee">West India Committee</a> decline. The <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">Slavery Abolition Act</a>, passed the following year, abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, finally bringing the Empire into line with the law in the UK (with the exception of <a href="St.%20Helena">St. Helena</a>, Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full <a href="emancipation">emancipation</a> after a period of four to six years of "apprenticeship". The British government compensated slave-owners.

Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's "imperial century" by some historians, around of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire. Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than <a href="The%20Great%20Game">Russia in Central Asia</a>. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the "<a href="Pax%20Britannica">Pax Britannica</a>", and a foreign policy of "<a href="splendid%20isolation">splendid isolation</a>". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Thailand">Siam</a>, which has been described by some historians as an "<a href="Informal%20Empire">Informal Empire</a>".

British imperial strength was underpinned by the <a href="Steamboat">steamship</a> and the <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a>, new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, called the <a href="All%20Red%20Line">All Red Line</a>.

The <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> (1799), the capture of <a href="Java">Java</a> from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of <a href="Penang%20Island">Penang Island</a> (1786), <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> (1819) and <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a> (1824), and the defeat of <a href="British%20rule%20in%20Burma">Burma</a> (1826).

From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable <a href="opium">opium</a> export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a> in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a> of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First Opium War</a>, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Island">Hong Kong Island</a>, at that time a minor settlement.

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the <a href="Regulating%20Act%20of%201773">Regulating Act of 1773</a>, <a href="Pitt%27s%20India%20Act">Pitt's India Act</a> of 1784 and the <a href="Charter%20Act%20of%201813">Charter Act of 1813</a> which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion</a>, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of <a href="sepoy">sepoy</a>s, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201858">Government of India Act 1858</a>, establishing the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, where an appointed <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">governor-general</a> administered India and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> was crowned the Empress of India. India became the empire's most valuable possession, "the Jewel in the Crown", and was the most important source of Britain's strength.

A series of serious crop failures in the late 19th century led to <a href="Famine%20in%20India">widespread famines</a> on the subcontinent in which it is estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.

During the 19th century, Britain and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> vied to fill the power vacuums that had been left by the declining <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajar dynasty</a> and <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>. This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the "<a href="The%20Great%20Game">Great Game</a>". As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281826%E2%80%931828%29">Persia</a> and <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281828%E2%80%931829%29">Turkey</a> demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India. In 1839, Britain moved to pre-empt this by invading <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, but the <a href="First%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">First Anglo-Afghan War</a> was a disaster for Britain.

When Russia invaded the Turkish <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a> to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War (1854–56)</a>, which involved new techniques of <a href="modern%20warfare">modern warfare</a>, was the only <a href="World%20war">global war</a> fought between Britain and another <a href="Imperialism">imperial power</a> during the "Pax Britannica" and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing <a href="Baluchistan%20%28Chief%20Commissioner%27s%20Province%29">Baluchistan</a> in 1876 and Russia annexing <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kirghizia</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, and <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective <a href="Sphere%20of%20influence">spheres of influence</a> in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the <a href="Anglo-Russian%20Entente">Anglo-Russian Entente</a>. The destruction of the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> by the Japanese at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.

The Dutch East India Company had founded the <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the <a href="Indies">East Indies</a>. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> (or <a href="Boer">Boer</a>) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the <a href="Flanders%20Campaign">Flanders Campaign</a>. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the <a href="Voortrekkers">Voortrekkers</a> clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the <a href="Sotho%20people">Sotho</a> and the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a> nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a> or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a> (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two <a href="Boer%20Republics">Boer Republics</a> following the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902).

In 1869 the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> opened under <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Napoleon III</a>, linking the Mediterranean with the Indian Ocean. Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the "jugular vein of the Empire". In 1875, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government of <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> bought the indebted Egyptian ruler <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Isma'il Pasha's</a> 44% shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (equivalent to £ in ). Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage. Joint Anglo-French financial control over Egypt ended in outright British occupation in 1882. The French were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the British position, but a compromise was reached with the 1888 <a href="Convention%20of%20Constantinople">Convention of Constantinople</a>, which made the Canal officially neutral territory.

With competitive French, <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">Belgian</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese</a> activity in the lower <a href="Congo%20River">Congo River</a> region undermining orderly colonisation of tropical Africa, the <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference</a> of 1884–85 was held to regulate the competition between the European powers in what was called the "<a href="Scramble%20for%20Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>" by defining "effective occupation" as the criterion for international recognition of territorial claims. The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>. A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the <a href="Mahdist%20War">Mahdist Army</a> in 1896, and rebuffed an attempted French invasion <a href="Fashoda%20Incident">at Fashoda</a> in 1898. Sudan was nominally made an <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20Sudan">Anglo-Egyptian condominium</a>, but a British colony in reality.

British gains in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern</a> and <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> prompted <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>, pioneer of British expansion in Southern Africa, to urge a "<a href="Cape%20to%20Cairo%20Railway">Cape to Cairo</a>" railway linking the strategically important <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> to the mineral-rich south of the continent. During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a>, <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">occupied and annexed</a> territories subsequently named after him, <a href="Rhodesia%20%28name%29">Rhodesia</a>.

The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 <a href="Report%20on%20the%20Affairs%20of%20British%20North%20America">Durham Report</a>, which proposed unification and self-government for <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Canada">Lower Canada</a>, as a solution to political unrest which had erupted in <a href="Rebellions%20of%201837">armed rebellions</a> in 1837. This began with the passing of the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201840">Act of Union</a> in 1840, which created the <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">Province of Canada</a>. <a href="Responsible%20government">Responsible government</a> was first granted to <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the <a href="British%20North%20America%20Act%2C%201867">British North America Act, 1867</a> by the <a href="British%20Parliament">British Parliament</a>, Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the <a href="Dominion%20of%20Canada">Dominion of Canada</a>, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a>. Australia and New Zealand achieved similar levels of self-government after 1900, with the Australian colonies <a href="federation%20of%20Australia">federating in 1901</a>. The term "dominion status" was officially introduced at the <a href="Imperial%20Conference">Colonial Conference of 1907</a>.

The last decades of the 19th century saw concerted <a href="political%20campaign">political campaign</a>s for Irish <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a>. Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201800">Act of Union 1800</a> after the <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>, and had suffered a severe <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">famine</a> between 1845 and 1852. Home rule was supported by the British <a href="Prime%20minister">Prime minister</a>, <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Bill%201886">Home Rule bill</a> was defeated in Parliament. Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire. A <a href="Irish%20Government%20Bill%201893">second Home Rule bill</a> was also defeated for similar reasons. A <a href="Home%20Rule%20Act%201914">third bill</a> was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> leading to the 1916 <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a>.

By the turn of the 20th century, fears had begun to grow in Britain that it would no longer be able to defend the <a href="metropole">metropole</a> and the entirety of the empire while at the same time maintaining the policy of "<a href="splendid%20isolation">splendid isolation</a>". Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war. Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific and threatened at home by the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>, Britain <a href="Anglo-Japanese%20Alliance">formed an alliance</a> with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies <a href="Entente%20cordiale">France</a> and <a href="Anglo-Russian%20Entente">Russia</a> in 1904 and 1907, respectively.

Britain's fears of war with Germany were realised in 1914 with the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a> and <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 <a href="Sykes%E2%80%93Picot%20Agreement">Sykes–Picot Agreement</a>. This agreement was not divulged to the <a href="Hussein%20bin%20Ali%2C%20Sharif%20of%20Mecca">Sharif of Mecca</a>, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.
The British declaration of war on Germany and its allies also committed the colonies and Dominions, which provided invaluable military, financial and material support. Over 2.5 million men served in the armies of the <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s, as well as many thousands of volunteers from the <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colonies</a>. The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right. The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a>. Canadians viewed the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> in a similar light. The important contribution of the Dominions to the <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a> was recognised in 1917 by the British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> when he invited each of the Dominion Prime Ministers to join an <a href="Imperial%20War%20Cabinet">Imperial War Cabinet</a> to co-ordinate imperial policy.

Under the terms of the concluding <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> signed in 1919, the empire reached its greatest extent with the addition of and 13 million new subjects. The colonies of Germany and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> were distributed to the Allied powers as <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>s. Britain gained control of <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>, <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Transjordan</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Iraq%20%28Mandate%20administration%29">Iraq</a>, parts of <a href="British%20Cameroons">Cameroon</a> and <a href="British%20Togoland">Togoland</a>, and <a href="Tanganyika%20%28territory%29">Tanganyika</a>. The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> gained South West Africa (modern-day <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>), Australia gained <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and New Zealand <a href="Western%20Samoa%20Trust%20Territory">Western Samoa</a>. <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a> was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.

The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Japan and Germany helped in part by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations. The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British economy.

In 1919, the frustrations caused by delays to <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Irish home rule</a> led the MPs of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, a pro-independence party that had won a majority of the Irish seats in the <a href="Irish%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 British general election</a>, to establish an <a href="D%C3%A1il%20%C3%89ireann%20%28Irish%20Republic%29">independent parliament</a> in Dublin, at which <a href="Irish%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Irish independence was declared</a>. The <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> simultaneously began a <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla war</a> against the British administration. The <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Anglo-Irish War</a> ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a>, creating the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, consisting of six of the 32 <a href="Counties%20of%20Ireland">Irish counties</a> which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201920">Government of Ireland Act</a>, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.
A similar struggle began in India when the <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201919">Government of India Act 1919</a> failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the <a href="Ghadar%20Conspiracy">Ghadar Conspiracy</a> ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the <a href="Rowlatt%20Act">Rowlatt Act</a>s. This led to tension, particularly in the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a>, where repressive measures culminated in the <a href="Jallianwala%20Bagh%20massacre">Amritsar Massacre</a>. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent <a href="Non-cooperation%20movement">Non-Co-Operation movement</a> was called off in March 1922 following the <a href="Chauri%20Chaura%20incident">Chauri Chaura incident</a>, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.

In 1922, Egypt, which had been declared a British <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> at the outbreak of the First World War, was <a href="Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Egyptian%20Independence">granted formal independence</a>, though it continued to be a British <a href="client%20state">client state</a> until 1954. <a href="British%20Army">British troops</a> remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20treaty%20of%201936">Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</a> in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> zone. In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Iraq%20%28Mandate%20administration%29">Iraq</a>, a British <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">mandate</a> since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The <a href="1917%20Balfour%20Declaration">1917 Balfour Declaration</a>, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly <a href="1936%E2%80%9339%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">revolted in 1936</a>. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a <a href="Jewish%20insurgency%20in%20Palestine">Jewish insurgency</a>.

The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the <a href="1923%20Imperial%20Conference">1923 Imperial Conference</a>. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the <a href="Chanak%20Crisis">Chanak Crisis</a> the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lausanne">Treaty of Lausanne</a>. After pressure from the Irish Free State and South Africa, the <a href="1926%20Imperial%20Conference">1926 Imperial Conference</a> issued the <a href="Balfour%20Declaration%20of%201926">Balfour Declaration of 1926</a>, declaring the Dominions to be "autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another" within a "British <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster</a>. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and <a href="Dominion%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify <a href="Law%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British laws</a> and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. The Irish Free State distanced itself further from the British state with the introduction of a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Ireland">new constitution</a> in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.

Britain's declaration of war against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in September 1939 included the <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colonies</a> and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany, but Ireland chose to remain <a href="Irish%20neutrality">legally neutral</a> throughout <a href="The%20Emergency%20%28Ireland%29">the war</a>.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Fall of France</a> in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the German invasion of Greece on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> successfully lobbied President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> for <a href="military%20aid">military aid</a> from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the <a href="Atlantic%20Charter">Atlantic Charter</a>, which included the statement that "the rights of all peoples to choose the <a href="form%20of%20government">form of government</a> under which they live" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.

In December 1941, <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> launched, in quick succession, attacks on <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>, the United States naval base at <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">Fall of Singapore</a>, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 <a href="ANZUS">ANZUS Pact</a> between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.

Though Britain and the empire emerged victorious from the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the effects of the conflict were profound, both at home and abroad. Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power. Britain was left essentially bankrupt, with insolvency only averted in 1946 after the negotiation of <a href="Anglo-American%20loan">a $US 4.33 billion loan</a> from the United States, the last instalment of which was repaid in 2006. At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations. The situation was complicated further by the increasing <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism. In practice, however, American <a href="anti-communism">anti-communism</a> prevailed over <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check. The "<a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">wind of change</a>" ultimately meant that the British Empire's days were numbered, and on the whole, Britain adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies once stable, non-Communist governments were available to transfer power to. This was in contrast to other European powers such as France and Portugal, which waged costly and ultimately unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact. Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to five million, three million of whom were in Hong Kong.

The pro-decolonisation <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> government, elected at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a> and led by <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence</a>. India's two major political parties—the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> (led by <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>) and the <a href="All-India%20Muslim%20League">Muslim League</a> (led by <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate <a href="Islamic%20state">Islamic state</a> for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing <a href="Civil%20disorder">civil unrest</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Indian%20Navy%20mutiny">mutiny of</a> the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Indian%20Navy">Royal Indian Navy</a> during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a>, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly <a href="Partition%20of%20India">partition India</a> into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>, while Burma chose not to join.

The British <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">mandate in Palestine</a>, where an Arab majority lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British with a similar problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of <a href="Jewish%20refugees">Jewish refugees</a> seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> subsequently voted for a <a href="United%20Nations%20Partition%20Plan%20for%20Palestine">plan to partition Palestine</a> into a Jewish and an Arab state.

Following the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, anti-Japanese <a href="resistance%20movement">resistance movement</a>s in Malaya turned their attention towards the British, who had moved to quickly retake control of the colony, valuing it as a source of rubber and tin. The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted. The <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Federation of Malaya</a> within the Commonwealth. In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20North%20Borneo">North Borneo</a> joined to form <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations. <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union and maintained its status until independence in 1984.

In 1951, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdul Nasser</a>'s new revolutionary <a href="Politics%20of%20Egypt">government of Egypt</a> that had <a href="Egyptian%20Revolution%20of%201952">taken power in 1952</a>, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20Sudan">Sudan</a> would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow. <a href="History%20of%20Sudan%20%281956%E2%80%9369%29">Sudan</a> was granted independence on 1 January 1956.

In July 1956, Nasser unilaterally nationalised the Suez Canal. The response of <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on <a href="Republic%20of%20Egypt%20%281953%E2%80%9358%29">Egypt</a> that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied <a href="leverage%20%28finance%29">financial leverage</a> by threatening to sell US reserves of the <a href="Pound%20sterling">British pound</a> and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.

The <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> very publicly exposed Britain's limitations to the world and confirmed Britain's decline on the world stage, demonstrating that henceforth it could no longer act without at least the acquiescence, if not the full support, of the United States. The events at Suez wounded British <a href="Patriotism">national pride</a>, leading one <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> to describe it as "Britain's <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a>" and another to suggest that the country had become an "American <a href="Satellite%20state">satellite</a>". <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> later described the mindset she believed had befallen Britain's political leaders as "Suez syndrome" where they “went from believing that Britain could do anything to an almost neurotic belief that Britain could do nothing”, from which Britain did not recover until the successful recapture of the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> from <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> in 1982.

While the Suez Crisis caused British power in the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse. Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in <a href="Muscat%20and%20Oman">Oman</a> (<a href="Jebel%20Akhdar%20War">1957</a>), <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> (<a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20127">1958</a>) and <a href="Sheikhdom%20of%20Kuwait">Kuwait</a> (<a href="Operation%20Vantage">1961</a>), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States. Britain maintained a military presence in the Middle East for another decade. On 16 January 1968, a few weeks after the <a href="Pound%20sterling%23Bretton%20Woods">devaluation of the pound</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and his <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Defence Secretary</a> <a href="Denis%20Healey">Denis Healey</a> announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases <a href="East%20of%20Suez">East of Suez</a>, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and Singapore by the end of 1971, instead of 1975 as earlier planned. By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East, including 30,000 in Singapore. The British withdrew from <a href="South%20Yemen">Aden</a> in 1967, <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> in 1971, and the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a> in 1976.

Macmillan gave a <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">speech</a> in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa in February 1960 where he spoke of "the wind of change blowing through this continent". Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of <a href="Algerian%20War">colonial war</a> that France was fighting in <a href="French%20Algeria">Algeria</a>, and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly. To the three colonies that had been granted independence in the 1950s—<a href="History%20of%20Sudan%20%281956%E2%80%9369%29">Sudan</a>, the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a> and <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a>—were added nearly ten times that number during the 1960s.

Britain's remaining colonies in Africa, except for <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing</a> <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, were all granted independence by 1968. British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process. Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau Uprising</a>. In <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>, the 1965 <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> by the white minority resulted in a <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">civil war</a> that lasted until the <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> of 1979, which set the terms for recognised independence in 1980, as the new nation of <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>.

In the Mediterranean, a guerrilla war waged by <a href="EOKA">Greek Cypriots</a> ended in 1960 leading to an independent <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, with the UK retaining the <a href="military%20base">military base</a>s of <a href="Akrotiri%20and%20Dhekelia">Akrotiri and Dhekelia</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20islands%20in%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean islands</a> of <a href="Malta%20%28island%29">Malta</a> and <a href="Gozo">Gozo</a> were amicably granted independence from the UK in 1964 and became the country of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, though the idea had been raised in 1955 of <a href="Maltese%20United%20Kingdom%20integration%20referendum%2C%201956">integration with Britain</a>.

Most of the UK's <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a> from the <a href="West%20Indies%20Federation">West Indies Federation</a>, established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members. <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s, but <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a> and the <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a> opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence. The <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>, <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a> and <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> opted to retain ties with Britain, while <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a> achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, <a href="British%20Honduras">British Honduras</a>, became a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> in 1964 and was renamed <a href="Belize">Belize</a> in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A <a href="Belizean-Guatemalan%20territorial%20dispute">dispute with Guatemala</a> over claims to Belize was left unresolved.

British territories in the Pacific acquired independence in the 1970s beginning with <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> in 1970 and ending with <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> in 1980. Vanuatu's independence was delayed because of political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a <a href="Condominium%20%28international%20law%29">condominium</a> with France. Fiji, <a href="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>, the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> chose to become <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s.

In 1980, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, Britain's last African colony, became the independent nation of Zimbabwe. The <a href="New%20Hebrides">New Hebrides</a> achieved independence (as Vanuatu) in 1980, with Belize following suit in 1981. The passage of the <a href="British%20Nationality%20Act%201981">British Nationality Act 1981</a>, which reclassified the remaining Crown colonies as "British Dependent Territories" (renamed <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British Overseas Territories</a> in 2002) meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts, the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> <a href="Falklands%20War">invaded</a> the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>. Britain's ultimately successful military response to retake the islands during the ensuing <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a> was viewed by many to have contributed to reversing the downward trend in Britain's status as a world power. The same year, the Canadian government severed its last legal link with Britain by <a href="Patriation">patriating</a> the Canadian constitution from Britain. The <a href="Canada%20Act%201982">1982 Canada Act</a> passed by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British parliament</a> ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution. Similarly, the <a href="Constitution%20Act%201986">Constitution Act 1986</a> reformed the constitution of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> to sever its constitutional link with Britain, and the <a href="Australia%20Act%201986">Australia Act 1986</a> severed the constitutional link between Britain and the Australian states. In 1984, <a href="Brunei">Brunei</a>, Britain's last remaining Asian protectorate, gained its independence.

In September 1982 the Prime Minister, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government, on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong. Under the terms of the 1842 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nanking">Treaty of Nanking</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Island">Hong Kong Island</a> itself had been ceded to Britain "in perpetuity", but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the <a href="New%20Territories">New Territories</a>, which had been acquired under a <a href="Convention%20for%20the%20Extension%20of%20Hong%20Kong%20Territory">99-year lease in 1898</a>, due to expire in 1997. Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the <a href="Sino-British%20Joint%20Declaration">Sino-British Joint Declaration</a>, Hong Kong would become a <a href="special%20administrative%20region%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">special administrative region of the People's Republic of China</a>, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years. The <a href="Hong%20Kong%20handover%20ceremony">handover ceremony</a> in 1997 marked for many, including <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, who was in attendance, "the end of Empire".

The British imperial territory with the largest economy in 1870 was <a href="British%20India">British India</a> (including what are now <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>), followed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The territory with the largest economy in 1913 was the United Kingdom, followed by British India. The table does not include GDP estimates for <a href="British%20Africa">British Africa</a>n territories other than <a href="British%20Egypt">British Egypt</a>.

The following table gives the population of the British Empire and its territories, in several different time periods. The most populous territory in the empire was <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, which included what are now <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.

The empire's population was classified into <a href="white%20people">white people</a>, also referred to as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to as <a href="Person%20of%20color">persons of colour</a>, <a href="negro">negro</a>s and <a href="natives">natives</a>. The largest ethnic grouping in the empire was <a href="Indian%20people">Indians</a> (including what are now <a href="Pakistanis">Pakistanis</a> and <a href="Bangladeshis">Bangladeshis</a>), who were classified into a number of individual <a href="South%20Asian%20ethnic%20groups">South Asian ethnic groups</a>.

Britain retains sovereignty over 14 territories outside the British Isles, which were renamed the <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British Overseas Territories</a> in 2002. Four are uninhabited except for transient military or scientific personnel ; the remaining ten are self-governing to varying degrees and are reliant on the UK for <a href="Diplomacy">foreign relations</a> and defence. The British government has stated its willingness to assist any Overseas Territory that wishes to proceed to independence, where that is an option, and three territories have specifically voted to remain under British sovereignty (<a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in <a href="Bermudan%20independence%20referendum%2C%201995">1995</a>, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> in <a href="Gibraltar%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%202002">2002</a> and the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> in <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20sovereignty%20referendum%2C%202013">2013</a>).

British sovereignty of several of the overseas territories is disputed by their geographical neighbours: <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> is claimed by Spain, the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> and <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a> are claimed by <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and the <a href="British%20Indian%20Ocean%20Territory">British Indian Ocean Territory</a> is claimed by <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>. The <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Territory">British Antarctic Territory</a> is subject to overlapping claims by Argentina and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, while many countries do not recognise any territorial claims in Antarctica.

Most former British colonies and protectorates are among the 52 member states of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, a non-political, <a href="voluntary%20association">voluntary association</a> of equal members, comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people. Sixteen <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s voluntarily continue to share the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, as their head of state. These sixteen nations are distinct and equal legal entities – the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20Bahamas">The Bahamas</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Barbados">Barbados</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belize">Belize</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Grenada">Grenada</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Saint%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">Saint Kitts and Nevis</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>.
Decades, and in some cases centuries, of British rule and emigration have left their mark on the independent nations that arose from the British Empire. The empire established the use of English in regions around the world. Today it is the primary language of up to 400 million people and is spoken by about one and a half billion as a first, second or foreign language.

The spread of English from the latter half of the 20th century has been helped in part by the cultural and economic influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies. Except in Africa where nearly all the former colonies have adopted the <a href="presidential%20system">presidential system</a>, the English <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary system</a> has served as the template for the governments for many former colonies, and <a href="English%20law">English common law</a> for legal systems.
The British <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> still serves as the highest court of appeal for several former colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific. British <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> who travelled around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> to all continents. British colonial architecture, such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, can be seen in many cities that were once part of the British Empire.

Individual and team sports developed in Britain — particularly <a href="golf">golf</a>, <a href="association%20football">football</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a>, <a href="netball">netball</a>, <a href="lawn%20bowls">lawn bowls</a>, <a href="hockey">hockey</a> and <a href="lawn%20tennis">lawn tennis</a> — were also exported. The British choice of system of measurement, the <a href="Imperial%20units">imperial system</a>, continues to be used in some countries in various ways. The convention of <a href="Right-%20and%20left-hand%20traffic">driving on the left hand side of the road</a> has been retained in much of the former empire.

Political boundaries drawn by the British did not always reflect homogeneous ethnicities or religions, contributing to conflicts in formerly colonised areas. The British Empire was also responsible for large migrations of peoples. Millions left the British Isles, with the founding settler populations of the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand coming mainly from Britain and Ireland. Tensions remain between the white settler populations of these countries and their indigenous minorities, and between white settler minorities and indigenous majorities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Settlers in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided <a href="Irish%20nationalism">nationalist</a> and <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a> communities in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Millions of people moved to and from British colonies, with large numbers of <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">Indians</a> emigrating to other parts of the empire, such as <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, and Chinese people to Malaysia, Singapore and the Caribbean. The demographics of Britain itself was changed after the Second World War owing to <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20since%201922%23Post-war%20immigration%20%281945%E2%80%931983%29">immigration to Britain</a> from its former colonies.

Batman (1989 film)

Batman is a 1989 American <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> directed by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> and produced by <a href="Jon%20Peters">Jon Peters</a> and <a href="Peter%20Guber">Peter Guber</a>, based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> <a href="Batman">character of the same name</a>. It is the first installment of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>' <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29">initial "Batman" film series</a>. The film stars <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> as Bruce Wayne/Batman and <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> as <a href="Joker%20%28character%29">The Joker</a>, alongside <a href="Kim%20Basinger">Kim Basinger</a>, <a href="Robert%20Wuhl">Robert Wuhl</a>, <a href="Pat%20Hingle">Pat Hingle</a>, <a href="Billy%20Dee%20Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a>, <a href="Michael%20Gough">Michael Gough</a> and <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a>. The film takes place early in the title character's war on crime, and depicts a battle with his arch-nemesis the Joker.

After Burton was hired as director in 1986, <a href="Steve%20Englehart">Steve Englehart</a> and <a href="Julie%20Hickson">Julie Hickson</a> wrote <a href="film%20treatment">film treatment</a>s before <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a> wrote the first screenplay. "Batman" was not <a href="greenlight">greenlit</a> until after the success of Burton's "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>" (1988). Numerous <a href="A-list">A-list</a> actors were considered for the role of Batman before Keaton was cast. Keaton's casting caused a controversy since, by 1988, he had become <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role. Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the <a href="box%20office">box office</a> profits and his shooting schedule.

The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="Brian%20Bolland">Brian Bolland</a>'s "" and <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>". The film primarily adapts the "<a href="The%20Man%20Behind%20the%20Red%20Hood%21">Red Hood</a>" <a href="origin%20story">origin story</a> for the Joker, in which Batman creates the Joker by dropping him into <a href="Axis%20Chemical">Axis Chemical</a> acid, resulting in his transformation into a psychopath, but it adds a unique twist in presenting him specifically as a <a href="gangster">gangster</a> named Jack Napier. Filming took place at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>30 million to $48 million, while the <a href="1988%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">1988 Writers Guild of America strike</a> forced Hamm to drop out. <a href="Warren%20Skaaren">Warren Skaaren</a> did rewrites. Additional uncredited drafts were done by <a href="Charles%20McKeown">Charles McKeown</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Gems">Jonathan Gems</a>.

"Batman" was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a> nominations and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> nomination, and won an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>. It also inspired the equally successful "", paving the way for the <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">DC animated universe</a>, and has influenced <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>'s modern marketing and development techniques of the <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> genre. Three sequels, "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>", "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>" and "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>", were released on June 19, 1992, June 16, 1995, and June 20, 1997, respectively.

As <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> approaches its <a href="wikt%3Abicentennial">bicentennial</a>, Mayor Borg orders district attorney <a href="Harvey%20Dent">Harvey Dent</a> and police commissioner <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James Gordon</a> to make the city safer. Meanwhile, reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a> begin to investigate rumors of a vigilante nicknamed "<a href="Batman">Batman</a>" who is targeting the city's criminals.

Batman's alter-ego is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a psychotic mugger. At a fundraiser for the bicentennial in Wayne Manor, Bruce meets and falls for Vale, and the two begin a romantic relationship. However, the evening is cut short as Bruce is alerted to Commissioner Gordon's sudden departure due to police business and leaves to investigate as Batman.

Mob boss Carl Grissom, who has already been targeted by Dent, discovers his mistress Alicia is involved with his second-in-command Jack Napier. With the help of corrupt police lieutenant Max Eckhardt, Grissom engineers Napier's death in a raid at <a href="Ace%20Chemicals">Axis Chemicals</a>. However, Grissom's plan is foiled with the sudden arrival of Commissioner Gordon, who wants Napier captured alive. In the ensuing shootout, Napier, who has realized he was set up, kills Eckhardt. Batman arrives and, in a struggle, Napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals. Batman escapes and Napier is presumed dead.

Napier emerges from the vat, but is left disfigured with chalk white skin, emerald green hair, and a <a href="rictus%20grin">rictus grin</a>. The sociopathic Napier is driven insane by the incident and begins calling himself <a href="Joker%20%28character%29">"the Joker"</a>. He kills Grissom and usurps authority over his criminal empire, and scars Alicia's face to equal his disfigurement.

The Joker terrorizes Gotham City by lacing hygiene products with ""Smilex"", a deadly chemical which causes victims to <a href="die%20laughing">die laughing</a> with the same maniacal grin as the Joker. As he searches for information on Batman, the Joker also becomes obsessed with Vale. He lures her to the Gotham Museum of Art and his henchmen <a href="Vandalism">destroy the works of art</a>. Batman arrives and rescues her. They escape in the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, pursued by the Joker's men. Batman takes Vicki to the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a>, where he gives her information from his research on Smilex that will allow the city's residents to avoid exposure to the toxin.

Bruce visits Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her about his alter-ego. The Joker interrupts their meeting, asking Bruce, "(Have you) Ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?" before shooting him. Bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead. He remembers that the mugger who killed his parents asked the same question, and realizes that Napier was his parents' killer. Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised, also attacks them with Smilex gas released from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the <a href="Batplane">Batwing</a>. The Joker shoots the Batwing using a long-barreled gun, causing it to crash, and takes Vicki to the top of a cathedral.

Batman, who survived the crash, fends off the Joker's remaining men despite his injuries, and confronts the Joker. The two struggle, with Joker eventually gaining the upper hand, leaving Batman and Vicki clinging onto an outcropping. The Joker tries to escape by helicopter, but Batman attaches a heavy granite <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a> to the Joker's leg with his grappling hook, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off.

Commissioner Gordon announces that the police have arrested the Joker's men and unveils the <a href="Bat-Signal">Bat-Signal</a>. Harvey Dent reads a note from Batman, promising that he will defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Vicki is taken to <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a> by Alfred, who tells her that Bruce will be a little late. She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection, standing watch over the city.

In the late 1970s, Batman's popularity was waning. <a href="CBS">CBS</a> was interested in producing a "Batman in Outer Space" film. Producers <a href="Benjamin%20Melniker">Benjamin Melniker</a> and <a href="Michael%20E.%20Uslan">Michael E. Uslan</a> purchased the <a href="film%20rights">film rights</a> of Batman from <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> on October 3, 1979. It was Uslan's wish "to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> and <a href="Bill%20Finger">Bill Finger</a> had envisioned him in 1939. A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows." <a href="Richard%20Maibaum">Richard Maibaum</a> was approached to write a script with <a href="Guy%20Hamilton">Guy Hamilton</a> to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitching</a> "Batman" to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the <a href="camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">1960s TV series</a>. <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> and <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> were among those to turn down the film.

A disappointed Uslan then wrote a script titled "Return of the Batman" to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>", which his script pre-dated by six years. In November 1979, producers <a href="Jon%20Peters">Jon Peters</a> and <a href="Peter%20Guber">Peter Guber</a> joined the project. Melniker and Uslan became executive producers. The four felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of "<a href="Superman%20%281978%20film%29">Superman</a>" (1978). Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched "Batman" to <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a>, but the studio turned it down. Though no movie studios were yet involved, the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the <a href="Comic%20Art%20Convention">Comic Art Convention</a> in New York. <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> decided to accept "Batman".

<a href="Tom%20Mankiewicz">Tom Mankiewicz</a> completed a script titled "The Batman" in June 1983, focusing on Batman and <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>'s origins, with the Joker and <a href="Rupert%20Thorne">Rupert Thorne</a> as villains, and <a href="Silver%20St.%20Cloud">Silver St. Cloud</a> as the romantic interest. Mankiewicz took inspiration from the <a href="limited%20series">limited series</a> "Batman: Strange Apparitions", written by <a href="Steve%20Englehart">Steve Englehart</a>. Comic book artist <a href="Marshall%20Rogers">Marshall Rogers</a>, who worked with Englehart on "Strange Apparitions", was hired for <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a>. "The Batman" was then announced in late 1983 for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million. Originally, Mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for Batman, <a href="William%20Holden">William Holden</a> for <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James Gordon</a>, <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> as <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, and <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> as <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">the Penguin</a>, whom Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature. Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would never come to pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz' script, including <a href="Ivan%20Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a> and <a href="Joe%20Dante">Joe Dante</a>. Reitman wanted to cast <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a> as Batman and <a href="Eddie%20Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> as Robin. Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on "Strange Apparitions". However, it was Mankiewicz's script that was still being used to guide the project.

After the financial success of "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Big%20Adventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a>" (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct "Batman". Burton had then-girlfriend <a href="Julie%20Hickson">Julie Hickson</a> write a new 30-page <a href="film%20treatment">film treatment</a>, feeling the previous script by Mankiewicz was <a href="camp%20%28style%29">campy</a>. The success of "The Dark Knight Returns" and "" rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both "The Dark Knight Returns" and "The Killing Joke". Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986. Like Mankiewicz's script, it was based on his own "Strange Apparitions", and included Silver St. Cloud, Dick Grayson, the Joker and Rupert Thorne, as well as a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> by the <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">Penguin</a>. Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986.

Burton approached <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a>, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay. Hamm decided not to use an <a href="origin%20story">origin story</a>, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that "unlocking the mystery" would become part of the storyline. He reasoned, "You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman." Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character. One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted, reducing it to a photo in the "Gotham Globe" newspaper seen in the film.

Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> greeted with positive feedback. Hamm's script was then <a href="Bootleg%20%28comics%29">bootleg</a>ged at various comic book stores in the United States. "Batman" was finally given the <a href="Green-light">greenlight</a> to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton's "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>" (1988). When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction "Batman" was going in. Hamm explained, "They hear Tim Burton's name and they think of "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Big%20Adventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a>". They hear Keaton's name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of "Batman", and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us." To combat negative reports on the film's production, Kane was hired as creative consultant.

Parallel to the "<a href="Superman%20%281978%20film%29">Superman</a>" casting, a who's who of <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood top stars</a> were considered for the role of Batman, including <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Costner">Kevin Costner</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>, <a href="Tom%20Selleck">Tom Selleck</a>, <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a>, <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Quaid">Dennis Quaid</a>. Burton was pressured by Warner Bros. to cast an obvious action movie star, and had approached <a href="Pierce%20Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a>, but he had no interest in playing a comic book character. Burton was originally interested in casting an unknown actor, and offered <a href="Ray%20Liotta">Ray Liotta</a> a chance to audition after having completed "<a href="Something%20Wild%20%281986%20film%29">Something Wild</a>", but Liotta declined, a decision he regrets. <a href="Willem%20Dafoe">Willem Dafoe</a>, who was falsely reported to be considered for the Joker, had actually been considered for Batman early in development. Producer Jon Peters suggested Michael Keaton, arguing he had the right "edgy, tormented quality" after having seen his dramatic performance in "<a href="Clean%20and%20Sober">Clean and Sober</a>". Having directed Keaton in "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>", Burton agreed.

Keaton's casting caused a controversy among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. "Obviously there was a negative response from the comic book people. I think they thought we were going to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from "<a href="Mr.%20Mom">Mr. Mom</a>" and "<a href="Night%20Shift%20%28film%29">Night Shift</a>" and stuff like that." Keaton studied "The Dark Knight Returns" for inspiration.

<a href="Brad%20Dourif">Brad Dourif</a>, <a href="Tim%20Curry">Tim Curry</a>, <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="John%20Lithgow">John Lithgow</a> and <a href="James%20Woods">James Woods</a> were considered for the Joker. Lithgow, during his audition, attempted to talk Burton out of casting him, a decision he would later publicly regret, stating, "I didn’t realize it was such a big deal". Burton wanted to cast <a href="Brad%20Dourif">Brad Dourif</a>, but the studio refused. <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> lobbied hard for the part. Jack Nicholson had been producer Michael Uslan's and Bob Kane's choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of "<a href="The%20Witches%20of%20Eastwick%20%28film%29">The Witches of Eastwick</a>". Nicholson had what was known as an "off-the-clock" agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming, as well as being off for <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> home games. Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days. He received a $6 million salary, as well as a large percentage of the <a href="box%20office">box office</a> gross estimated between $60 million to $90 million.

<a href="Sean%20Young">Sean Young</a> was originally cast as Vicki Vale, but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Young's departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested <a href="Kim%20Basinger">Kim Basinger</a>: she was able to join the production immediately and was cast. As a fan of <a href="Michael%20Gough">Michael Gough</a>'s work in various <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a>, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne's butler, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>. <a href="Robert%20Wuhl">Robert Wuhl</a> was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character was originally supposed to die by the Joker's poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers "liked [my] character so much," Wuhl said, "that they decided to let me live." Burton chose <a href="Billy%20Dee%20Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a> as <a href="Harvey%20Dent">Harvey Dent</a> because he wanted to include the villain <a href="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept, but <a href="Tommy%20Lee%20Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a> was later cast in the role for "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>", which disappointed Williams. Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast his close friend <a href="Tracey%20Walter">Tracey Walter</a> as the Joker's henchman, Bob. <a href="Kiefer%20Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a> was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script. The rest of the cast included <a href="Pat%20Hingle">Pat Hingle</a> as <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">Commissioner Gordon</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Hall">Jerry Hall</a> as Alicia Hunt, <a href="Lee%20Wallace%20%28actor%29">Lee Wallace</a> as Mayor Borg, <a href="William%20Hootkins">William Hootkins</a> as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> as crime boss Carl Grissom.

The filmmakers considered filming "Batman" entirely on the Warner Bros. <a href="backlot">backlot</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>, but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> in <a href="England">England</a> from October 1988 to January 1989. 18 <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s were used, almost the entirety of Pinewood's 95-acre backlot. Locations included <a href="Knebworth%20House">Knebworth House</a> and <a href="Hatfield%20House">Hatfield House</a> doubling for <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>, plus <a href="Acton%20Lane%20Power%20Station">Acton Lane Power Station</a> and <a href="Little%20Barford%20Power%20Station">Little Barford Power Station</a>. The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million. Filming was highly secretive. The unit <a href="publicist">publicist</a> was offered and refused <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes' worth) were stolen. With various problems during filming, Burton called it "torture. The worst period of my life!"

Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the <a href="1988%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">1988 Writers Guild of America strike</a>. <a href="Warren%20Skaaren">Warren Skaaren</a>, who had also worked on Burton's "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>", did rewrites. <a href="Jonathan%20Gems">Jonathan Gems</a> and <a href="Charles%20McKeown">Charles McKeown</a> rewrote the script during filming. Only Skaaren received screenplay credit with Hamm. Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros. Burton explained, "I don't understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work." Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot. Bob Kane supported this decision.

Keaton, who called himself a "logic freak", was concerned that Batman's secret identity would in reality be fairly easy to uncover, and discussed ideas with Burton to better disguise the character, including the use of <a href="contact%20lenses">contact lenses</a>. Ultimately, Keaton decided to perform Batman's voice at a lower register than when he was portraying Bruce Wayne, which became a hallmark of the film version of the character, with <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> later using the same technique.

Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it when you get to the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know."

Burton was impressed with <a href="Anton%20Furst">Anton Furst</a>'s designs in "<a href="The%20Company%20of%20Wolves">The Company of Wolves</a>", and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for "Beetlejuice". Furst had been too committed on "<a href="High%20Spirits%20%28film%29">High Spirits</a>", a choice he later regretted. Furst enjoyed working with Burton. "I don't think I've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director", he said. "Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at."

Furst and the <a href="art%20department">art department</a> deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest <a href="metropolis">metropolis</a> imaginable". Furst continued, "[W]e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film "<a href="Brazil%20%281985%20film%29">Brazil</a>" by <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. <a href="Derek%20Meddings">Derek Meddings</a> served as the <a href="visual%20effects%20supervisor">visual effects supervisor</a>, while <a href="Keith%20Short">Keith Short</a> helped construct the newly created <a href="Batmobile%23Batman%20and%20Batman%20Returns">1989 Batmobile</a>, adding two <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">Browning machine gun</a>s. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the <a href="Bonneville%20Salt%20Flats">Salt Flat Racers</a> of the 30s and the <a href="Chevrolet%20Corvette%20%28C2%29">Sting Ray macho machines</a> of the 50s". The car was built upon a <a href="Chevrolet%20Impala">Chevrolet Impala</a> when previous development with a <a href="Jaguar%20Cars">Jaguar</a> and <a href="Ford%20Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> failed.

<a href="Costume%20design">Costume design</a>er <a href="Bob%20Ringwood">Bob Ringwood</a> turned down the chance to work on "<a href="Licence%20to%20Kill">Licence to Kill</a>" in favor of "Batman". Ringwood found it difficult designing the <a href="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> because "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build", he stated. "The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature." Burton commented, "Michael is a bit <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobic</a>, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a> with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. <a href="Prosthetic%20makeup">Prosthetic makeup</a> designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.

Burton hired <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>, his collaborator on "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" and "Beetlejuice", to compose the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given "The Dark Knight Returns". Elfman was worried, as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> to write music for the Joker and <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.

Burton protested the ideas, citing "my movies aren't commercial like "<a href="Top%20Gun">Top Gun</a>"." Elfman enlisted the help of <a href="Oingo%20Boingo">Oingo Boingo</a> lead guitarist <a href="Steve%20Bartek">Steve Bartek</a> and <a href="Shirley%20Walker">Shirley Walker</a> to arrange the compositions for the orchestra. Elfman was later displeased with the <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28film%20and%20television%29">audio mixing</a> of his film score. ""Batman" was done in England by technicians who didn't care, and the non-caring showed," he stated. "I'm not putting down England because they've done gorgeous <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubs</a> there, but this particular crew elected not to." "Batman" was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman's score. Both were successful, and compilations of Elfman's <a href="opening%20credits">opening credits</a> were used in the <a href="title%20sequence">title sequence</a> theme for "", also composed by Shirley Walker.

When discussing the central <a href="theme%20%28arts%29">theme</a> of "Batman", director Tim Burton explained, "the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people", adding that "The Joker is such a great character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society".

Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world. Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an <a href="antihero">antihero</a>. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker. <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> theorized that "Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent".

"Batman" conveys trademarks found in 1930s <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> design. <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a>, writing for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as "<a href="Metropolis%20%281927%20film%29">Metropolis</a>" (1927) and "<a href="The%20Cabinet%20of%20Dr.%20Caligari">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>" (1920). "Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio <a href="backlot">backlot</a>", he continued, "is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a> and <a href="fascist%20architecture">fascist architecture</a>, staring down at the citizens." Hanke further addressed the notions of "Batman" being a <a href="period%20piece">period piece</a>, in that "The citizens, cops, people and the <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> television looks like it takes place in 1939"; but later said: "Had the filmmakers made <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a> a <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> rather than a <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a>, this could have made "Batman" as a homage and tribute to classic <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>." Portions of the <a href="climax%20%28narrative%29">climax</a> pay homage to "<a href="Vertigo%20%28film%29">Vertigo</a>".

Production designer Anton Furst designed the poster, which he called "evocative but ubiquitous. Only featuring the Bat-Symbol. Not too much and not too little". Earlier designs "had the word 'Batman' spelled in "<a href="RoboCop">RoboCop</a>" or "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>"-type font". Jon Peters unified all the film's <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a>s, even turning down $6 million from <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> to build the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> because the car company would not relinquish creative control.

During production, Peters read in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first <a href="film%20trailer">film trailer</a> that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but happened to create enormous anticipation for the film. <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own <a href="limited%20series">comic book miniseries</a>. Hamm's stories were collected in the <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> "Batman: Blind Justice" (). <a href="Denys%20Cowan">Denys Cowan</a> and <a href="Dick%20Giordano">Dick Giordano</a> illustrated the artwork. "Blind Justice" tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to <a href="Wayne%20Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>. It also marks the first appearance of <a href="Henri%20Ducard">Henri Ducard</a>, who was later used in the <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a>ed "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>", albeit as an alias for the more notable <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a>.

In the months pre-dating "Batman"s release in June 1989, a <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> phenomenon rose known as "<a href="Lisztomania%23Creation%20and%20use%20of%20the%20term">Batmania</a>". Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold. <a href="Cult%20film">Cult film</a>maker and comic book writer <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> remembered: "That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot." <a href="Hachette%20Book%20Group%20USA">Hachette pageRank.Book Group USA</a> published a novelization, "Batman" written by <a href="Craig%20Shaw%20Gardner">Craig Shaw Gardner</a>. It remained on the <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller list</a> throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Observer">The New York Observer</a>" categorized "Batman" as a <a href="high%20concept">high concept</a> film. He believed "it is less movie than a corporate <a href="behemoth">behemoth</a>".

"Batman" opened on June 23, 1989, grossing $43.6 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend record, set by "<a href="Ghostbusters%20II">Ghostbusters II</a>" one week earlier, with $29.4 million. The film closed on December 14, 1989, with a final gross $251.2 million in North America and $160.15 million internationally, totaling $411.35 million. "Batman" was the first film to earn $100 million in its first ten days of release, and was the highest grossing <a href="List%20of%20films%20based%20on%20DC%20Comics">film based on a DC comic book</a> until 2008's "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>". The film's gross is the 66th highest ever in North American ranks. Although "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>" made the most money worldwide in 1989, "Batman" was able to beat "The Last Crusade" in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, and made a further $150 million in <a href="home%20video">home video</a> sales. <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> estimates that the film sold more than 60 million tickets in the US.

"Batman" was criticized by some for being too dark, but nonetheless received positive reviews from critics. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 68 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "An eerie, haunting spectacle, "Batman" succeeds as dark entertainment, even if Jack Nicholson's Joker too often overshadows the title character." <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gives an aggregated score of 66 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.

Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering <a href="Thomas%20Wayne">Thomas</a> and <a href="Martha%20Wayne">Martha Wayne</a>; in the comic book, <a href="Joe%20Chill">Joe Chill</a> is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a>. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>," Hamm said.

The songs written by Prince were criticized for being "too out of place". While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film. On the film, Burton remarked, "I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie."

Despite initial negative reactions from comics fans prior to the film's release, Keaton's portrayal of Batman was generally praised. <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, "the best thing that can be said about "Batman" is that it led to "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>", which was a far superior effort." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" felt "Jack Nicholson stole every scene" but still greeted the film with positive feedback. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed ""Batman" is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about." He also called the film "a depressing experience". His reviewing partner <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> disagreed, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws you into a psychological world'.

<a href="Anton%20Furst">Anton Furst</a> and <a href="Peter%20Young%20%28set%20decorator%29">Peter Young</a> won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Art%20Direction">Academy Award for Best Art Direction</a>, while Nicholson was nominated for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy)</a>. The <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> nominated "Batman" in six categories (<a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Production%20Design">Production Design</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Visual%20Effects">Visual Effects</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume%20Design">Costume Design</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Makeup%20and%20Hair">Makeup</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound">Sound</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Actor in a Supporting Role</a> for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories. Nicholson, Basinger, the makeup department, and <a href="costume%20designer">costume designer</a> <a href="Bob%20Ringwood">Bob Ringwood</a> all received nominations at the <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a>s. The film was also nominated for the <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Fantasy%20Film">Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film</a> and the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation">Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation</a>.

The success of "Batman" prompted <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a> to create the acclaimed "", as a result beginning the long-running <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">DC animated universe</a> and helped establish the modern day <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> genre. Series co-creator <a href="Bruce%20Timm">Bruce Timm</a> stated the television show's <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, "our show would never have gotten made if it hadn't been for that first "Batman" movie." Burton joked, "ever since I did "Batman", it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I'm the one responsible for that trend."

"Batman" initiated the <a href="Batman%20in%20film%23Tim%20Burton/Joel%20Schumahcer">original "Batman" film series</a> and spawned three sequels: "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>" (1992), "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>" (1995) and "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>" (1997); the latter two of which were directed by <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> and <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, respectively.

Executive producers <a href="Benjamin%20Melniker">Benjamin Melniker</a> and <a href="Michael%20E.%20Uslan">Michael E. Uslan</a> filed a <a href="breach%20of%20contract">breach of contract</a> lawsuit in <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Board%20of%20Supervisors">Los Angeles County Superior Court</a> on March 26, 1992. Melniker and Uslan claimed to be "the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of "Batman" and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of "Batman"." A <a href="superior%20court">superior court</a> judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of "Batman" have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have "not seen a penny more than that since our <a href="net%20profit">net profit</a> participation has proved worthless." Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Melniker and Uslan's attorney as "two popcorns and two <a href="Coca-Cola">Coke</a>s".

Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that "Batman" has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA</a> <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">PG-13</a> as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.

The <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> anointed Batman the 46th greatest movie hero and the Joker the 45th greatest movie villain on "<a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Heroes%20and%20Villains">AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains</a>".


Many versions of the film have been released. Included are <a href="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>, single-disc <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, special edition DVD and an anthology set. The "Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology" released in 2005 included 2-disc special edition DVDs of the Tim Burton/<a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> "Batman" films. This anthology set was re-released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> on March 10, 2009.

On May 19, 2009 a 20th anniversary stand-alone edition was released. This stand-alone version contains exactly the same special features as its anthology set (both DVD and Blu-ray) counterparts. There are two differences: This version includes a 50-page booklet guide to the film, and a slight variation in packaging from normal Blu-ray cases (i.e. a Warner Bros. <a href="digital%20book">digibook</a>). They both include a digital copy of the film.

Warner Bros. also released the 25th anniversary edition on Blu Ray on December 20, 2014 with all of the same special features shown on DVD and Blu Ray and comes with a new featurette called "Batman: The Birth of the Modern Blockbuster".

The film was also included in "The Tim Burton Collection" DVD/Blu-ray set in 2012, alongside its sequel, "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>", and several other Burton films.

Batman (1966 film)

Batman (often promoted as Batman: The Movie) is a 1966 American <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> based on the <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">"Batman" television series</a>, and the first full-length theatrical adaptation of the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> character <a href="Batman">Batman</a>. Released by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, the film starred <a href="Adam%20West">Adam West</a> as Batman and <a href="Burt%20Ward">Burt Ward</a> as <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a>. The film hit theaters two months after the of the television series. The film includes most members of the original TV cast, with the exception of <a href="Lee%20Meriwether">Lee Meriwether</a> as the Catwoman, the character previously played by <a href="Julie%20Newmar">Julie Newmar</a> in two episodes of the series' first season.

When Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the <a href="batcopter">batcopter</a>. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht, it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-<a href="shark%20repellent">shark repellent</a>, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> (<a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">The Joker</a>, <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">The Penguin</a>, <a href="Riddler">The Riddler</a>, and <a href="Catwoman">The Catwoman</a>).

The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a <a href="penguin">penguin</a>, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. The Catwoman, disguised as <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> journalist "Miss Kitka", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a> along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> once struck: The Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a>, used to recharge the Batcave's <a href="atomic%20pile">atomic pile</a>.

Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United World Organization's Security Council</a>. Giving chase in the <a href="batboat">batboat</a> to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his "true love" Miss Kitka is actually the Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.

Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.

With the world watching, the <a href="Security%20Council">Security Council</a> is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, continuing to squabble among themselves and totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leave <a href="United%20Nations%20Headquarters">United World Headquarters</a> by climbing out of the window.

The film includes most members of the original TV cast: the actors for Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, O'Hara, Aunt Harriet, the Joker, the Penguin, and the Riddler all reprised their roles. Though <a href="Julie%20Newmar">Julie Newmar</a> had at this point played <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> in two episodes of in the <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">TV series</a>, she had other commitments at that time and was replaced by <a href="Lee%20Meriwether">Lee Meriwether</a> in the film. According to the <a href="Biography%20%28TV%20Series%29">Biography</a> special <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>: Her Many Lives, aired on July 20, 2004, it was stated that Newmar was unable to reprise her role due to a reported back injury. <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> was nonetheless played by Newmar once again in the following eleven episodes of of the series; <a href="Eartha%20Kitt">Eartha Kitt</a> would then play <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> in three episodes of .

In his autobiography, <a href="Adam%20West">Adam West</a> writes of his asking for more money to do the film and that the producers countered with the fact that another actor would be hired. "Batman" was Denny's final film appearance. <a href="Jack%20LaLanne">Jack LaLanne</a> has a cameo as a man on a rooftop with bikini-clad women.

<a href="William%20Dozier">William Dozier</a> wanted to make a big-screen film to generate interest in his proposed <a href="Batman">Batman</a> TV series by having the feature in theaters while the first season of the series was rolling before the cameras. The studio, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, refused because it would have to cover the entire cost of a movie, while it would only have to share the cost of a TV series (a much less risky proposition).

The film features many characters from the show. It was written by series writer <a href="Lorenzo%20Semple%2C%20Jr.">Lorenzo Semple, Jr.</a> and directed by <a href="Leslie%20H.%20Martinson">Leslie H. Martinson</a>. Martinson had directed a pair of the television series season one episodes: "The Penguin Goes Straight" and "Not Yet, He Ain't".

Even though it is often described (like many contemporary shows) as a parody of a popular comic-book character, some commentators believe that its comedy is not so tightly confined. They felt the film's depiction of the Caped Crusader "captured the feel of the contemporary comics perfectly". The film was, they remind us, made at a time when "the Batman of the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Comic%20Books">Golden Age comics</a> was already essentially neutered."

Certain elements verge into direct parody of the history of Batman. The movie, like the TV series, is strongly influenced by the comparatively obscure 1940s serials of Batman, such as the escapes done almost out of luck. The penchant for giving devices a "Bat-" prefix and the dramatic use of stylized title cards during fight scenes acknowledge some of the conventions that the character had accumulated in various media. However, the majority of "Batman"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> campier moments can be read as a broader parody on contemporary mid-1960s culture in general.

Furthermore, the movie represented Batman's first major foray into <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> issues paying heavy attention to <a href="UGM-27%20Polaris">Polaris Missiles</a>, <a href="War%20surplus">war surplus submarines</a> and taking a poke at <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>. The inclusion of a glory-hunting presidential character and the unfavorable portrayal of Security Council Members marked Batman's first attempts to poke fun at domestic and international politics.

Besides the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, other vehicles used by The Dynamic Duo include:

Of the three new Batvehicles which first appeared in the "Batman" film, only the <a href="Batcycle">Batcycle</a> properly crossed over into the <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">TV series</a> as the budgetary limits of the TV series precluded the full use of the others. While the <a href="Batcopter">Batcopter</a> and <a href="Batboat">Batboat</a> from the movie appeared briefly in episodes (including a use of the Batboat in the conclusion of the first post-film two-parter: "<a href="Walk%20the%20Straight%20and%20Narrow">Walk the Straight and Narrow</a>"), they primarily did in the form of stock-footage scenes from the film intercut into the series.

<a href="Nelson%20Riddle">Nelson Riddle</a>'s original score to "Batman the Movie" was released in 2010 by <a href="La-La%20Land%20Records">La-La Land Records</a> and <a href="Fox%20Music">Fox Music</a>. The album contains the entire score as heard in the film in chronological order as well as an unreleased cue. This limited edition includes a lavishly illustrated color booklet which features exclusive liner notes by Brian Baterwhite. This Limited Edition was of 2000 units.

It was newly re-issued in 2016. While the program and master of this release is identical to the 2010 release, this reissue features all-new exclusive liner notes by John Takis and art design by Jim Titus. This new Limited Edition is of 2500 units.

"<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine stated on their review that "the intense innocent enthusiasm of Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith and Frank Gorshin as the three criminals is balanced against the innocent calm of Adam West and Burt Ward, Batman and Robin respectively."

Batman Returns is a 1992 American <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> directed by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> character <a href="Batman">Batman</a>. It is the second installment of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>' <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29">initial "Batman" film series</a>, with <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> reprising the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman.

Burton originally did not want to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a> which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with <a href="Daniel%20Waters%20%28screenwriter%29">Daniel Waters</a>. <a href="Wesley%20Strick">Wesley Strick</a> did an uncredited rewrite, removing <a href="Harvey%20Dent">Harvey Dent</a> and <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a> and rewriting the climax. <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer. Filming began in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.

"Batman Returns" was released on June 19, 1992. The film was nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Visual%20Effects">Best Visual Effects</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Makeup">Best Makeup</a>, as well as two <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> awards. Its budget was $80 million and it grossed $266.8 million worldwide, making the film a financial success. The film received generally positive reviews for its action sequences, acting, <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>'s score, effects, and villains, though the dark tone was less well received.

Tucker and Esther Cobblepot throw their deformed infant child Oswald into Gotham River, fearing he would become a menace to society after attacking their cat. His basket floats to an abandoned zoo and a rookery of penguins raise him as one of their own.

33 years later, in <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>, a gang of carnival performers stage a riot. While billionaire Bruce Wayne, as vigilante <a href="Batman">Batman</a>, subdues the criminals, corrupt businessman Max Shreck falls through a trapdoor and is brought to the underground lair of Copplepot, now the kingpin known as the <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">Penguin</a>. A former <a href="Freak%20show">sideshow freak</a>, Cobblepot blackmails Shreck into helping him become a respected citizen.

After Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers his plan to monopolize Gotham's electricity, he pushes her out of his office window. As she Kyle lies unconscious in an alley, a group of cats swarm around her and she regains consciousness. She develops <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a> and fashions a black vinyl costume and whip, becoming <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>. Shreck arranges for one of Cobblepot's men to kidnap the Mayor's infant son, allowing Cobblepot to "rescue" him. As a reward, Cobblepot is given access to the Gotham City Archives, where he learns his real name and that he is the last surviving member of his family. 

The Mayor, persuaded by Wayne, refuses to give Shreck a construction permit for his power plant. Cobblepot orders his gang to attack downtown Gotham, ruining the Mayor's reputation and giving Shreck the opportunity to propose Cobblepot as a replacement. Batman confronts him, but Catwoman firebombs Shreck's department store and Cobblepot escapes. Batman and Catwoman get into a fight in which Batman almost kills Catwoman but saves her. Catwoman then seduces Batman in a sexy way and stabs him in the ribs. After this, Batman knocks her off a building and Catwoman survives by landing in a truck of kitty litter.

Kyle enters a romantic relationship with Wayne. As Catwoman, she agrees to help Cobblepot by framing Batman for the abduction of Gotham's "Ice Princess" beauty queen. While Batman traverses the rooftops in search of the Ice Princess, Penguin's goons disassemble the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> and plant a device in the car that will allow the Cobblepot to control it. Distracted by Catwoman, Batman is unable to stop Cobblepot from attacking the Princess using a swarm of captive bats. She falls to her death before Batman can save her, making everyone believe that Batman pushed her. 

When Catwoman rejects Cobblepot's advances, he attacks her with his helicopter umbrella. Fleeing the police, Batman realizes that Cobblepot is remotely controlling the Batmobile, taking it on a rampage through Gotham. Batman records the Penguin's insults about how gullible the Gotham citizens are and disables the device.

At a press conference for Cobblepot organized by Shreck, Batman broadcasts the recording, destroying Cobblepot's public image. Enraged, Cobblepot flees to the sewers and orders his gang to kidnap the <a href="Primogeniture">first-born sons</a> of Gotham. At a <a href="masquerade%20ball">masquerade ball</a> hosted by Shreck, Wayne and Kyle deduce each other's secret identities. Cobblepot invades the party, revealing his intention to drown the kidnapped children, including Shreck's son Chip, in sewage, prompting Shreck to offer himself instead. Batman defeats the kidnappers and Cobblepot unleashes an army of penguin soldiers to destroy Gotham with missiles. Piloting the Batboat through the sewers, Batman redirects the penguins to fire on Cobblepot's hideout. Cobblepot attacks Batman in a rage, but is assaulted by bats and falls into the toxic water.

Catwoman ambushes Shreck in an attempt to kill him, but Batman stops her and unmask himself. Catwoman removes her own masks when she rejects Wayne's attempts to reason with her. Shreck shoots Wayne and Kyle, leaving them wounded. Putting a taser to his lips, Kyle kisses Shreck while grabbing an exposed power cable, electrocuting him. Wayne uncovers Shreck's corpse while digging through the rubble in an attempt to find Kyle. Cobblepot tries to kill Wayne with his umbrella, but dies from his injuries. His penguin family carry out a makeshift funeral.

As Wayne's butler <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred</a> drives Wayne home, Wayne spots a shadow resembling Catwoman. He follows it and finds her pet black cat, Miss Kitty. He decides to take it home. The <a href="Bat-Signal">Bat-Signal</a> lights up in the night sky as Catwoman watches from afar.

The protector of <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> and the Caped Crusader. Bruce struggles with his dual identity as a crime fighter, becoming romantically involved with Selina Kyle, alias Catwoman. Keaton earned $11 million for reprising his role as the Caped Crusader as director <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> thought that Keaton deserved it. "Batman Returns" was Keaton's final film as <a href="Batman">Batman</a>, as he was subsequently replaced by <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> and <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a> in "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>" and "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>" respectively.
A psycopathic, deformed man who was abandoned by his parents when he was a baby. Raised by penguins of an abandoned zoo, thirty-three years later, he returns for revenge along with the Red Triangle Circus Gang after being cheated by businessman Max Shreck. DeVito was suggested for the role by his friend <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> after the financial success of <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">the first film,</a> in which Nicholson played <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">The Joker</a>. According to DeVito, "It was four-and-a-half hours of makeup and getting into the costume. We got it down to three hours by the end of the shoot". <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> was originally the first choice to play <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">The Penguin,</a> but he declined. Apart from Hoffman, famous actors <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, <a href="John%20Candy">John Candy</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hoskins">Bob Hoskins</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Waite">Ralph Waite</a>, <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>, <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a>, <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>, <a href="John%20Goodman">John Goodman</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Lee">Christopher Lee</a>, <a href="Joe%20Pesci">Joe Pesci</a>, <a href="Ray%20Liotta">Ray Liotta</a>, <a href="Gabriel%20Byrne">Gabriel Byrne</a>, <a href="Alex%20Rocco">Alex Rocco</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> were all considered for the part before DeVito got it.
A normal woman who becomes a criminal after being almost killed by her boss Max Shreck, who later decides to try everything to kill her. She is held as a <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> in the most of the film. According to Michelle Pfeiffer, who was previously considered to play <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a> in the <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">previous film,</a> she felt devastated after <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> was cast as Catwoman. However, Bening became pregnant, allowing Pfeiffer to get the role. Pfeiffer's $3 million salary was $2 million more than was offered to Bening. To prepare for the role, Pfeiffer attended <a href="kickboxing">kickboxing</a> classes and practised handling a <a href="whip">whip</a> (during which she accidentally cut her teacher's chin). <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a> (who was considered "too old" by Burton), <a href="Brooke%20Shields">Brooke Shields</a> (who Burton considered "not bankable"), <a href="Demi%20Moore">Demi Moore</a>, <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> (who ended up playing Dr. Chase Meridian in "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>"), <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a>, <a href="Geena%20Davis">Geena Davis</a>, <a href="Sigourney%20Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a>, <a href="Lena%20Olin">Lena Olin</a>, singer <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Raquel%20Welch">Raquel Welch</a>, <a href="Cher">Cher</a>, <a href="Ellen%20Barkin">Ellen Barkin</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, <a href="Lorraine%20Bracco">Lorraine Bracco</a>, <a href="Bridget%20Fonda">Bridget Fonda</a> and <a href="Jennifer%20Beals">Jennifer Beals</a> were also considered for the role, but they lost out to Pfeiffer.
A wealthy businessman and industrialist known as "The Santa Claus of Gotham". He is obsessed with building a power chemical plant in Gotham City, but when both Bruce Wayne and the Mayor of Gotham City deny his idea, he decides to help <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">Oswald Cobblepot</a> to become the new mayor of Gotham City for his plans. Apart from being the father of Chip Shreck and presumably killing his wife to gain her money, Shreck is also the former employer of Selina Kyle, who wants to kill him following his attempt to kill her. The character was created by writer <a href="Daniel%20Waters%20%28screenwriter%29">Daniel Waters</a> and named in-joke after the late German actor <a href="Max%20Schreck">Max Schreck</a>, who starred in "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>". Apart from this, Shreck fulfils what would have been <a href="Two%20Face">Harvey Dent</a>'s role if <a href="Billy%20Dee%20Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a> hadn't opted out this film. Singer <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, who was previously considered to play <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">The Joker</a> in the <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">first film,</a> was in contention for the role of Shreck, but he declined in order to appear in <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>'s "".

After the success of "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>", <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a>. They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> originally did not want to direct another film in the franchise. "I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting", he said in 1989. "Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea." Burton decided to direct "<a href="Edward%20Scissorhands">Edward Scissorhands</a>" for <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a> from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> was brought back as a creative consultant. Hamm's script had the <a href="Penguin%20%28character%29">Penguin</a> and <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> going after hidden treasure.

Burton was impressed with <a href="Daniel%20Waters%20%28screenwriter%29">Daniel Waters</a>' work on "<a href="Heathers">Heathers</a>"; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>". Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control. <a href="Denise%20Di%20Novi">Denise Di Novi</a> and Burton became the film's producers. The first film's producers <a href="Jon%20Peters">Jon Peters</a> and <a href="Peter%20Guber">Peter Guber</a> became executive producers, joining <a href="Benjamin%20Melniker">Benjamin Melniker</a> and <a href="Michael%20E.%20Uslan">Michael E. Uslan</a>. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters. Waters "came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin", Waters reported. "I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes." The subplot of Penguin running for Mayor came from <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">the 1960s TV series</a> episodes "Hizzoner the Penguin" and "Dizzoner the Penguin". Waters wrote a total of five drafts.

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained "Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." <a href="Two-Face">Harvey Dent</a> appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." In early scripts Max Shreck was the "golden boy" of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor <a href="Max%20Schreck">Max Schreck</a>, known for his role as <a href="Count%20Orlok">Count Orlok</a> in "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>".

Burton hired <a href="Wesley%20Strick">Wesley Strick</a> to do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, "When I was hired to write "Batman Returns" ("Batman II" at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming, or freezing <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>, a plot point they would later use in "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>". Strick gained inspiration from a <a href="Moses">Moses</a> parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a> appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [Batman as] the loner of loners." Robin started out as a juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, which I notice they used in the <a href="Batman%20Forever">third film</a>!" <a href="Marlon%20Wayans">Marlon Wayans</a> was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.

<a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> returned after a significant increase in his salary to $10 million. <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> was cast as <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> after Burton saw her performance in "<a href="The%20Grifters%20%28film%29">The Grifters</a>", but she dropped out due to her pregnancy. <a href="Raquel%20Welch">Raquel Welch</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Jason%20Leigh">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Ellen%20Barkin">Ellen Barkin</a>, <a href="Cher">Cher</a>, <a href="Bridget%20Fonda">Bridget Fonda</a>, <a href="Lorraine%20Bracco">Lorraine Bracco</a>, <a href="Jennifer%20Beals">Jennifer Beals</a> and <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a> were then in competition for the role. <a href="Sean%20Young">Sean Young</a>, who was originally chosen for <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a> in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition. Burton was unfamiliar with <a href="Michelle%20Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>'s work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting. Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office. The actress undertook <a href="kickboxing">kickboxing</a> lessons for the role. <a href="Kathy%20Long">Kathy Long</a> served as Pfeiffer's <a href="body%20double">body double</a>. On <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>'s casting, Waters explained, "I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didn't really officially cast it, but for a short nasty little guy, it's a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito."

<a href="Burgess%20Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a> (who portrayed Penguin in the 1960s TV series "Batman") was cast for a little cameo as Tucker Cobblepot, Penguin's father, but illness prevented him from it and that role was taken by <a href="Paul%20Reubens">Paul Reubens</a>.

In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>s (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>) were being prepared for the filming of "Batman Returns". Filming started in June 1991. Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a>. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used. Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable. Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> sets.

<a href="Animal%20rights">Animal rights</a> groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the <a href="curator">curator</a> of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable. "On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees", recalls Hill. "In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees." According to the American Humane Association's On-Set Oversight, The six Emperor penguins that act as pallbearers for the Penguin's body at the end of the film, were little people dressed as Emperor penguins.

The streets of Gotham City use the old Brownstone Street and Hennessy Street on the Warners' backlot.

Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for "Batman Returns". The <a href="art%20department">art department</a> was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's <a href="Working%20title%23Title%20ruse">fake working title</a> "Dictel" to go anywhere near the sets. <a href="Kevin%20Costner">Kevin Costner</a> was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a <a href="private%20investigator">private investigator</a> to track down the accomplice. $65 million was spent during the production of "Batman Returns", while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million. The final shot of Catwoman looking at the <a href="Bat-Signal">Bat-Signal</a> was completed during <a href="post-production">post-production</a> and was not part of the <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a>. After "Batman Returns" was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a <a href="body%20double">body double</a> was chosen.

<a href="Bo%20Welch">Bo Welch</a>, Burton's collaborator on "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>" and "<a href="Edward%20Scissorhands">Edward Scissorhands</a>", replaced <a href="Anton%20Furst">Anton Furst</a> as <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a>, since Furst was unable to return for the sequel due to contractual obligations. Welch blended "<a href="Fascist%20architecture">Fascist architecture</a> with <a href="World%27s%20fair">World's fair</a> architecture" for Gotham City. He also studied <a href="Russian%20architecture">Russian architecture</a> and <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a>. An <a href="Iron%20maiden%20%28torture%29">iron maiden</a> was used for Bruce Wayne's entry into the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a>. <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a>, who worked with Burton on "Edward Scissorhands", designed <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>'s <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">prosthetic makeup</a>, which took two hours to apply. DeVito had to put a combination of <a href="mouthwash">mouthwash</a> and red/green <a href="food%20coloring">food coloring</a> in his mouth "to create a grotesque texture of some weird ooze."
More than 60 <a href="Catsuit">Catsuit</a>s were designed in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The <a href="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>". DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it easy for him to get into character. <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan">J. P. Morgan</a>'s wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's <a href="costume%20design">costume design</a>.

The bats were entirely composed of <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> since it was decided directing real bats on set would be problematic. The Penguin's "bird army" was a combination of CGI, robotic creatures, men in suits and even real penguins. Robotic penguin puppets were commissioned by Stan Winston. In total 30 <a href="African%20penguin">African penguin</a>s and 12 <a href="king%20penguin">king penguin</a>s were used. A <a href="miniature%20effect">miniature effect</a> was used for the exteriors of the Cobblepot Mansion in the opening scene and for <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>. The same method was used for <a href="Batboat">the Bat Ski-boat</a> and the exterior shots of the Gotham Zoo.

<a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a> had great enthusiasm for returning because "I didn't have to prove myself from the first film. I remember <a href="Jon%20Peters">Jon Peters</a> was very skeptical at first to hire me." Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. "When completing this movie I realized it was something of a <a href="film%20score">film score</a> and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average film score." Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the "scraping" on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, the relationship between the two strained, which — along with further "creative differences" on "<a href="The%20Nightmare%20Before%20Christmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>" — led Burton to use <a href="Howard%20Shore">Howard Shore</a> to score his next film "<a href="Ed%20Wood%20%28film%29">Ed Wood</a>". The musician co-orchestrated "<a href="Face%20to%20Face%20%28Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees%20song%29">Face to Face</a>", which was written and performed by <a href="Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>. The song can be heard in one scene during the film and during the end credits.

"Batman Returns" was released in America on June 19, 1992, earning $45.69 million in 2,644 theaters on its opening weekend. This was the highest opening weekend in 1992 and the highest opening weekend of any film up to that point. The film went on to gross $162.83 million in North America, and $104 million in foreign countries, coming to a worldwide total of $266.83 million. "Batman Returns" was the third highest-grossing film in America of 1992, and sixth highest in worldwide totals.

"Batman Returns" was criticized by some for being too dark and violent, but nonetheless received positive reviews. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Director Tim Burton's dark, brooding atmosphere, Michael Keaton's work as the tormented hero, and the flawless casting of Danny DeVito as The Penguin and Christopher Walken as, well, Christopher Walken make the sequel better than the first." Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.

<a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" thought that "Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark." She described Michael Keaton as showing "appropriate earnestness", <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a> as "conveying verve", Christopher Walken as "wonderfully debonair", Michelle Pfeiffer as "captivating... fierce, seductive", Bo Welch's production design as "dazzling", Stefan Czapsky's cinematography as "crisp", and <a href="Daniel%20Waters%20%28screenwriter%29">Daniel Waters</a>'s screenplay as "sharp."

<a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> in "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" wrote: "Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams." He praised the performances: "Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit; she's a classic dazzler... Michael Keaton's manic-depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation. And Danny DeVito's mutant Penguin—a balloon-bellied "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>" with a kingdom of sewer freaks—is as hilariously warped as <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>'s <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">Joker</a> and even quicker with the quips."

<a href="Desson%20Thomson">Desson Howe</a> in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" wrote: "Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere, he one-ups it, even two-ups it. He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, "<a href="The%20Phantom%20of%20the%20Opera">Phantom of the Opera</a>"-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a "Batman" movie. But "Returns" comes closer than ever to <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a>'s dark, original strip, which began in 1939." He described Walken as "engaging", DeVito as "exquisite" and Pfeiffer as "deliciously purry."

Todd McCarthy in "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote that "the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses." He praised the contributions of <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a>, <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>, Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that "the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains", calling DeVito "fascinating" and Pfeiffer "very tasty."

Conversely, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" gave the film two stars out of four, writing: "I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a "Batman" story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> don't go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes." He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> called DeVito "a pale substitute for <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> from the first film" and felt that "there's no suspense in "Batman Returns" whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist <a href="Matt%20Wagner">Matt Wagner</a> was quoted as saying: "I hated how "Batman Returns" made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." <a href="Ty%20Burr">Ty Burr</a> in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the film a B-; he wrote that "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by "Batman Returns": Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film."

A "parental backlash" criticized "Batman Returns" with violence and sexual references that were inappropriate for children despite being rated PG-13. <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> shut down their <a href="Happy%20Meal">Happy Meal</a> promotion for the film. Burton responded, "I like "Batman Returns" better than the first one. There was this big backlash that it was too dark, but I found this movie much less dark."

The film is recognized by <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> in these lists:
It was part of Empire's 500 Greatest Films in 2008 at number 401.

"Batman Returns" would be the last film in the Warner Bros. <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29">"Batman" film series</a> that featured Burton and <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> as director and leading actor. With "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>", Warner Bros. decided to go in a "lighter" direction to be more <a href="mainstream">mainstream</a> in the process of a <a href="family%20film">family film</a>. Burton had no interest in returning to direct a sequel, but was credited as producer. With Warner Bros. moving on development for "Batman Forever" in June 1993, a "Catwoman" <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> was announced. <a href="Michelle%20Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in "Forever" because of her own spin-off.

Burton became attached as director, while producer Denise Di Novi and writer <a href="Daniel%20Waters%20%28screenwriter%29">Daniel Waters</a> also returned. In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct "Catwoman" or an adaptation of "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Usher">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>". On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his "Catwoman" script to Warner Bros., the same day "Batman Forever" was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, "Turning it in the day "Batman Forever" opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. "Catwoman" is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script." In an August 1995 interview, Pfeiffer re-iterated her interest in the spin-off, but explained her priorities would be challenged as a mother and commitments to other projects. The film labored in <a href="development%20hell">development hell</a> for years, with Pfeiffer replaced by <a href="Ashley%20Judd">Ashley Judd</a>. The film ended up becoming the critically panned "<a href="Catwoman%20%28film%29">Catwoman</a>" (2004), starring <a href="Halle%20Berry">Halle Berry</a>.

Batman & Robin is a 1997 American <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> characters <a href="Batman">Batman</a> and <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Robin</a>. It is the fourth and final installment of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>' <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29">initial "Batman" film series</a>. The film was directed by <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> and written by <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a>. It stars <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, <a href="Chris%20O%27Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a>, <a href="Alicia%20Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a>, and <a href="Uma%20Thurman">Uma Thurman</a>. "Batman & Robin" tells the story of Batman and Robin as they attempt to prevent <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a> and <a href="Poison%20Ivy%20%28comics%29">Poison Ivy</a> from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. It is also to date the only live-action film appearance of <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, who helps the title characters fight the villains.

Warner Bros. fast-tracked development for "Batman & Robin" following the box office success of the previous film, "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>". Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on "<a href="A%20Time%20to%20Kill%20%281996%20film%29">A Time to Kill</a>", while <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with "<a href="The%20Saint%20%28film%29">The Saint</a>". Schumacher had a strong interest in casting <a href="William%20Baldwin">William Baldwin</a> in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the <a href="shooting%20schedule">shooting schedule</a>.

"Batman & Robin" premiered in Los Angeles on June 12, 1997 and went into general release on June 20, 1997. While it performed modestly at the box office, making $238.2 million worldwide against a production budget of $125 million, the film was a critical failure and is often considered to be one of the <a href="list%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20worst">worst films of all time</a>. It is also the lowest grossing live-action Batman movie to date. Due to the film's negative reception, Warner Bros. cancelled a sequel, "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29%23Batman%20Unchained">Batman Unchained</a>", and <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a>ed the film series with "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" in 2005. One of the songs recorded for the film, "<a href="The%20End%20Is%20the%20Beginning%20Is%20the%20End">The End Is the Beginning Is the End</a>" by <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Hard%20Rock%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance</a> at the <a href="40th%20Grammy%20Awards">40th Grammy Awards</a>.

In Gotham, one year after the defeat of Two-Face and the Riddler, Batman and Robin attempt to thwart <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a> from robbing diamonds from the natural history museum, but he steals one and flees. Mr. Freeze was originally Dr. Victor Fries, a doctor working to develop a cure for MacGregor's syndrome to heal his terminally ill <a href="Nora%20Fries">wife</a>. Fries was forced to wear a cryogenic suit powered by diamonds after becoming unable to live at normal temperatures following a lab accident. 

At a Wayne Enterprises lab in Brazil, the <a href="botanist">botanist</a> Dr. Pamela Isley is working under the deranged <a href="Dr.%20Jason%20Woodrue">Dr. Jason Woodrue</a>, experimenting with the <a href="List%20of%20comic%20book%20drugs%23Venom">Venom drug</a>. She witnesses Woodrue use the formula to turn the violent, but diminutive, convicted serial murderer Antonio Diego into a hulking monstrosity dubbed "<a href="Bane%20%28comics%29">Bane</a>". Woodrue and Isley argue over the use of the drug which ends when Woodrue attempts to kill her by overturning a shelf of various toxins. Despite Woodrue's efforts, she is resurrected, transforming into the beautiful and seductive Poison Ivy before exacting revenge; she kills Woodrue with her poisonous kiss. She finds that <a href="Wayne%20Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a> funded Woodrue, thus she appropriates Bane as a muscle-bound thug, taking him with her to <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>'s niece, Barbara Wilson, makes a surprise visit and is invited by Bruce Wayne to stay at <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a> until she goes back to school. 

Wayne Enterprises presents a new telescope at a press conference interrupted by Isley. She proposes a project that could help the environment, but Bruce declines her offer, which would kill millions of people. That night, a charity event is held by Wayne Enterprises with special guests, Batman and Robin, and she decides to use her abilities to seduce them. Freeze crashes the party and steals a diamond from the event. Although he is captured by Batman and detained in <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>, he eventually <a href="Prison%20escape">escape</a>s with the help of Ivy and Bane. Meanwhile, Dick discovers that Barbara has participated in drag races to raise money for Alfred, who is dying of MacGregor's syndrome. 

Batman and Robin begin to have crime fighting relationship problems because of Ivy's seductive ability with Robin, but Bruce convinces Dick to trust him. Ivy is then able to contact Robin once more; she kisses him but fails to kill him due to Robin wearing rubber lips. Meanwhile, Barbara discovers the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a>, where an AI version of Alfred reveals he has made Barbara her own suit. Barbara dons the suit and becomes <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>. Robin and later on Batman become trapped, but are rescued by Batgirl, who reveals her identity.

Batman, Robin and Batgirl decide to go after Freeze together. By the time they get to the observatory where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom to his body. Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him over the death of wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.


With the box office success of "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>" in June 1995, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> immediately commissioned a sequel. They hired director <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> and writer <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a> to reprise their duties the following August, and decided it was best to fast track production for a June 1997 target release date, which is a break from the usual 3-year gap between films. Schumacher wanted to <a href="Homage%20%28arts%29">homage</a> both the broad <a href="camp%20%28style%29">camp style</a> of the <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">1960s television series</a> and the work of <a href="Dick%20Sprang">Dick Sprang</a>. The storyline of "Batman & Robin" was conceived by Schumacher and Goldsman during <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a> on "<a href="A%20Time%20to%20Kill%20%28film%29">A Time to Kill</a>". Portions of Mr. Freeze's <a href="back-story">back-story</a> were based on the "" episode "", written by <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a>.

While <a href="Chris%20O%27Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a> reprises the role of <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Robin</a>, <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> decided not to reprise the role of Batman from "Batman Forever". Schumacher admitted he had difficulty working with Kilmer on "Forever". "He sort of quit," Schumacher said, "and we sort of fired him." Kilmer said he was not aware of the fast track production and was already committed to "<a href="The%20Saint%20%28film%29">The Saint</a>" (1997). Schumacher originally had a strong interest in casting <a href="William%20Baldwin">William Baldwin</a> in Kilmer's place, but <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a> was cast instead. Schumacher believed Clooney could provide a lighter interpretation of the character than <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> (in "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>" and "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>") and Kilmer. The <a href="shooting%20schedule">shooting schedule</a> allowed Clooney to simultaneously work on "<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>" without any scheduling conflicts.

<a href="Patrick%20Stewart">Patrick Stewart</a> was considered for the role of <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>, before the script was rewritten to accommodate <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>'s casting. Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be "big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier". Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role. His <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">prosthetic makeup</a> and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day. Thurman took the role of <a href="Poison%20Ivy%20%28comics%29">Poison Ivy</a> because she liked the <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> characterization of the character. <a href="Alicia%20Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a> was the only choice for the role of <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>. 

According to Schumacher, during the scene in which the costumes of the <a href="Riddler">Riddler</a> and <a href="Two-Face">Two-Face</a> are seen, he originally planned to put Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze escaping from <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a> while many other villains saw them from their cells. The scene, however, didn't make it in the final film.

The original start date was August 1996, but <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> did not begin until September 12, 1996. "Batman & Robin" finished filming in late January 1997, two weeks ahead of the <a href="shooting%20schedule">shooting schedule</a>. The film was mostly shot at Warner Bros. Studios in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>.

When comparing work on "Batman Forever", <a href="Chris%20O%27Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a>, who portrayed Robin, explained, "It just felt like everything got a little soft the second time. On "Batman Forever", I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable than the one he wore in "Batman Forever", with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to <a href="John%20Glover%20%28actor%29">John Glover</a>, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, "Joel [Schumacher] would sit on a crane with a <a href="megaphone">megaphone</a> and yell before each <a href="take%23Film">take</a>, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of set the tone for the film." <a href="Production%20designer">Production designer</a> Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> design came from "<a href="Neon%20sign">neon-ridden</a> Tokyo and the <a href="Machine%20Age">Machine Age</a>. Gotham is like a <a href="World%27s%20fair">World's Fair</a> on <a href="MDMA">ecstasy</a>." <a href="Rhythm%20and%20Hues%20Studios">Rhythm and Hues</a> and <a href="Pacific%20Data%20Images">Pacific Data Images</a> created the visual effects sequences, with <a href="John%20Dykstra">John Dykstra</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Adamson">Andrew Adamson</a> credited as the <a href="visual%20effects%20supervisor">visual effects supervisor</a>s.

According to "Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6: Batman Unbound", Chris O'Donnell revealed that despite hanging out with Arnold Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together. This was achieved with stand ins when one of the actors wasn't available.

Stunt coordinator Alex Field taught <a href="Alicia%20Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a> to ride a motorcycle so that she could play Batgirl.

Like "Batman Forever", the original score for the film was written by <a href="Elliot%20Goldenthal">Elliot Goldenthal</a>. The soundtrack featured a variety of genres by various bands and performers, showcasing <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> on the lead single "<a href="The%20End%20Is%20the%20Beginning%20Is%20the%20End">The End Is the Beginning Is the End</a>" by <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>, on the <a href="Goo%20Goo%20Dolls">Goo Goo Dolls</a>' contribution, "<a href="Lazy%20Eye%20%28Goo%20Goo%20Dolls%20song%29">Lazy Eye</a>" and with <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>'s song "Revolution". R&B singer <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a> also wrote "<a href="Gotham%20City%20%28song%29">Gotham City</a>" for the soundtrack, which became the other song featured in the end credits, as well as one of the singles, reaching the top 10 in the United States and in the UK. <a href="Eric%20Ben%C3%A9t">Eric Benét</a> and <a href="Meshell%20Ndegeocello">Meshell Ndegeocello</a> also contributed R&B songs. Also included was the top 5 second single, "<a href="Look%20into%20My%20Eyes%20%28Bone%20Thugs-n-Harmony%20song%29">Look into My Eyes</a>" by the <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a> group <a href="Bone%20Thugs-n-Harmony">Bone Thugs-n-Harmony</a>. Other songs featured included <a href="Electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance</a> elements, including those by <a href="Moloko">Moloko</a> and <a href="Keny%20Arkana">Arkana</a>. The soundtrack was released on May 27, 1997, a month before the film.

The "Batman & Robin" <a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">film trailer</a> debuted on the February 19, 1997 episode of "<a href="Entertainment%20Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a>". <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> spent $15 million to market and promote the film, in addition to its $125 million production budget. The studio also brought in toy companies to be involved with <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>, including the design of <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> and character illustrations. Director Joel Schumacher criticized Warner Bros.'s strategy for "Batman & Robin" as being overtly <a href="toyetic">toyetic</a>. 

Various <a href="Six%20Flags">Six Flags</a> parks (<a href="Six%20Flags%20Great%20Adventure">Six Flags Great Adventure</a>, <a href="Six%20Flags%20Over%20Texas">Six Flags Over Texas</a>, and <a href="Six%20Flags%20St.%20Louis">Six Flags St. Louis</a>) all debuted coasters themed to the film (all of which have since been closed or re-themed to ""). <a href="Taco%20Bell">Taco Bell</a> featured a promotional campaign including collectible cups and a contest with a replica of the film's <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> as a grand prize. A junior novelization of the screenplay, written by <a href="Alan%20Grant%20%28writer%29">Alan Grant</a>, was published along with the release of the film in 1997.

"Batman & Robin" was released on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend, making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997. The film declined by 63% in its second week. "Batman & Robin" faced early competition with "<a href="Face/Off">Face/Off</a>" and "<a href="Hercules%20%281997%20film%29">Hercules</a>". Schumacher blamed it on <a href="yellow%20journalism">yellow journalism</a> started by <a href="Harry%20Knowles">Harry Knowles</a> of <a href="Ain%27t%20It%20Cool%20News">Ain't It Cool News</a> and other film websites such as <a href="Dark%20Horizons">Dark Horizons</a>. The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million. Warner Bros. acknowledged "Batman & Robin"s shortcomings in the domestic market but pointed out success overseas.

The <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported an approval rating of 10% based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 3.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in "Batman & Robin", resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film has an average score of 28 out of 100, based on 21 critics, signifying "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of "Batman & Robin" on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. "There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make "Batman & Robin" more <a href="family-friendliness">family-friendly</a>," Schumacher explained. "We decided to do a less depressing "Batman" movie and less torture and more heroic. I know I have been criticized a lot for this, but I didn't see the harm in that approach at all." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" criticized the <a href="toyetic">toyetic</a> approach and Mr. Freeze's <a href="One-line%20joke">one-liner jokes</a> in his two-star review of the film. <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" believed the film "killed" the <a href="Batman%20in%20film">"Batman" film series</a>, and felt "Batman & Robin" depended too much on visual effects. <a href="Desson%20Thomson">Desson Thomson</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" largely disapproved of Schumacher's direction and Akiva Goldsman's script. <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a>, writing in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", said, "George Clooney is the big zero of the film, and should go down in history as the <a href="George%20Lazenby">George Lazenby</a> of the series." However, <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" gave a positive review. She praised Uma Thurman's acting, as well as the production and costume design.

"Batman & Robin" was nominated for the <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Fantasy%20Film">Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film</a>, as well as <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Make-up">Best Make-up</a> and <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Costume">Best Costume</a>, but won none. <a href="Alicia%20Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a> won the <a href="Golden%20Raspberry%20Award">Razzie Award</a> for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), as well as <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> (Worst Song for "<a href="The%20End%20Is%20the%20Beginning%20Is%20the%20End">The End Is the Beginning Is the End</a>"). "Batman & Robin" also received nominations for <a href="Golden%20Raspberry%20Award%20for%20Worst%20Picture">Worst Picture</a>, Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, "Batman & Robin" garnered only one Razzie Award.

Some observers thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible <a href="homoeroticism">homoerotic</a> <a href="innuendo">innuendo</a> in the storyline. <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> questioned the "random amount "[sic]" of rubber nipples and camera angle <a href="close-up">close-up</a>s of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." Similar to "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>", this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged <a href="codpiece">codpiece</a>s to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, "I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20art">ancient Greek statue</a>s, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a> joked, "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another "Batman" film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, "I think we might have killed the franchise", and called it "a waste of money".

During the filming of "Batman & Robin", <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> was impressed with the <a href="dailies">dailies</a>, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a fifth film. However, writer <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a> turned down an offer to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired <a href="Mark%20Protosevich">Mark Protosevich</a> to write the script for a fifth "Batman" film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. Titled "Batman Unchained", Protosevich's script had the <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Scarecrow</a> as the main villain. Through the use of his fear <a href="toxin">toxin</a>, he resurrects the <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">Joker</a> as a hallucination in Batman's mind. <a href="Harley%20Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter. George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. It was also hoped that Jack Nicholson would reprise the role of the Joker. However, following the poor critical reception of "Batman & Robin", Clooney vowed never to reprise his role.

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action "<a href="Batman%20Beyond">Batman Beyond</a>" film and an adaptation of <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s "". Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most. Schumacher felt he "owe[d] the Batman culture a real "Batman" movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight." He approached Warner Bros. about doing "Batman: Year One" in mid-1998, but they were more interested in hiring <a href="Darren%20Aronofsky">Darren Aronofsky</a>. Aronofsky and Miller developed a "Year One" script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> was eventually hired to helm the next "Batman" film in January 2003, resulting in the <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a>ed "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" (2005).

In "<a href="Chemistry%20%28The%20New%20Batman%20Adventures%29">Legends of the Dark Knight</a>", an episode of "<a href="The%20New%20Batman%20Adventures">The New Batman Adventures</a>", three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's "Batman and Robin". The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. In "<a href="Watchmen%20%28film%29">Watchmen</a>", director <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a> and comic book artist <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple <a href="Batsuit">Batsuit</a> design from "Batman & Robin" for the <a href="Ozymandias%20%28comics%29">Ozymandias</a> costume. The film is referenced in the "" episode "Legends of the Dark Mite!", when <a href="Bat-Mite">Bat-Mite</a> briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher "Batman" films, before declaring it "Too icky". The Batman from "Batman & Robin" later appeared as part of an army of Batmen gathered from across the <a href="Multiverse%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Multiverse</a> in "Night of the Batmen!", complete with the blue rubber Batsuit. Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to "Batman & Robin" and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film "", which was originally planned for release at around the same time as "Batman & Robin" but was subsequently delayed. However, "SubZero" received a far stronger positive response from critics than "Batman & Robin", with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a "Batman" villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of "".

Batman Forever

Batman Forever is a 1995 American <a href="superhero%20film">superhero film</a> directed by <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> and produced by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> character <a href="Batman">Batman</a>. It is the third installment of the , with <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> replacing <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> as Bruce Wayne / Batman.

"Batman Forever"s tone is significantly different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> believed that the previous "Batman" film, "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>" (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the <a href="Dick%20Sprang">Dick Sprang</a> era, as well as the <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">1960s television series</a>. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. <a href="William%20Baldwin">William Baldwin</a> and <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a> were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.

Edward Nygma, a researcher at <a href="Wayne%20Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a> who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device and set up a meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting his invention and begins to send him <a href="riddle">riddle</a>s (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a suicide note, which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.

At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they are one and the same. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to have a normal life with Chase and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler destroys the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a>. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce and the Riddler leaves him an another riddle.

Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred</a>, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is imprisoned by The Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a>, after realising that the Caped Crusader could use a hand. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but realizing that he does not have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a> and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that "he" himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.


"<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>" was released in 1992 with financial success and generally favorable reviews from critics, but Warner Bros. was disappointed with its box office run, having made $150 million less than the first film. Director Tim Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer, with approval of <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> as director and the husband and wife screenwriting couple Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler, who agreed with him that "the key element to Batman is his duality. And it's not just that Batman is Bruce Wayne". Their original script introduced a psychotic Riddler with a pet rat accompanying him. The story elements and much of the dialogue still remained in the finished film, though Schumacher felt it could be "lighte[ne]d down". Schumacher claims he originally had in mind an adaptation of <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s "". Warner Bros. rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a <a href="prequel">prequel</a>, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Bruce Wayne's childhood with some events of the comic "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>". <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a>, who worked with Schumacher on "<a href="The%20Client%20%281994%20film%29">The Client</a>", was brought in to rewrite the script. Burton, who was more interested in directing "<a href="Ed%20Wood%20%28film%29">Ed Wood</a>", later reflected he was taken aback by some of the <a href="focus%20group">focus group</a> meetings for "Batman Forever", a title which he hated. Producer <a href="Peter%20MacGregor-Scott">Peter MacGregor-Scott</a> represented the studio's aim in making a film for the MTV Generation with full merchandising appeal.

Production went on fast track with <a href="Rene%20Russo">Rene Russo</a> cast as <a href="Dr.%20Chase%20Meridian">Dr. Chase Meridian</a> but <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> decided not to reprise Batman because he did not like the new direction the film series was heading in. Keaton also wanted to pursue "more interesting roles", turning down $15 million. A decision was made to go with a younger actor for Bruce Wayne, and an offer was made to <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>, who turned it down. Schumacher had seen <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> in "<a href="Tombstone%20%28film%29">Tombstone</a>", but was also interested in <a href="Daniel%20Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a>, <a href="William%20Baldwin">William Baldwin</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>. Kilmer signed on without reading the script or knowing who the new director was.

With Kilmer's casting, Warner Bros. dropped Rene Russo as Chase Meridian. <a href="Robin%20Wright">Robin Wright</a>, <a href="Jeanne%20Tripplehorn">Jeanne Tripplehorn</a> and <a href="Linda%20Hamilton">Linda Hamilton</a> were all being considered the role was recast with <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a>. <a href="Billy%20Dee%20Williams">Billy Dee Williams</a> took on the role of Harvey Dent in "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>" on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast <a href="Tommy%20Lee%20Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a> in the role, after having worked with him on "The Client". Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> was cast. <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a> appeared in the <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a> of "Batman Returns" but was deleted due to too many characters. <a href="Marlon%20Wayans">Marlon Wayans</a> had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. <a href="Chris%20O%27Donnell">Chris O'Donnell</a> was cast and <a href="Mitchell%20Gaylord">Mitchell Gaylord</a> served as his <a href="stunt%20double">stunt double</a>. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for <a href="Bono">Bono</a> as his MacPhisto character, but both came to agree it was not suitable for the film.

Filming started in September 1994. Schumacher hired Barbara Ling for production design, claiming that the film needed a "force" and good design. Ling could "advance on it". Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be in any way connected to the previous films, and instead was to be inspired by the images from the "Batman" comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of New York City architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern Tokyo. He also wanted a "city with personality", with more statues, as well as various amounts of <a href="neon">neon</a>.

Schumacher had problems filming with Kilmer, whom he described as "childish and impossible", reporting that he fought with various crewmen, and refused to speak to Schumacher during two weeks after the director told him to stop behaving in a rude way. Schumacher also mentioned Tommy Lee Jones as a source of trouble: "Jim Carrey was a gentleman, and Tommy Lee was threatened by him. I'm tired of defending overpaid, overprivileged actors. I pray I don't work with them again." Carrey later acknowledged Jones was not friendly to him, telling him once off-set during the production, "I hate you. I really don't like you ... I cannot sanction your buffoonery."

<a href="Rick%20Baker%20%28makeup%20artist%29">Rick Baker</a> designed the <a href="prosthetic%20makeup">prosthetic makeup</a>. <a href="John%20Dykstra">John Dykstra</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Adamson">Andrew Adamson</a> and <a href="Jim%20Rygiel">Jim Rygiel</a> served as <a href="visual%20effects%20supervisor">visual effects supervisor</a>s, with <a href="Pacific%20Data%20Images">Pacific Data Images</a> also contributing to visual effects work. PDI provided a computer-generated Batman for complicated stunts. For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman's costume was redesigned along the lines of a more "MTV organic, and edgier feel" to the suit. Sound editing and mixing was supervised by <a href="Bruce%20Stambler">Bruce Stambler</a> and John Levesque, which included trips to caves to record bat sounds. A new <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> was designed for "Batman Forever", with two cars being constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close-ups. Swiss surrealist painter <a href="H.R.%20Giger">H.R. Giger</a> provided his version for the Batmobile but it was considered too sinister for the film.

<a href="Elliot%20Goldenthal">Elliot Goldenthal</a> was hired by Schumacher to compose the film score before the screenplay was written. In discussions with Schumacher, the director wanted Goldenthal to avoid taking inspiration from <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>, and requested an original composition. The film's promotional teaser trailer used the main title theme from Elfman's score of 1989's "<a href="Batman%201989">Batman</a>".

The soundtrack was commercially successful, selling almost as many copies as <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>'s <a href="Batman%20%28album%29">soundtrack</a> to the 1989 "Batman" film. Only five of the songs on the soundtrack are actually featured in the movie. Hit singles from the soundtrack include "<a href="Hold%20Me%2C%20Thrill%20Me%2C%20Kiss%20Me%2C%20Kill%20Me">Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me</a>" by <a href="U2">U2</a> and "<a href="Kiss%20from%20a%20Rose">Kiss from a Rose</a>" by <a href="Seal%20%28musician%29">Seal</a>, both of which were nominated for MTV Movie Awards. "Kiss from a Rose" (whose video was also directed by Joel Schumacher) reached No. 1 in the U.S. charts as well. The soundtrack itself, featuring additional songs by <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>, <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy</a> (both songs also included in the film), <a href="Method%20Man">Method Man</a>, <a href="Nick%20Cave">Nick Cave</a>, <a href="Michael%20Hutchence">Michael Hutchence</a> (of INXS), <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a>, and <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a>, was an attempt to (in producer Peter MacGregor-Scott's words) make the film more "pop".

"Batman Forever" went through a few major edits before its release. Originally darker than the final product, the movie's original length was closer to 2 hours and 40 minutes according to director Joel Schumacher. There was talk of an extended cut being released to DVD for the film's 10th anniversary in 2005. While all four previous "Batman" films were given special edition DVD releases on the same day as the "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" DVD release, none of them were given extended cuts, although some of the following scenes were in a deleted scenes section in the special features.

There was an undercurrent theme involving Bruce having repressed memories of an aspect of his parents' death that he hadn't faced which was finding his father's diary on the night of his parents' wake and reading that Bruce insisted his parents go to the theater so he could watch one of the shows, meaning the reason he became Batman was out of the guilt that he killed them.

Many scenes were filmed but deleted from the film, other scenes had footage removed. These included:


"Batman Forever" opened in 2,842 theaters in the United States on June 16, 1995, making $52.8 million in its opening weekend, breaking "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>"'s record for highest opening weekend gross of all-time (it was surpassed two years later by ""s $72.1 million). The film went on to gross $184 million in North America, and $152.5 million in other countries, totaling $336.53 million. The film earned more money than its predecessor "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>", and was the second-highest (behind "<a href="Toy%20Story">Toy Story</a>") grossing film of 1995, in the U.S.

On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has an approval rating of 40% based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Loud, excessively busy, and often boring, "Batman Forever" nonetheless has the charisma of Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones to offer mild relief." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.

<a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> said ""Batman Forever" still gets in its licks. There's no fun machine this summer that packs more surprises." However, he criticized the film's excessive commercialism and felt that "the script misses the pain <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> caught in a man tormented by the long-ago murder of his parents" seeing the Bruce Wayne of Kilmer as "inexpressive". Brian Lowry of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" believed "One does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber <a href="batsuit">batsuit</a>. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred</a>'s? Some of the computer-generated <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham</a> cityscapes appear too obviously fake. <a href="Elliot%20Goldenthal">Elliot Goldenthal</a>'s score, while serviceable, also isn't as stirring as <a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>'s work in the first two films."

<a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> enjoyed the film. "It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and a whole lot more colorful than before." <a href="Scott%20Beatty">Scott Beatty</a> felt "Tommy Lee Jones played <a href="Two-Face">Harvey Dent</a> as a <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">Joker</a> knock-off rather than a multi-layered rogue." <a href="Lee%20Bermejo">Lee Bermejo</a> called "Batman Forever" "unbearable". <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a <a href="thumbs%20signal">thumbs up</a> and the latter a <a href="thumbs%20signal">thumbs down</a>. In his written review, Ebert wrote: "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great <a href="bubblegum">bubblegum</a> for the eyes. Younger children will be able to process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from "Batman Returns" where the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">PG-13 rating</a> was a joke." <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> had a mixed reaction, concluding "a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience."

At the <a href="68th%20Academy%20Awards">68th Academy Awards</a>, "Batman Forever" was nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Cinematography</a> (lost to "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>"), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound%20Mixing">Sound Mixing</a> (<a href="Donald%20O.%20Mitchell">Donald O.

Batman: Year One

"Year One" later referred to as "Batman: Year One" is an <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a> <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> published by <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>, and recounts superhero <a href="Batman">Batman</a>'s first year as a crime-fighter. It was written by <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>, illustrated by <a href="David%20Mazzucchelli">David Mazzucchelli</a>, colored by <a href="Richmond%20Lewis">Richmond Lewis</a>, and lettered by <a href="Todd%20Klein">Todd Klein</a>. "Batman: Year One" originally appeared in issues #404–407 of the comic book title "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" in 1987. As well as recounting <a href="Batman">Batman</a>'s early crime fighting career, the story simultaneously examines the life of recently transferred officer <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James Gordon</a> - eventually building towards their partnership.

There have been several reprints of the story: a <a href="hardcover">hardcover</a>, multiple <a href="Trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a> editions (one in standard comics paper with simpler coloring and one deluxe version with rich detailing in the colors — both colored by <a href="Richmond%20Lewis">Richmond Lewis</a>) and it has been included in "The Complete Frank Miller Batman" hardcover. The <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> was adapted into an in 2011.

The story recounts the beginning of Bruce Wayne's career as <a href="Batman">Batman</a> and <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">Jim Gordon</a>'s with the <a href="Gotham%20City%20Police%20Department">Gotham City Police Department</a>. Bruce Wayne returns home to <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> at the age of twenty-five from training abroad in martial arts, man-hunting, and science for the past 12 years, and James Gordon moves to Gotham City with his wife, Barbara, after a transfer from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Both are swiftly acquainted with the corruption and violence of Gotham City, with Gordon witnessing his partner <a href="Arnold%20John%20Flass">Detective Arnold John Flass</a> assaulting an African-American teen for fun.

After refusing a proposition from a teenage prostitute <a href="Holly%20Robinson%20%28fictional%20character%29">Holly Robinson</a>, Bruce is reluctantly drawn into a brawl with her violent pimp and is attacked by several prostitutes, including <a href="dominatrix">dominatrix</a> <a href="Catwoman">Selina Kyle</a>. Two police officers shoot and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Bruce breaks his handcuffs and causes a crash, dragging the police to a safe distance before fleeing. He reaches <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a> barely alive and sits before his father’s bust, requesting guidance in his war on crime. A bat crashes through a window and settles on the bust, giving him the inspiration to become a bat.

Gordon soon works to rid corruption from the force, but, on orders from <a href="Gillian%20B.%20Loeb">Commissioner Gillian Loeb</a>, several officers attack him, including Flass, who personally threatens Gordon’s pregnant wife. In revenge, the recovering Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.

As Gordon becomes a minor celebrity for several brave acts, Batman strikes for the first time, attacking a group of thieves. Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while the latter was accepting a drug dealer’s bribe. After Batman interrupts a dinner party attended by many of Gotham’s corrupt politicians and crime bosses to announce his intention to bring them to justice, including <a href="Carmine%20Falcone">Carmine "The Roman" Falcone</a>, Loeb orders Gordon to bring him in by any means necessary.

As Gordon tries in vain to catch him, Batman attacks Falcone, stripping him naked and tying him up in his bed and dumping his car in the river, infuriating the mob boss. Assistant <a href="District%20Attorney">District Attorney</a> <a href="Two-Face">Harvey Dent</a> becomes Batman’s first ally, while <a href="Sarah%20Essen%20Gordon">Detective Sarah Essen</a> and Gordon witness Batman save an old woman from a runaway truck, after Essen suggested Bruce Wayne as a Batman suspect. Essen holds Batman at gunpoint while Gordon is momentarily dazed, but Batman disarms her and flees to an abandoned building.

Claiming the building has been scheduled for demolition, Loeb orders a bomb to be dropped on it, forcing Batman into the fortified basement, where he abandons his belt as it catches fire. A <a href="SWAT">SWAT</a> team led by trigger-happy officer Branden is sent in and attempts to trap Batman in the basement. After tranquilizing Branden, Batman dodges bullets as Branden's team opens fire on him, barely managing to survive after two bullet wounds. Enraged as the team’s carelessly fired bullets injure several people outside, Batman beats the team into submission and, after using a device to attract the bats of his cave to him, he flees amid the chaos. After witnessing him in action, Selina Kyle dons a costume of her own to begin a life of crime.

Gordon has a brief affair with Essen, while Batman intimidates a mob drug dealer for information. The dealer comes to Gordon to testify against Flass, who is brought up on charges. Upset with Gordon's exploits, Loeb blackmails Gordon against pressing charges with proof of his affair. After bringing Barbara with him to interview Bruce Wayne, investigating his connection to Batman, Gordon confesses the affair to her.

Batman sneaks into Falcone’s manor, overhearing a plan against Gordon, but is interrupted when Selina Kyle, hoping to build a reputation after her robberies were pinned on Batman, attacks Falcone and his bodyguards, aided from afar by Batman. Identifying Falcone’s plan as the morning comes, the uncostumed Bruce leaves to help.

While leaving home, Gordon spots a motorcyclist enter his garage. Suspicious, Gordon enters to see Johnny Vitti, Falcone’s nephew, and his thugs holding his family hostage. Gordon decisively shoots the thugs and chases Vitti, who has fled with the baby. The mysterious motorcyclist, now revealed to the reader as Bruce Wayne, rushes out to chase Vitti. Gordon blows out Vitti's car tire on a bridge and the two fight hand-to-hand, with Gordon losing his glasses, before Vitti and James Gordon, Jr. fall over the side. Bruce leaps over the railing and saves the baby. Gordon realizes that he is standing before an unmasked Batman, but says that he is "practically blind without [his] glasses," and lets Bruce go.

In the final scenes of the comic, Flass turns on Loeb, supplying Dent with evidence and testimony, and Loeb resigns. Gordon is promoted to captain and stands on the rooftop waiting to meet Batman to discuss somebody called <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">the Joker</a>, who is plotting to poison the reservoir.

"Batman: Year One" has received widespread critical acclaim. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> Comics ranked "Batman: Year One" number 2 on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels (behind ""<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>"", also by Miller) and said that "no other book before or since has quite captured the realism, the grit and the humanity of Gordon and Batman so perfectly." The website added, "It's not only one of the most important comics ever written, it's also among the best."

Writer Matthew K. Manning in the "1980s" chapter of "DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle" (2010) praises the story for both Miller's "realistic characterization" and Mazzucchelli's "brilliant iconic" artwork.

Before <a href="the%20New%2052">the New 52</a> "Batman: Year One" existed in the mainstream DC continuity, and in the same continuity as the other storylines in Miller's "Dark Knight Universe", consisting of "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>", its sequel "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Strikes%20Again">The Dark Knight Strikes Again</a>", "", "The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade", "<a href="Spawn/Batman">Spawn/Batman</a>", and "<a href="All%20Star%20Batman%20and%20Robin%20the%20Boy%20Wonder">All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder</a>". However, following the New 52 reboot, "" replaced "Year One" as the official origin for Batman and "Year One" was relegated to the continuity of the <a href="Batman%20%28Dark%20Knight%20Universe%29">other Frank Miller storylines</a>.

Following "<a href="Crisis%20on%20Infinite%20Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>", DC <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">rebooted</a> many of its titles. "Year One" was followed by "", but the 1994 "" crossover erased "Year Two" from continuity. In another continuity re-arrangement, "Catwoman: Year One" ("Catwoman Annual" #2, 1995) posited that Selina Kyle had not actually been a prostitute, but, rather, a thief posing as one in order to commit crimes.

Launched in 1989, following the success of the film "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>", the title "" examines crime-fighting exploits primarily, not exclusively, from the first four to five years of Batman's career. This title rotated in creative teams and time placement, but several stories directly relate to the events of "Year One", especially the first arc "Batman: Shaman".

The "Year One" story was continued in the 2005 graphic novel "", following up on Gordon informing Batman about the Joker, and thus recounting their first official encounter.

<doc id="4733" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4733" title="Bi-directional text">
Bi-directional text

Bi-directional text is text containing text in both <a href="Writing%20system%23Directionality">text directionalities</a>, both <a href="right-to-left">right-to-left</a> (RTL or dextrosinistral) and <a href="left-to-right">left-to-right</a> (LTR or sinistrodextral). It generally involves text containing different types of <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>s, but may also refer to <a href="boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>, which is changing text directionality in each row.

Some <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>s of the world, including the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a> and <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> scripts or derived systems such as the <a href="Persian%20alphabet">Persian</a>, <a href="Urdu%20alphabet">Urdu</a>, and <a href="Yiddish%20orthography">Yiddish</a> scripts, are written in a form known as right-to-left (RTL), in which writing begins at the right-hand side of a page and concludes at the left-hand side. This is different from the left-to-right (LTR) direction used by most writing systems in the world. When LTR text is mixed with RTL in the same paragraph, each type of text is written in its own direction, which is known as "bi-directional text". This can get rather complex when multiple levels of quotation are used.

Many computer programs fail to display bi-directional text correctly.
For example, the Hebrew name Sarah (שרה) is spelled: sin (ש) (which appears rightmost), then resh (ר), and finally heh (ה) (which should appear leftmost).

"Note: Some <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a>s may display the Hebrew text in this article in the opposite direction."

Bidirectional script support is the capability of a <a href="computer">computer</a> system to correctly display bi-directional text. The term is often shortened to "BiDi" or "bidi".

Early computer installations were designed only to support a single <a href="writing%20system">writing system</a>, typically for left-to-right scripts based on the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a> only. Adding new <a href="character%20set">character set</a>s and <a href="character%20encoding">character encoding</a>s enabled a number of other left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a> or <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a>, and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like <a href="ISO/IEC%208859-6">ISO/IEC 8859-6</a> and <a href="ISO/IEC%208859-8">ISO/IEC 8859-8</a>, storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply flip the left-to-right display order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.

In particular, the <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> standard provides foundations for complete BiDi support, with detailed rules as to how mixtures of left-to-right and right-to-left scripts are to be encoded and displayed.

The Unicode standard calls for characters to be ordered 'logically', i.e. in the sequence they are intended to be interpreted, as opposed to 'visually', the sequence they appear. This distinction is relevant for bidi support because at any bidi transition, the visual presentation ceases to be the 'logical' one. Thus, in order to offer bidi support, Unicode prescribes an algorithm for how to convert the logical sequence of characters into the correct visual presentation. For this purpose, the Unicode encoding standard divides all its characters into one of four types: 'strong', 'weak', 'neutral', and 'explicit formatting'.

Strong characters are those with definite directionality. Examples of this type of character include most alphabetic characters, syllabic characters, Han ideographs, non-European or non-Arabic digits, and punctuation characters "that are specific to only those scripts".

Weak characters are those with vague directionality. Examples of this type of character include European digits, Eastern Arabic-Indic digits, arithmetic symbols, and currency symbols. Punctuation symbols that are common to many scripts, such as the colon, comma, full-stop, and the no-break-space also fall within this category.

 Unless a directional override is present numbers are always encoded (and entered) big-endian, and the numerals rendered LTR. The weak directionality only applies to the placement of the number in its entirety.

Neutral characters have directionality indeterminable without context. Examples include paragraph separators, tabs, and most other whitespace characters.

Explicit formatting characters, also referred to as "directional formatting characters", are special Unicode sequences that direct the unicode algorithm to modify its default behavior. These characters are subdivided into "marks", "embeddings", "isolates", and "overrides". Their effects continue until the occurrence of either a paragraph separator, or a "pop" character.

If a "weak" character is followed by another "weak" character, the algorithm will look at the first neighbouring "strong" character. Sometimes this leads to unintentional display errors. These errors are corrected or prevented with "pseudo-strong" characters. Such <a href="Unicode%20control%20characters">Unicode control characters</a> are called "marks". The mark ( or ) is to be inserted into a location to make an enclosed weak character inherit its writing direction.

For example, to correctly display the for an English name brand (LTR) in an Arabic (RTL) passage, an LRM mark is inserted after the trademark symbol if the symbol is not followed by LTR text. If the LRM mark is not added, the weak character ™ will be neighbored by a strong LTR character and a strong RTL character. Hence, in an RTL context, it will be considered to be RTL, and displayed in an incorrect order.

The "embedding" directional formatting characters are the classical Unicode method of explicit formatting, and as of Unicode 6.3, are being discouraged in favor of "isolates". An "embedding" signals that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally distinct. The text within the scope of the embedding formatting characters is not independent of the surrounding text. Also, characters within an embedding can affect the ordering of characters outside. Unicode 6.3 recognized that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use.

The "isolate" directional formatting characters signal that a piece of text is to be treated as directionally isolated from its surroundings. As of Unicode 6.3, these are the formatting characters that are being encouraged in new documents – once target platforms are known to support them. These formatting characters were introduced after it became apparent that directional embeddings usually have too strong an effect on their surroundings and are thus unnecessarily difficult to use. Unlike the legacy 'embedding' directional formatting characters, 'isolate' characters have no effect on the ordering of the text outside their scope. Isolates can be nested, and may be placed within embeddings and overrides.

The "override" directional formatting characters allow for special cases, such as for part numbers (e.g. to force a part number made of mixed English, digits and Hebrew letters to be written from right to left), and are recommended to be avoided wherever possible. As is true of the other directional formatting characters, "overrides" can be nested one inside another, and in embeddings and isolates.

The "pop" directional formatting characters terminate the scope of the most recent "embedding", "override", or "isolate".

In the algorithm, each sequence of concatenated strong characters is called a "run". A "weak" character that is located between two "strong" characters with the same orientation will inherit their orientation. A "weak" character that is located between two "strong" characters with a different writing direction, will inherit the main context's writing direction (in an LTR document the character will become LTR, in an RTL document, it will become RTL).

<a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyph">hieroglyphs</a> can be written bi-directionally, where the signs had a distinct "head" that faced the beginning of a line and "tail" that faced the end.

<a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a> can be written in either direction as well as vertically (top to bottom then right to left), especially in signs (such as plaques), but the orientation of the individual characters is never changed. This can often be seen on tour buses in China, where the company name customarily runs from the front of the vehicle to its rear — that is, from right to left on the right side of the bus, and from left to right on the left side of the bus. English texts on the right side of the vehicle are also quite commonly written in reverse order. (See pictures of tour bus and post vehicle below.)

Likewise, other <a href="CJK">CJK</a> scripts made up of the same square characters, such as the <a href="Japanese%20writing%20system">Japanese writing system</a> and <a href="Korean%20writing%20system">Korean writing system</a>, can also be written in any direction, although left-to-right, top-to-bottom and top-to-bottom, right-to-left are most common.
<a href="Boustrophedon">Boustrophedon</a> is a writing style found in ancient <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> inscriptions and in <a href="Hungarian%20runes">Hungarian runes</a>. This method of writing alternates direction, and usually reverses the individual characters, on each successive line.

<doc id="4734" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4734" title="Bernoulli's inequality">
Bernoulli's inequality

In <a href="real%20analysis">real analysis</a>, Bernoulli's inequality (named after <a href="Jacob%20Bernoulli">Jacob Bernoulli</a>) is an <a href="inequality%20%28mathematics%29">inequality</a> that approximates <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a>s of 1 + "x".

The inequality states that

for every <a href="integer">integer</a> "r" ≥ 0 and every <a href="real%20number">real number</a> "x" ≥ −1. 
If the exponent "r" is <a href="even%20number">even</a>, then the inequality is valid for "all" real numbers "x". The strict version of the inequality reads

for every integer "r" ≥ 2 and every real number "x" ≥ −1 with "x" ≠ 0.

There is also a generalized version that says for every real number r ≥ 1 and real number x ≥ -1,

while for 0 ≤ "r" ≤ 1 and real number x ≥ -1,

Bernoulli's inequality is often used as the crucial step in the <a href="proof%20%28math%29">proof</a> of other inequalities. It can itself be proved using <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a>, as shown below.

Jacob Bernoulli first published the inequality in his treatise “Positiones Arithmeticae de Seriebus Infinitis” (Basel, 1689), where he used the inequality often.

According to Joseph E. Hofmann, Über die Exercitatio Geometrica des M. A. Ricci (1963), p. 177, the inequality is actually due to Sluse in his Mesolabum (1668 edition), Chapter IV "De maximis & minimis".

For "r" = 0,

is equivalent to 1 ≥ 1 which is true as required.

Now suppose the statement is true for "r" = "k":

Then it follows that

By induction we conclude the statement is true for all "r" ≥ 0.

The exponent "r" can be generalized to an arbitrary real number as follows: if "x" > −1, then

for "r" ≤ 0 or "r" ≥ 1, and

for 0 ≤ "r" ≤ 1.

This generalization can be proved by comparing <a href="derivative">derivative</a>s.
Again, the strict versions of these inequalities require "x" ≠ 0 and "r" ≠ 0, 1.

The following inequality estimates the "r"-th power of 1 + "x" from the other side. For any real numbers "x", "r" > 0, one has

where "e" = <a href="e%20%28number%29">2.718...</a>. This may be proved using the inequality (1 + 1/"k") < "e".

An alternative form of Bernoulli's inequality for formula_11 and formula_12 is:

This can be proved (for integer t) by using the formula for <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a>: (using y=1-x)

or equivalently formula_15

Using AM-GM 

An elementary proof for formula_16 can be given using <a href="Inequality%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20geometric%20means">Weighted AM-GM</a>. 

Let formula_17 be two non-negative real constants. By Weighted AM-GM on formula_18 with weights formula_17 respectively, we get

formula_20

Note that 

formula_21

and

formula_22

so our inequality is equivalent to

formula_23

After substituting formula_24 (bearing in mind that this implies formula_16) our inequality turns into 

formula_26 which is Bernoulli's inequality.

Using Binomial theorem

(1) For , formula_27
Obviously, formula_28

Thus, formula_29

(2) For , it is obvious that formula_30

(3) For , let , then 

Replace with , we have formula_31

Also, according to the binomial theorem, formula_32

thenformula_33

Notice that formula_34

Therefore, we can see that each binomial term formula_35 is multiplied by a factor formula_36 , and that will make each term smaller than the term before.

For that reason, formula_37

Hence, formula_38

Replace with back, we get formula_29

Notice that by using binomial theorem, we can only prove the cases when r is a positive integer or zero.

The "Benjamin Franklin"-class submarine was a group of <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">US</a> <a href="ballistic%20missile%20submarine">ballistic missile submarine</a>s that were in Navy service from the 1960s–2000s. The class was an evolutionary development from the earlier of fleet ballistic missile submarine. Having quieter machinery and other improvements, it is considered a separate class. A subset of this class is the re-engineered 640 class starting with The primary difference was that they were built under the new SUBSAFE rules after the loss of the USS Thresher, earlier boats of the class had to be retrofitted to meet SUBSAFE requirements. The "Benjamin Franklin" class, together with the , , , and classes, composed the "<a href="41%20for%20Freedom">41 for Freedom</a>" that was the Navy's primary contribution to the <a href="nuclear%20deterrent">nuclear deterrent</a> force through the late 1980s. This class and the "James Madison" class are combined with the "Lafayette"s in some references.

The "Benjamin Franklin"-class submarines were built with the <a href="Polaris%20missile">Polaris A-3</a> <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>, and in the early 1970s were converted to carry the <a href="Poseidon%20missile">Poseidon C-3</a> missile. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, six boats were further modified to carry the <a href="Trident%20missile">Trident I (C-4)</a> missile, along with six "James Madison"-class boats. These were "Benjamin Franklin", "Simon Bolivar", "George Bancroft", "Henry L. Stimson", "Francis Scott Key", and "Mariano G. Vallejo".

Due to the loss of in April 1963, this class was designed to <a href="SUBSAFE">SUBSAFE</a> standards and its equipment was similar to the fast <a href="attack%20submarine">attack submarine</a>s (SSNs). Previous US SSBNs except the "George Washington" class had equipment similar to the SSNs.

This class can be distinguished by the fairwater planes' location halfway up the sail; the "Lafayette"s and "James Madison"s had the fairwater planes in the upper front portion of the sail.

Two submarines of this class were converted for delivery of up to 66 <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">SEALs</a> or other <a href="Special%20Operations%20Forces">Special Operations Forces</a> each. In the early 1990s, to make room for the ballistic missile submarines within the limits set by the <a href="SALT%20II">SALT II</a> strategic arms limitation treaty, the ballistic missile tubes of and were disabled. Those boats were redesignated <a href="special%20operations">special operations</a> <a href="attack%20submarine">attack submarine</a>s and given attack submarine (SSN) <a href="hull%20classification%20symbols">hull classification symbols</a>. They were equipped with <a href="dry%20deck%20shelter">dry deck shelter</a>s to accommodate <a href="SEAL%20Delivery%20Vehicle">SEAL Delivery Vehicle</a>s or other equipment.

The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in "<a href="Datamation">Datamation</a>." They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in "<a href="Network%20Week">Network Week</a>." Since 2000 they have been published regularly in "<a href="The%20Register">The Register</a>" (UK). Several collections of the stories have been published as books.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays the qualities of the original.

The early accounts of the BOFH took place in a university; later the scenes were set in an office workplace. In 2000 (BOFH 2k), the BOFH and his pimply-faced youth (PFY) assistant moved to a new company.

Brownie McGhee

Walter Brown "Brownie" McGhee (November 30, 1915 – February 16, 1996) was an <a href="African-American">African-American</a> <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> and <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a> singer and guitarist, best known for his collaboration with the harmonica player <a href="Sonny%20Terry">Sonny Terry</a>.

McGhee was born in <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, and grew up in <a href="Kingsport%2C%20Tennessee">Kingsport, Tennessee</a>. At about the age of four he contracted polio, which incapacitated his leg. His brother <a href="Stick%20McGhee">Granville "Sticks"(or "Stick") McGhee</a>, who also later became a musician and composed the famous song "Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-o-Dee," was nicknamed for pushing young Brownie around in a cart. Their father, George McGhee, was a factory worker, known around University Avenue for playing guitar and singing. Brownie's uncle made him a guitar from a tin marshmallow box and a piece of board.

McGhee spent much of his youth immersed in music, singing with a local harmony group, the Golden Voices Gospel Quartet, and teaching himself to play guitar. He also played the five-string banjo and ukulele and studied piano. Surgery funded by the <a href="March%20of%20Dimes">March of Dimes</a> enabled McGhee to walk.

At age 22, McGhee became a traveling musician, working in the <a href="Rabbit%20Foot%20Minstrels">Rabbit Foot Minstrels</a> and befriending <a href="Blind%20Boy%20Fuller">Blind Boy Fuller</a>, whose guitar playing influenced him greatly. After Fuller's death in 1941, <a href="J.%20B.%20Long">J. B. Long</a> of <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> promoted McGhee as "Blind Boy Fuller No. 2." By that time, McGhee was recording for Columbia's subsidiary <a href="Okeh%20Records">Okeh Records</a> in Chicago, but his real success came after he moved to New York in 1942, when he teamed up with <a href="Sonny%20Terry">Sonny Terry</a>, whom he had known since 1939, when Terry was Fuller's harmonica player. The pairing was an overnight success. They recorded and toured together until around 1980. As a duo, Terry and McGhee did most of their work from 1958 until 1980, spending 11 months of each year touring and recording dozens of albums.

Despite their later fame as "pure" folk artists playing for white audiences, in the 1940s Terry and McGhee had attempted to be successful recording artists, fronting a <a href="jump%20blues">jump blues</a> combo with honking saxophone and rolling piano, variously calling themselves Brownie McGhee and his Jook House Rockers or Sonny Terry and his Buckshot Five, often with <a href="Champion%20Jack%20Dupree">Champion Jack Dupree</a> and <a href="Big%20Chief%20Ellis">Big Chief Ellis</a>.

During the <a href="Roots%20revival">blues revival</a> of the 1960s, Terry and McGhee were popular on the concert and music festival circuits, occasionally adding new material but usually remaining faithful to their roots and playing to the tastes of their audiences.

Late in his life, McGhee appeared in small roles in films and on television. He and Terry appeared in the 1979 <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a> comedy "<a href="The%20Jerk">The Jerk</a>". In 1987, McGhee gave a small but memorable performance as the ill-fated blues singer Toots Sweet in the supernatural thriller movie "<a href="Angel%20Heart">Angel Heart</a>." In his review of "Angel Heart", the critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> singled out McGhee for praise, declaring that he delivered a "performance that proves [saxophonist] <a href="Dexter%20Gordon">Dexter Gordon</a> isn't the only old musician who can act." McGhee appeared in the television series "Family Ties", in a 1988 episode entitled "The Blues, Brother", in which he played the fictional blues musician Eddie Dupre. He also appeared in the television series "<a href="Matlock%20%28TV%20series%29">Matlock</a>", in a 1989 episode entitled "The Blues Singer".

<a href="Happy%20Traum">Happy Traum</a>, a former guitar student of McGhee's, edited a blues guitar instruction guide and songbook, "Guitar Styles of Brownie McGhee", published in 1971, in which McGhee, between lessons, talked about his life and the blues.

International Bureau of Weights and Measures

The International Bureau of Weights and Measures () is an intergovernmental organization, one of three such organisations established to maintain the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI) under the terms of the <a href="Metre%20Convention">Metre Convention</a> ("Convention du Mètre"). The organisation is usually referred to by its French <a href="Acronym%20and%20initialism">initialism</a>, BIPM.

The BIPM reports to the <a href="International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (), which is in turn overseen by periodic meetings of the <a href="General%20Conference%20on%20Weights%20and%20Measures">General Conference on Weights and Measures</a> (). These organizations are also commonly referred to by their French initialisms.

The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the <a href="Metre%20Convention">Metre Convention</a>, a <a href="treaty">treaty</a> among 51 nations (). It is based at the <a href="Pavillon%20de%20Breteuil">Pavillon de Breteuil</a> in <a href="S%C3%A8vres">Sèvres</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, a site (originally ) granted to the Bureau by the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">French Government</a> in 1876, where it enjoys <a href="extraterritoriality">extraterritorial</a> status, a status that was clarified by the French decree No 70-820 of 9 September 1970.

Under the authority of the Metric Convention, the BIPM helps to ensure uniformity of SI weights and measures around the world.

Bayonne

Bayonne (; <a href="Gascon%20dialect">Gascon</a>: "Baiona" ; ; ) is a city and <a href="Communes%20of%20France">commune</a> and one of the two <a href="Subprefectures%20in%20France">sub-prefectures</a> of the <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> of <a href="Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pyrénées-Atlantiques</a>, in the <a href="Nouvelle-Aquitaine">Nouvelle-Aquitaine</a> region of south-western France. It is located at the confluence of the <a href="Nive">Nive</a> and <a href="Adour">Adour</a> rivers in the northern part of the <a href="cultural%20region">cultural region</a> of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>, as well as the southern part of <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> where the Aquitaine basin joins the beginning of the <a href="Pre-Pyrenees">Pre-Pyrenees</a>.

Together with nearby <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>, <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a>, and several smaller communes, Bayonne forms an urban area with 288,359 inhabitants at the 2012 census, 45,855 of whom lived in the city of Bayonne proper.

The site on the left bank of the Nive and the Adour was probably occupied before <a href="ancient%20times">ancient times</a> as a fortified enclosure was attested in the 1st century at the time when the <a href="Tarbelli">Tarbelli</a> occupied the territory. Archaeological studies have confirmed the presence of a Roman <a href="Castra">castrum</a>, a stronghold in <a href="Novempopulania">Novempopulania</a> at the end of the 4th century before the city was populated by the <a href="Vascones">Vascones</a>.

In 1023 Bayonne was the capital of <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a> and, in the 12th century, extended to and beyond the Nive. At that time the first bridge was built over the Adour. The city came under the domination of the English in 1152 through the marriage of <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>: it became militarily and, above all, commercially important thanks to maritime trade. It was separated from the Viscount of Labourd in 1177 by <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard the Lion Heart</a>. In 1451 the city was taken by the Crown of France after the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. The loss of trade with the English and the silting up of the river as well as the movement of the city towards the north weakened it. The district of Saint-Esprit developed anyway thanks to the arrival of a Jewish population fleeing the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. From this community Bayonne gained its reputation for chocolate. The course of the Adour was changed in 1578 under the direction of <a href="Louis%20de%20Foix">Louis de Foix</a> and the river returned to its former mouth, returning business lost to Bayonne for over a hundred years. In the 17th century the city was fortified by <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Prestre%20de%20Vauban">Vauban</a>. In 1814 Bayonne and its surroundings were the scene of fighting between the Napoleonic troops and the Spanish-Anglo-Portuguese coalition led by the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a>: the city then underwent its final <a href="Battle%20of%20Bayonne">siege</a>.

In 1951 the Lacq gas field was discovered whose extracted <a href="sulphur">sulphur</a> and associated oil are shipped from the port of Bayonne. During the second half of the 20th century many housing estates were built forming new districts on the periphery and the city was extended to form a conurbation with <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a> and <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>: this agglomeration became the heart of a vast Basque-Landes urban area.

Bayonne was, in 2014, a commune with over 45,000 inhabitants, the heart of the urban area of Bayonne and of the "Agglomeration Côte Basque-Adour" which includes <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a> and <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>. It is an important part of the Basque "Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity" and it plays the role of economic capital of the Adour basin. Modern industry—metallurgy and chemicals—are established to take advantage of procurement opportunities and sea shipments through the harbour. It is now mostly business services which today represent the largest source of employment. Bayonne is also a cultural capital, a city with strong Basque and Gascon influences and a rich historical past. Its heritage lies in its architecture, the diversity of collections in museums, its gastronomic specialties, and traditional events such as the famous <a href="F%C3%AAtes%20de%20Bayonne">Fêtes de Bayonne</a>.

The inhabitants of the commune are known as "Bayonnais" or "Bayonnaises".

Bayonne is located in the south-west of France on the western border between <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> and <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>. It developed at the confluence of the <a href="Adour">Adour</a> and its tributary on the left bank, the <a href="Nive">Nive</a>, 6 km from the Atlantic coast. The commune was part of the Basque province of <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a>.

Bayonne occupies a territory characterized by a flat relief to the west and to the north towards the <a href="Landes%20forest">Landes forest</a>, tending to slightly raise towards the south and east. The city has developed at the confluence of the Adour and Nive from the ocean. The meeting point of the two rivers coincides with a narrowing of the Adour valley. Above this the alluvial plain extends for nearly towards both <a href="Tercis-les-Bains">Tercis-les-Bains</a> and <a href="Peyrehorade">Peyrehorade</a>, and is characterized by swampy meadows called "barthes" which are influenced by floods and high tides. Downstream from this point the river has shaped a large bed in the sand dunes creating a significant bottleneck at the confluence.

The occupation of the hill that dominates this narrowing of the valley developed through a gradual spread across the lowlands by building embankments and the <a href="aggradation">aggradation</a> from flood soil.

The Nive has played a leading role in the development of the Bayonne river system in recent geological time by the formation of alluvial terraces that form the sub-soil of Bayonne beneath the surface accumulations of silt and aeolian sands. The drainage network of the western <a href="Pre-Pyrenees">Pre-Pyrenees</a> evolved mostly from the <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> from south-east to northwest oriented east-west. The Adour was then captured by the gaves and this system, together with the Nive, led to the emergence of a new alignment of the lower Adour and the Adour-Nive confluence. This capture has been dated to the early Quaternary (80,000 years ago).

Before this capture the Nive had deposited pebbles from the <a href="Mindel%20glaciation">Mindel glaciation</a> of medium to large sizes that slowed erosion of the hills causing the bottleneck at Bayonne. After the deposit of the lowest alluvial terrace ( high at Grand Bayonne), the course of the Adour became fixed in its lower reaches.

Subsequent to these deposits there was a rise in sea level in the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> period (from 15,000 to 5000 years ago) which explains the invasion of the lower valleys with fine sand, peat, and mud with a thickness of more than below the current bed of the Adour and the Nive in Bayonne. These same deposits are spread across the barthes.

In the late Quaternary the topographic physiognomy we know today was formed—i.e. a set of hills overlooking a swampy lowland. The promontory of <a href="Bassussarry">Bassussarry</a>–Marracq ultimately extended to the labourdin foothills, dying out at the Grand Bayonne hill is an example. Similarly, on the right bank of the Nive, the heights of Château-Neuf (Mocoron Hill) met the latest advance of the plateau of Saint-Pierre-d'Irube (height ). On the right bank of the Adour the heights of Castelnau (today the citadel) with an altitude of , and Fort (today Saint-Esprit) with an altitude of rise above the Barthes of the Adour, the Nive, Bourgneuf, Saint-Frédéric, Sainte-Croix, Aritxague, and Pontots.

The area of the commune is and its altitude varies between .

The city is traversed by the Adour. The river is part of the <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> network from its source at <a href="Bagn%C3%A8res-de-Bigorre">Bagnères-de-Bigorre</a> to its exit to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> after Bayonne, between <a href="Tarnos">Tarnos</a> (Landes) for the right bank and <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a> (Pyrénées-Atlantiques) for the left bank.

Apart from the <a href="Nive">Nive</a>, which converges on the left bank of the Adour after of a sometimes tumultuous course, two tributaries join the Adour in Bayonne commune: the "Ruisseau de Portou" and the "Ruisseau du Moulin Esbouc". Tributaries of the Nive are the "Ruisseau de Hillans" and the "Ruisseau d'Urdaintz" which both rise in the commune.

The nearest weather station is that of Biarritz-Anglet.

The climate of Bayonne is relatively similar to that of its neighbour Biarritz, described below, with fairly heavy rainfall; The oceanic climate is due to the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean. The average winter temperature is around 8 °C and is around 20 °C in summer. The lowest temperature recorded was −12.7 °C on 16 January 1985 and the highest 40.6 °C on 4 August 2003. Rains on the Basque coast are rarely persistent except during winter storms. They often take the form of intense thunderstorms of short duration.

Bayonne is located at the intersection of the <a href="A63%20autoroute">A63 autoroute</a> (Bordeaux-Spain) and the D1 extension of the <a href="A64%20autoroute">A64 autoroute</a> (towards <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>). The city is served by three interchanges—two of them on the A63: exit (Bayonne Nord) serves the northern districts of Bayonne but also allows quick access to the centre while exit (Bayonne Sud) provides access to the south and also serves <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>. The third exit is the D1 / A64 via the Mousserolles interchange (exit Bayonne Mousserolles) which links the district of the same name and also serves the neighbouring communes of <a href="Mouguerre">Mouguerre</a> and <a href="Saint-Pierre-d%27Irube">Saint-Pierre-d'Irube</a>.

Bayonne was traversed by <a href="Route%20nationale%2010">Route nationale 10</a> connecting <a href="Paris">Paris</a> to <a href="Hendaye">Hendaye</a> but this is now downgraded to a departmental road D810. <a href="Route%20nationale">Route nationale</a> 117, linking Bayonne to Toulouse has been downgraded to departmental road D817.

There are several bridges over both the Nive and the Adour linking the various districts.

Coming from upstream on the Adour there is the A63 bridge, then the Saint-Frédéric bridge which carries the D 810, then the railway bridge that replaced the old Eiffel iron bridge, the Saint-Esprit bridge, and finally the Grenet bridge. The Saint-Esprit bridge connects the Saint-Esprit district to the Amiral-Bergeret dock just upstream of the confluence with the river Nive. In 1845 the old bridge, originally made ??of wood, was rebuilt in masonry with seven arches supporting a deck wide. It was then called the Nemours Bridge in honour of <a href="Prince%20Louis%2C%20Duke%20of%20Nemours">Louis of Orleans</a>, sixth Duke of Nemours, who laid the first stone. The bridge was finally called Saint-Esprit. Until 1868 the bridge had a moving span near the left bank. It was expanded in 1912 to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s and motor vehicles.

On the Nive coming from upstream to downstream there is the A63 bridge then the "Pont Blanc" (White bridge) railway bridge, and then D810 bridge, the Génie bridge (or "Pont Millitaire"), the Pannecau bridge, the Marengo bridge leading to the covered markets, and the Mayou Bridge The Pannecau bridge was long named "Bertaco bridge" and was rebuilt in masonry under <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>. According to François Lafitte Houssat, "[...] a municipal ordinance of 1327 provided for the imprisonment of any quarrellsome woman of bad character in an iron cage dropped into the waters of the Nive River from the bridge. The practice lasted until 1780 [...]" This punishment bore the evocative name of "cubainhade".

The commune is traversed by the "<a href="EV1%20The%20Atlantic%20Coast%20Route">Vélodyssée</a>". <a href="Cycling%20infrastructure">Bicycle paths</a> are located along the left bank of the Adour, a large part of the left bank of the Nive, and along various axes of the city where there are some bicycle lanes. The city offers free bicycles on loan.

Most of the lines of the "Chronoplus" bus network operated by the "Transdev agglomeration of Bayonne" link Bayonne to other communes in the urban transport perimeter: <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>, <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, <a href="Bidart">Bidart</a>, <a href="Boucau">Boucau</a>, <a href="Saint-Pierre-d%27Irube">Saint-Pierre-d'Irube</a> and <a href="Tarnos">Tarnos</a> The Bayonne free shuttle Bayonne serves the city centre (Grand and Petit Bayonne) by connecting several parking stations; other free shuttles perform other short trips within the commune.

Bayonne is connected to many cities in the western half of the department such as <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a> and <a href="Saint-Palais%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Saint-Palais</a> by the Pyrenees-Atlantiques long distance coach network of "Transport 64" managed by the General Council. Since the network restructuring in the summer of 2013, the lines converge on Bayonne. Bayonne is also served by services from the <a href="Landes%20%28department%29">Landes</a> departmental network, "XL'R".

The <a href="Gare%20de%20Bayonne">Gare de Bayonne</a> is located in the Saint-Esprit district and is an important station on the <a href="Bordeaux-Irun%20railway">Bordeaux-Irun railway</a>. It is also the terminus of lines leading from <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> to Bayonne and from Bayonne to <a href="Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port">Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port</a>. It is served by <a href="TGV">TGV</a>, <a href="Intercit%C3%A9s">Intercités</a>, <a href="Lun%C3%A9a">Lunéa</a>, and <a href="TER%20Aquitaine">TER Aquitaine</a> trains (to <a href="Hendaye">Hendaye</a>, <a href="Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port">Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port</a>, <a href="Dax%2C%20Landes">Dax</a>, <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a>, and <a href="Tarbes">Tarbes</a>).

Bayonne is served by the <a href="Biarritz%20%E2%80%93%20Anglet%20%E2%80%93%20Bayonne%20Airport">Biarritz – Anglet – Bayonne Airport</a> (<a href="IATA%20code">IATA code</a>: BIQ • <a href="ICAO%20airport%20code">ICAO code</a>: LFBZ), located on the communal territories of Anglet and Biarritz. The airport was returned to service in 1954 after repair of damage from bombing during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

Airport management is carried out by the joint association for the development and operation of the airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne, which includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bayonne Basque Country, the agglomeration of Côte Basque-Adour, the departments of Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Landes, and the commune of <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a>. The airport of Biarritz-Anglet-Bayonne had nearly 1.1 million passengers in 2013. It has regular connections to <a href="Paris-Orly">Paris-Orly</a>, <a href="Paris-CDG">Paris-CDG</a>, <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>, <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, and <a href="London%20Stansted">London Stansted</a> and from March to October 2014 had connections with: <a href="A%C3%A9roport%20de%20Marseille%20Provence">Marseille</a>, <a href="A%C3%A9roport%20de%20Strasbourg-Entzheim">Strasbourg</a>, <a href="A%C3%A9roport%20de%20Lille-Lesquin">Lille</a>, <a href="Brussels%20South%20Charleroi%20Airport">Brussels South Charleroi Airport</a>, <a href="Dublin%20Airport">Dublin</a>, <a href="Stockholm%20Skavsta%20Airport">Stockholm-Skavsta</a>, <a href="Stockholm%20Arlanda%20Airport">Stockholm-Arlanda</a>, <a href="Gatwick%20Airport">London-Gatwick</a>, <a href="Copenhagen%20Airport">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="Oslo%20Airport%2C%20Gardermoen">Oslo</a>, and <a href="Helsinki%20Airport">Helsinki</a>. Airline companies serving the airport at 1 November 2014 were: <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>, <a href="Etihad%20Regional">Etihad Regional</a>, <a href="EasyJet">EasyJet</a>, <a href="Finnair">Finnair</a>, <a href="Hop%21">Hop!</a>, <a href="Ryanair">Ryanair</a>, <a href="Scandinavian%20Airlines">SAS</a>, <a href="Twin%20Jet">Twin Jet</a>, and <a href="Volotea">Volotea</a>.

While the modern <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> spelling is "Baiona" and the same in <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> <a href="Occitan">Occitan</a>, "the name "Bayonne" poses a number of problems both historical and linguistic which have still not been clarified". There are different interpretations of its meaning.

The termination "-onne" in "Bayonne" can come from many in hydronyms "-onne" or toponyms derived from that. In certain cases the element "-onne" follows an Indo-European theme: "*ud-r/n" (Greek "húdōr" giving hydro, <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> "watt" meaning "water") hence "*udnā" meaning "water" giving "unna" then "onno" in the glossary of <a href="Vienne">Vienne</a>. "Unna" therefore would refer to the Adour. This toponymic type evoking a river traversing a locality is common. The appellative "unna" seems to be found in the name of the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> ("Garunna" 1st century; "Garonna" 4th century). However it is possible to see a pre-Celtic suffix "-ona" in the name of the <a href="Charente%20%28river%29">Charente</a> ("Karantona" in 875) or the <a href="Charentonne">Charentonne</a> ("Carentona" in 1050).

It could also be an augmentative <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> from the original <a href="Latin">Latin</a> radical "Baia-" with the suffix "-ona' in the sense of "vast expanse of water" or a name derived from the Basque "bai" meaning "river" and "ona" meaning "good", hence "good river".

The proposal by Eugene Goyheneche repeated by Manex Goyhenetche and supported by Jean-Baptiste Orpustan is "bai una", "the place of the river" or "bai ona" "hill by the river"—"Ibai" means "river" in Basque and "muinoa" means "hill".

"It has perhaps been lost from sight that many urban place names in France, from north to south, came from the element "Bay-" or "Bayon-" such as: <a href="Bayons">Bayons</a>, <a href="Bayonville">Bayonville</a>, <a href="Bayonvillers">Bayonvillers</a> and pose the unusual problem of whether they are Basque or Gascon"

adds Pierre Hourmat. However, the most ancient form of Bayonne: "Baiona", clearly indicates a feminine or a theme of "-a" whereas this is not the case for Béon or Bayon. In addition, the "Bayon-" in Bayonville or Bayonvillers in northern France is clearly the personal Germanic name "Baio".

The names of the Basque province of <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a> and the locality of Bayonne have been attested from an early period with the place name "Bayonne" appearing in the Latin form "Lapurdum" after a period during which the two names could in turn designate a Viscounty or Bishopric.

"Labourd" and "Bayonne" were synonymous and used interchangeably until the 12th century before being differentiated: Labord for the province and Bayonne for the city. The attribution of Bayonne as "Civitas Boatium", a place mentioned in the <a href="Antonine%20Itinerary">Antonine Itinerary</a> and by Paul Raymond in his 1863 dictionary, has been abandoned. The city of the "Boïates" may possibly be <a href="La%20Teste-de-Buch">La Teste-de-Buch</a> but is certainly not Bayonne.

The following table details the origins of Labord, Bayonne, and other names in the commune.

Origins:

In the absence of accurate objective data there is some credence to the probable existence of a fishing village on the site in a period prior to <a href="ancient%20times">ancient times</a>. Numerous traces of human occupation have been found in the Bayonne region from the <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Paleolithic</a> especially in the discoveries at <a href="Saint-Pierre-d%27Irube">Saint-Pierre-d'Irube</a>, a neighbouring locality. On the other hand, the presence of a mound about high has been detected in the current Cathedral Quarter overlooking the Nive which formed a natural protection and a usable port on the left bank of the Nive. At the time the mound was surrounded north and west by the Adour swamps. At its foot lies the famous "Bayonne Sea"—the junction of the two rivers—which may have been about wide between Saint-Esprit and the Grand Bayonne and totally covered the current location of Bourg-Neuf (in the district of Petit Bayonne). To the south the last bend of the Nive widens near the Saint-Léon hills. Despite this, the narrowing of the Adour valley allows easier crossing than anywhere else along the entire length of the estuary.

In conclusion, the strategic importance of this height was so obvious it must be presumed that it has always been inhabited.

The oldest documented human occupation site is located on a hill overlooking the Nive and its confluence with the Adour.

In the 1st century AD, during the Roman occupation, Bayonne already seems to have been of some importance since the Romans surrounded the city with a wall to keep out the <a href="Tarbelli">Tarbelli</a>, <a href="Aquitani">Aquitani</a>, or the <a href="proto-Basque">proto-Basque</a> who then occupied a territory that extended south of modern-day <a href="Landes%20%28department%29">Landes</a>, to the modern French Basque country, the <a href="Chalosse">Chalosse</a>, the valleys of the <a href="Adour">Adour</a>, the mountain streams of <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques</a>, and to the <a href="Gave%20d%27Oloron">Gave d'Oloron</a>.

The archaeological discoveries of October and November 1995 provided a shred of evidence to support this projection. In the four layers of sub-soil along the foundation of the Gothic cathedral (in the "apse of the cathedral" area) a 2-metre depth was found of old objects from the end of the 1st century—in particular sigillated Gallic ceramics from <a href="Montans">Montans</a> imitating Italian styles, thin-walled bowls, and fragments of <a href="amphorae">amphorae</a>. In the "southern sector" near the cloister door there were objects from the second half of the 1st century as well as coins from the first half of the 3rd century.

A very high probability of human presence, not solely military, seems to provisionally confirm the occupation of the site at least around the 3rd century.

A Roman <a href="Castra">castrum</a> dating to the end of the 4th century has been proven as a fortified place of <a href="Novempopulania">Novempopulania</a>. Named "Lapurdum", the name became the name of the province of "Labourd". According to Eugene Goyheneche the name "Baiona" designated the city, the port, and the cathedral while that of "Lapurdum" was only a territorial designation. This Roman settlement was strategic as it allowed the monitoring of the trans-Pyrenean roads and of local people rebellious to the Roman power. The construction covered 6 to 10 hectares according to several authors. 

The geographical location of the locality at the crossroads of a river system oriented from east to west and the road network connecting Europe to the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> from north to south predisposed the site to the double role of fortress and port. The city, after being Roman, alternated between the <a href="Vascones">Vascones</a> and the English for three centuries from the 12th to the 15th century.

The Romans left the city in the 4th century and the Basques, who had always been present, dominated the former Novempopulania province between the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a>, the Ocean, and the Pyrénées. Novempopulania was renamed <a href="Vasconia">Vasconia</a> and then Gascony after a Germanic deformation (resulting from the <a href="Visigoth">Visigoth</a> and <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> invasions). Basquisation of the plains region was too weak against the advance of romanization. From the mixture between the Basque and Latin language <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> was created.

Documentation on Bayonne for the period from the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a> are virtually nonexistent. with the exception of two Norman intrusions: one questionable in 844 and a second attested in 892.

When Labourd was created in 1023 Bayonne was the capital and the Viscount resided there. The history of Bayonne proper started in 1056 when Raymond II the Younger, Bishop of Bazas, had the mission to build the Church of Bayonne

The construction was under the authority of Raymond III of Martres, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bayonne">Bishop of Bayonne</a> from 1122 to 1125, combined with Viscount Bertrand for the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> cathedral, the rear of which can still be seen today, and the first wooden bridge across the Adour extending the Mayou bridge over the Nive, which inaugurated the heyday of Bayonne. From 1120 new districts were created under population pressure. The development of areas between the old Roman city of Grand Bayonne and the Nive also developed during this period, then between the Nive and the Adour at the place that became Petit Bayonne. A <a href="Jacobin">Jacobin</a> Convent was located there in 1225 then that of the <a href="Cordeliers">Cordeliers</a> in 1247. Construction of and modifications to the defences of the city also developed to protect the new districts.

In 1130 the King of Aragon <a href="Alfonso%20the%20Battler">Alfonso the Battler</a> besieged the city without success. Bayonne came under English rule when <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> married <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> in 1152. This alliance gave Bayonne many commercial privileges. The Bayonnaises became carriers of Bordeaux wines and other south-western products like resin, ham, and <a href="Isatis%20tinctoria">woad</a> to England. Bayonne was then an important military base. In 1177 King Richard separated the Viscounty of Labourd whose capital then became <a href="Ustaritz">Ustaritz</a>. Like many cities at the time, in 1215 Bayonne obtained the award of a municipal charter and was emancipated from feudal powers.

The official publication in 1273 of a <a href="Coutume">Coutume</a> unique to the city, remained in force for five centuries until the separation of Bayonne from Labourd. 

Bayonnaise industry at that time was dominated by shipbuilding: wood (<a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="beech">beech</a>, <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a> from the Pyrenees, and <a href="pine">pine</a> from <a href="Landes%20forest">Landes</a>) being overabundant. There was also maritime activity in providing crews for <a href="whaling">whaling</a>, commercial marine or, and it was often so at a time when it was easy to turn any merchant ship into a warship, the English <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. 

<a href="Jean%20de%20Dunois">Jean de Dunois</a> - a former companion at arms of <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>—captured the city on 20 August 1451 and annexed it to the Crown "without making too many victims", but at the cost of a war indemnity of 40,000 gold <a href="%C3%89cu">Écu</a>s payable in a year,—thanks to the opportunism of the bishop who claimed to have seen "a large white cross surmounted by a crown which turns into a fleur-de-lis in the sky" to dissuade Bayonne from fighting against the royal troops. 

The city continued to be fortified by the kings of France to protect it from danger from the Spanish border. In 1454 <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles VII</a> created a separate judicial district: the "<a href="Seneschal">Seneschal</a> of Lannes" a "single subdivision of <a href="Guyenne">Guyenne</a> during the English period" which had jurisdiction over a wide area including Bayonne, <a href="Dax%2C%20Landes">Dax</a> and <a href="Saint-Sever">Saint-Sever</a> and which exercised civil justice, criminal jurisdiction within the competence of the district councilors. Over time, the "Seneschal of the Sword" which was at Dax lost any role other than protocol and Bayonne, along with Dax and Saint-Sever, became the de facto seat of a separate Seneschal under the authority of a "lieutenant-general of the Seneschal".

In May 1462 King <a href="Louis%20XI">Louis XI</a> authorized the holding of two annual fairs by letters patent after signing the Treaty of Bayonne after which it was confirmed by the coutoumes of the inhabitants in July 1472 following the death of <a href="Charles%20de%20Valois%2C%20Duke%20de%20Berry">Charles de Valois, Duke de Berry</a>, the king's brother.

At the time the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> raged in the Iberian Peninsula Jews left Spain, and especially Portugal, then settled in Saint-Esprit. They brought with them <a href="chocolate">chocolate</a> and the recipe for its preparation. The golden age of the city ended in the 15th century with the loss of trade with England and the silting of the port of Bayonne created by the movement of the course of the Adour to the north.

At the beginning of the 16th century Labourd saw the emergence of the <a href="Bubonic%20plague">plague</a>. Its path can be tracked by reading the "Registers". In July 1515 the city of Bayonne was "prohibited to welcome people from plague-stricken places" and on 21 October, "we inhibit and prohibit all peasants and residents of this city [...] to go Parish Bidart [...] because of the contagion of the plague". On 11 April 1518 the plague raged in <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a> and the city of Bayonne "inhibited and prohibited for all peasants and city inhabitants and other foreigners to maintain relationships at the location and Parish of Saint-Jean-de-Luz where people have died of the plague". On 11 November 1518 plague was present in Bayonne to the point that in 1519 the city council moved to the district of Brindos (Berindos at the time) in <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>.

In 1523 Marshal <a href="Odet%20of%20Foix%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Lautrec">Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec</a> resisted the Spaniards under <a href="Philibert%20of%20Chalon">Philibert of Chalon</a> in the service of <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V</a> and lifted the siege of Bayonne. It was at Château-Vieux that the ransom demand for the release of Francis I, taken prisoner after his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pavia">Battle of Pavia</a>, was gathered. 

The meeting in 1565 between <a href="Catherine%20de%20Medici">Catherine de Medici</a> and the envoy of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a>: the Duke of Alba, is known as the "Interview of Bayonne". At the time that <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> and <a href="Protestants">Protestants</a> tore each other apart in parts of the kingdom of France, Bayonne seemed relatively untouched by these troubles. An iron fist from the city leaders did not appear to be unknown. In fact they never hesitated to use violence and criminal sanctions for keeping order in the name of the "public good". Two brothers, Saubat and Johannes Sorhaindo who were both lieutenants of the mayor of Bayonne in the second half of the 16th century, perfectly embody this period. They often wavered between Catholicism and Protestantism but always wanted to ensure the unity and prestige of the city.

In the 16th century the king's engineers, under the direction of Louis de Foix, were dispatched to rearrange the course of the Adour by creating an estuary to maintain the river bed. The river discharged in the right place to the Ocean on 28 October 1578.} The port of Bayonne then attained a greater level of activity. Fishing for <a href="cod">cod</a> and <a href="whale">whale</a> ensured the wealth of fishermen and shipowners.

From 1611 to 1612 the college Principal of Bayonne was a man of 26 years old with a future: <a href="Cornelius%20Jansen">Cornelius Jansen</a> known as "Jansénius", the future <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ypres">Bishop of Ypres</a>. Bayonne became the birthplace of <a href="Jansenism">Jansenism</a>, an austere science which strongly disrupted the monarchy of <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>.

During the sporadic conflicts that troubled the French countryside from the mid 17th century, Bayonne peasants were short of powder and projectiles. They attached the long hunting knives in the barrels of their muskets and that way they fashioned makeshift spears later called "<a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s". In that same century, <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Prestre%20de%20Vauban">Vauban</a> was charged by <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> to fortify the city. He added a citadel built on a hill overlooking the district of "San Espirit Cap deou do Punt".

Activity in Bayonne peaked in the 18th century. The Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1726. Trade with <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the <a href="Antilles">Antilles</a>, the cod fishery off the shores of <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, and construction sites maintained a high level of activity in the port.

In 1792 the district of Saint-Esprit (that revolutionaries renamed "Port-de-la-Montagne") located on the right bank of the Adour, was separated from the city and renamed "Jean-Jacques Rousseau". It was reunited with Bayonne on 1 June 1857. For 65 years the autonomous commune was part of the department of <a href="Landes%20%28department%29">Landes</a>.

In 1808 at the Château of Marracq the act of abdication of the Spanish king <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Charles IV</a> in favour of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> was signed under the "friendly pressure" of the Emperor. In the process the <a href="Bayonne%20Statute">Bayonne Statute</a> was initialed as the first Spanish constitution.

Also in 1808 the French Empire imposed on the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a> the Convention of Bayonne to buy from France the debts owed to it by <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. The debt, amounting to more than 43 million <a href="franc">franc</a>s in gold, was bought at a discounted rate of 21 million francs. However, although the duchy made its payments in installments to France over a four-year period, Prussia was unable to pay it (due to a very large indemnity it owed to France resulting from <a href="Treaties%20of%20Tilsit">Treaties of Tilsit</a>), causing the Polish economy to suffer heavily.

Trade was the wealth of the city in the 18th century but suffered greatly in the 19th century, severely sanctioned by <a href="Peninsular%20War">conflict with Spain</a>, its historic trading partner in the region. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Bayonne">Siege of Bayonne</a> marked the end of the period with the surrender of the Napoleonic troops of Marshal <a href="Jean-de-Dieu%20Soult">Jean-de-Dieu Soult</a> who were defeated by the coalition led by <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Wellington</a> on 5 May 1814.

In 1854 the railway arrived from Paris bringing many tourists eager to enjoy the beaches of <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>. Bayonne turned instead to the <a href="steel">steel</a> industry with the forges of the Adour. The Port took on an industrial look but its slow decline seemed inexorable in the 19th century. The discovery of the Lacq gas field restored a certain dynamism.

The Treaty of Bayonne was concluded on 2 December 1856. It overcame the disputes in fixing the Franco-Spanish border in the area extending from the mouth of the <a href="Bidassoa">Bidassoa</a> to the border between <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> and <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>.

The city built three light railway lines to connect to Biarritz at the beginning of the 20th century. The most direct line, that of the "Tramway Bayonne-Lycée–Biarritz" was operated from 1888 to 1948. In addition a line further north served Anglet, operated by the "Chemin de fer Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz" company from 1877 to 1953. Finally a line following the Adour to its mouth and to the Atlantic Ocean by the bar in Anglet, was operated by "VFDM réseau basque" from 1919 to 1948.

On the morning of 23 December 1933, sub-prefect Anthelme received Gustave Tissier, the director of the "Crédit Municipal de Bayonne". He responded well, with some astonishment, to his persistent interview. It did not surprise him to see the man unpacking what became the scam of the century.

"Tissier, director of the "Crédit Municipal", was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of forgery and misappropriation of public funds. He had issued thousands of false bonds in the name of "Crédit Municipal" [...]"

This was the beginning of the <a href="Stavisky%20Affair">Stavisky Affair</a> which, together with other scandals and political crises, led to the Paris riots of 6 February 1934.

The 249th Infantry Regiment, created from the 49th Infantry Regiment, was engaged in operations in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, including action at <a href="Chemin%20des%20Dames">Chemin des Dames</a>, especially on the plateau of <a href="Craonne">Craonne</a>. 700 Bayonnaises perished in the conflict. A centre for engagement of foreign volunteers was established in August 1914 in Bayonne. Many nationalities were represented, particularly the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Czechs, and the Poles 

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Bayonne was occupied by the <a href="3rd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Totenkopf">3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf</a> from 27 June 1940 to 23 August 1944.

On 5 April 1942 the Allies made a landing attempt in Bayonne but after a barge penetrated the Adour with great difficulty, the operation was canceled.

On 21 August 1944, after blowing up twenty ships in port, German troops withdrew. On the 22nd a final convoy of five vehicles passed through the city. It transported Gestapo Customs agents and some elements of the "Feldgendarmerie". One or more Germans opened fire with machine guns killing three people. On the 23rd there was an informal and immediate installation of a "special municipal delegation" by the young deputy prefect Guy Lamassoure representing the <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20French%20Republic">Provisional Government of the French Republic</a> which had been established in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> since 27 June.

The <a href="Duke%20of%20Gramont">Gramont family</a> provided captains and governors in Bayonne from 1472 to 1789 as well as mayors, a post which became hereditary from 28 January 1590 by concession of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry IV</a> to Antoine II of Gramont. From the 15th century they resided in the Château Neuf then in the Château-Vieux from the end of the 16th century:

(Not all data is known)

As per the Decree of 22 December 1789 Bayonne was part of two cantons: Bayonne-North-east, which includes part of Bayonne commune plus <a href="Boucau">Boucau</a>, <a href="Saint-Pierre-d%27Irube">Saint-Pierre-d'Irube</a>, <a href="Lahonce">Lahonce</a>, <a href="Mouguerre">Mouguerre</a>, and <a href="Urcuit">Urcuit</a>; and Bayonne Northwest which consisted of the rest of Bayonne commune plus <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>, <a href="Arcangues">Arcangues</a>, and <a href="Bassussarry">Bassussarry</a>.

In a first revision of cantons in 1973 three cantons were created from the same total; geographic area: Bayonne North, Bayonne East, and Bayonne West. A further reconfiguration in 1982 focused primarily on Bayonne and, apart from Bayonne North Canton, which also includes Boucau, the cantons of Bayonne East and Bayonne West did not change.

Starting from the <a href="French%20departmental%20elections%2C%202015">French departmental elections, 2015</a> which took place on 22 and 29 March, a new division took effect following the decree of 25 February 2014 Once again three cantons centred on Bayonne are defined: <a href="Canton%20of%20Bayonne-1">Bayonne-1</a>—with part of Anglet; <a href="Canton%20of%20Bayonne-2">Bayonne-2</a>—which includes Boucau; and <a href="Canton%20of%20Bayonne-3">Bayonne-3</a> now define the cantonal territorial division of the area.

The commune is part of twelve inter-communal structures of which eleven are based in the commune:


The city of Bayonne is part of the "Agglomeration Côte Basque-Adour" which also includes Anglet, Biarritz, Bidart and Boucau. The statutory powers of the structure extend to economic development—including higher education and research—housing and urban planning, public transport—through Transdev—alternative and the collection and recovery waste collection and management of rain and coastal waters, the sustainable development, interregional cooperation and finally 106.

In addition Bayonne is part of the Basque Bayonne-San Sebastián Eurocity which is a <a href="European%20economic%20interest%20grouping">European economic interest grouping</a> (EEIG) established in 1993 based in <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a>.

Bayonne has <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twinning</a> associations with:
In 2012 the commune had 45,855 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known from the population censuses conducted in the commune since 1793. From the 21st century, a census of communes with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants is held every five years, unlike larger communes that have a sample survey every year.

Bayonne commune is attached to the Academy of Bordeaux. It has an information and guidance center (CIO).

On 14 December 2015 Bayonne had 10 kindergartens, 22 elementary or primary schools (12 public and 10 private primary schools including two ikastolas). 2 public colleges (Albert Camus and Marracq colleges), 5 private colleges (La Salle Saint-Bernard, Saint Joseph, Saint-Amand, Notre-Dame and Largenté) which meet the criteria of the first cycle of second degree studies.

An annual summer festival has been held in the commune since 1932 for five days organized around parades, bulls races, <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a>, and music in the Basque and Gascon tradition. These festivals have become the most important festive events in France in terms of attendance.

Bayonne has the oldest French bullfighting tradition. A bylaw regulating the "encierro" is dated 1283: cows, oxen and bulls are released each year in the streets of Petit Bayonne during the summer festivals. The current arena, opened in 1893, is the largest in South-west France with more than 10,000 seats. A dozen bullfights are held each year, attracting the biggest names in bullfighting. Throughout summer several "novilladas" also take place. The city is a member of the "Union of French bullfighting cities".

Bayonne is the focus of much of the hospital services for the agglomeration of Bayonne and the southern Landes. In this area all inhabitants are less than 35 km from a hospital offering medical, obstetrical, surgical, or psychiatric care. The hospitals for all the Basque Coast are mainly established in Bayonne (the main site of Saint-Léon and Cam-de-Prats) and also in <a href="Saint-Jean-de-Luz">Saint-Jean-de-Luz</a> which has several clinics.

The "Way of Baztan" (also "ruta del Baztan" or "camino Baztanés") is a way on the pilgrimage of <a href="Camino%20de%20Santiago">Camino de Santiago</a> which crosses the Pyrenees further west by the lowest pass (by the "Col de Belate", 847 m). It is the ancient road used by pilgrims descending to Bayonne then either along the coast on the "Way of Soulac" or because they landed there from England, for example, to join the <a href="French%20Way">French Way</a> as soon as possible in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>. The "Way of Bayonne" joins the French Way further downstream at <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>.

The <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> was built in 1837 in the Saint-Esprit district north of the town. The Jewish community of Bayonne is old—it consists of different groups of fugitives from Navarre and Portugal who established at SAint-Esprit-lès-Bayonne after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1496. In 1846 the <a href="Central%20Consistory">Central Consistory</a> moved to Saint-Esprit which was integrated with Bayonne in 1857.

Bayonne is the economic capital of the agglomeration of Bayonne and southern Landes. The table below details the number of companies located in Bayonne according to their industry:

The table below shows employees by business establishments in terms of numbers:

The following comments apply to the two previous tables:

In 2013 549 new establishments were created in Bayonne including 406 <a href="Sole%20proprietorship">Sole proprietorship</a>s. 

Bayonne has few such industries, as indicated in the previous tables. There is "Plastitube" specializing in plastic packaging (190 employees). The <a href="Izarra%20%28liqueur%29">Izarra</a> liqueur company set up a distillery in 1912 at Quai Amiral-Bergeret and has long symbolized the economic wealth of Bayonne. Industrial activities are concentrated in the neighbouring communes of <a href="Boucau">Boucau</a>, <a href="Tarnos">Tarnos</a> (<a href="Turbomeca">Turbomeca</a>), <a href="Mouguerre">Mouguerre</a>, and <a href="Anglet">Anglet</a>.

Bayonne is known for its fine chocolates, produced in the town for 500 years, and Bayonne ham, a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby <a href="Espelette">Espelette</a>. <a href="Izarra%20%28liqueur%29">Izarra</a>, the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of <a href="mayonnaise">mayonnaise</a>, supposedly a corruption of "Bayonnaise", the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.

Bayonne is now the centre of certain craft industries that were once widespread, including the manufacture of "<a href="makila">makila</a>s", traditional Basque walking-sticks. The Fabrique Alza just outside the city is known for its "palas", bats used in "<a href="Basque%20pelota">pelota</a>", the traditional Basque sport.

The active tertiary sector includes some large retail chains such as those detailed by geographer <a href="Roger%20Brunet">Roger Brunet</a>: BUT (240 staff), <a href="Carrefour">Carrefour</a> (150 staff), <a href="E.Leclerc">E.Leclerc</a> (150 staff), <a href="Leroy%20Merlin">Leroy Merlin</a> (130 staff), and <a href="Galeries%20Lafayette">Galeries Lafayette</a> (120 employees).

Five health clinics, providing a total of more than 500 beds, each employ 120 to 170 staff.

The port of Bayonne is located at the mouth of the Adour, downstream of the city. It also occupies part of communes of Anglet and Boucau in <a href="Pyrenees-Atlantiques">Pyrenees-Atlantiques</a> and <a href="Tarnos">Tarnos</a> in <a href="Landes%20%28department%29">Landes</a>. It benefits greatly from the natural gas field of Lacq to which it is connected by pipeline. This is the 9th largest French port for trade with an annual traffic of about 4.2 million tonnes of which 2.8 is export. It is also the largest French port for export of <a href="maize">maize</a>. It is the property of the Aquitaine region who manage and control the site. Metallurgical products movement are more than one million tons per year and maize exports to Spain vary between 800,000 and 1 million tons. The port also receives refined oil products from the <a href="Total%20S.A.">Total</a> oil refinery at <a href="Donges">Donges</a> (800,000 tons per year). Fertilizers are a traffic of 500,000 tons per year and <a href="sulphur">sulphur</a> from Lacq, albeit in sharp decline, is 400,000 tons.

The port also receives <a href="Ford">Ford</a> and <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> vehicles from Spain and Portugal and wood both tropical and from Landes.

Due to its proximity to the ocean and the foothills of the Pyrenees as well as its historic heritage, Bayonne has developed important activities related to tourism.

On 31 December 2012 there were 15 hotels in the city offering more than 800 rooms to visitors, but there were no camp sites. The tourist infrastructure in the surrounding urban area of Bayonne complements the local supply with around 5800 rooms spread over nearly 200 hotels and 86 campsites offering over 14,000 beds.

The Nive divides Bayonne into Grand Bayonne and Petit Bayonne with five bridges between the two, both quarters still being backed by <a href="Vauban">Vauban</a>'s walls. The houses lining the Nive are examples of Basque architecture, with half-timbering and shutters in the national colours of red and green. The much wider Adour is to the north. The Pont Saint-Esprit connects Petit Bayonne with the Quartier Saint-Esprit across the <a href="Adour">Adour</a>, where the massive Citadelle and the railway station are located. Grand Bayonne is the commercial and civic hub, with small pedestrianised streets packed with shops, plus the cathedral and <a href="City%20and%20town%20halls">Hôtel de Ville</a>.

The <a href="Bayonne%20Cathedral">Cathédrale Sainte-Marie</a> is an imposing, elegant <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> building, rising over the houses, glimpsed along the narrow streets. It was constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. The south tower was completed in the 16th century but the cathedral was only completed in the 19th century with the north tower. The cathedral is noted for its charming <a href="cloister">cloister</a>s. There are other details and sculptures of note, although much was destroyed in the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a>.

Nearby is the Château Vieux, some of which dates back to the 12th century, where the governors of the city were based, including the English <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Black Prince</a>.
The Musée Basque is the finest ethnographic museum of the entire Basque Country. It opened in 1922 but has been closed for a decade recently for refurbishment. It now has special exhibitions on Basque agriculture, seafaring and "<a href="Basque%20pelota">pelota</a>", handicrafts and Basque history and way of life.

The <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20Bonnat">Musée Bonnat</a> began with a large collection bequeathed by the local-born painter <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bonnat">Léon Bonnat</a>. The museum is one of the best galleries in south west France and has paintings by <a href="Edgar%20Degas">Edgar Degas</a>, <a href="El%20Greco">El Greco</a>, <a href="Sandro%20Botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</a>, and <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>, among others.

At the back of Petit Bayonne is the Château Neuf, among the ramparts. Now an exhibition space, it was started by the newly arrived French in 1460 to control the city. The walls nearby have been opened to visitors. They are important for plant life now and Bayonne's <a href="Jardin%20botanique%20de%20Bayonne">botanic gardens</a> adjoin the walls on both sides of the Nive.

The area across the Adour is largely residential and industrial, with much demolished to make way for the railway. The Saint-Esprit church was part of a bigger complex built by <a href="Louis%20XI%20of%20France">Louis XI</a> to care for <a href="Way%20of%20St%20James">pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela</a>.

Bubblegum Crisis

The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a> who don <a href="powered%20exoskeleton">powered exoskeleton</a>s and fight various problems, most frequently rogue robots. The success of the series spawned <a href="%23Spin-offs">several sequel series.</a>

The series begins in late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto earthquake has split <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> geographically and culturally in two. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan. The main antagonist is Genom, a <a href="megacorporation">megacorporation</a> with immense power and global influence. Its main product are <a href="Boomer%20%28Bubblegum%20Crisis%29">boomers</a>—artificial cybernetic life forms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machine; also known as "cyberoids". While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The AD Police are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series' themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, <a href="red%20tape">red tape</a>, and an insufficient budget.

The setting displays strong influences from the movies "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" and "<a href="Streets%20of%20Fire">Streets of Fire</a>". The opening sequence of episode 1 is modeled on the opening sequence of "Streets of Fire". The humanoid robots known as "boomers" in the series also resemble Terminators cyborgs from the "<a href="The%20Terminator">Terminator</a>" film.

Suzuki explained in a 1993 "<a href="Animerica">Animerica</a>" interview the meaning behind the cryptic title: "We originally named the series 'bubblegum' to reflect a world in crisis, like a chewing-gum bubble that's about to burst."

The series started with <a href="Toshimichi%20Suzuki">Toshimichi Suzuki</a> intention to remake the 1982 film <a href="Techno%20Police%2021C">Techno Police 21C</a>. However, he met <a href="Junji%20Fujita">Junji Fujita</a> and the two discussed ideas, and decided to collaborate on what later became Bubblegum Crisis. <a href="Kenichi%20Sonoda">Kenichi Sonoda</a> acted as character designer, and designed the four female leads. <a href="Masami%20Obari">Masami Obari</a> created the mechanical designs. Obari would also go on to direct episode 5 and 6.

The OVA series is eight episodes long but was originally slated to run for 13 episodes.
Due to legal problems between <a href="Artmic">Artmic</a> and <a href="Youmex">Youmex</a>, who jointly held the rights to the series, the series was discontinued prematurely.

In North America, <a href="AnimEigo">AnimEigo</a> first released Bubblegum Crisis to VHS and Laserdisc in 1991 in Japanese with English subtitles. The series is notable in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from <a href="Japan">Japan</a> unedited and subtitled in English. While anime has become much more popular in the years since, in 1991, it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America. Bubblegum Crisis was aired in the US when it first aired on PBS' San Jose affiliate <a href="KTEH-TV">KTEH</a> in the 1990s, and <a href="STARZ%21">STARZ!</a>'s Action Channel in 2000.

An English dub of the series was produced beginning in 1994 by AnimEigo through Southwynde Studios in Wilmington, NC, and released to VHS and Laserdisc beginning that year. A digitally-remastered compilation, featuring bilingual audio tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by AnimEigo. The company later successfully crowdfunded a collector's edition Blu-ray release through <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> in November 2013.

There are 8 soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous "vocal" albums which feature songs "inspired by" the series as well as many drawn directly from it.

<a href="Masaki%20Kajishima">Masaki Kajishima</a> and <a href="Hiroki%20Hayashi">Hiroki Hayashi</a>, who both worked on the "Bubblegum Crisis" OAVs, cite the show as being the inspiration for their harem series "<a href="Tenchi%20Muyo%21%20Ryo-Ohki">Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki</a>". In an interview with AIC, Hayashi described "Bubblegum Crisis" as "a pretty gloomy anime. Serious fighting, complicated human relationships, and dark Mega Tokyo." They thought it would be fun to create some comedy episodes with ideas like the girls going to the hot springs, but it was rejected by the sponsors. He also said that there was a trend to have a bunch of characters of one gender and a single one of the other gender, and asked what if Mackey (Sylia's brother) was a main character, reversing the "Bubblegum" scenario. This idea then became the basis for Tenchi. Hayashi said that Mackey is "sort of" the original model for Tenchi.

<a href="Kevin%20Siembieda">Kevin Siembieda</a>'s becoming aware of "Boomers" being already in use in this caused him to changed his planned name for the <a href="Rifts%20RPG">Rifts RPG</a> which he had named after the "Boom Gun"-wielding power armor which was also renamed to "Glitter Boy".

The success of the series spawned several sequel series. The first of them was the three-part OVA . After the split between Artmic and Youmex, Artmic proceeded to make a sequel on their own, "Bubblegum Crash", which ran three OVA episodes and is conjectured that it was a shortened version of how "Crisis" was to end. Youmex promptly sued Artmic, cutting "Crash" short and tying the entire franchise up in legal issues for the next several years.

It is set in 2034, and the Knight Sabers seem to be finished; each of its members - except Nene - have seemingly drifted off to pursue their own goals. But at the same time, parts of a unique <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are stolen by several villains acting under the orders of a mysterious voice. Unexpectedly, Sylia resurfaces and prepares her teammates for battle. And as a gigantic machine drills its way to Mega Tokyo's main nuclear power plant, they meet again with an old and deadly enemy.


In 1993, it appeared on "<a href="Gall%20Force%23Ten%20Little%20Gall%20Force%20%26amp%3B%20Scramble%20Wars">Scramble Wars</a>", a crossover event between "Bubblegum Crisis", "Gall Force", "<a href="Genesis%20Survivor%20Gaiarth">Genesis Survivor Gaiarth</a>", "AD Police" and "<a href="Riding%20Bean">Riding Bean</a>".



In Japan, a number of comic books were produced that featured characters and storylines based in the same universe. Some were very much thematically linked to the OVA series, while others were "one-shots" or comedy features. A number of artists participated in the creation of these comics, including <a href="Kenichi%20Sonoda">Kenichi Sonoda</a>, who had produced the original Knight Saber character designs. A North American comic based in the Bubblegum Crisis Universe was published in <a href="English%20language">English</a> by <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>.



In May 2009 it was announced that a <a href="live-action">live-action</a> movie of "Bubblegum Crisis" was in the early stages of production. A production agreement was signed at the 2009 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The film was expected to be released in late 2012 with a budget of 30 million. The production staff was said to have consulted with the original anime's staff members, <a href="Shinji%20Aramaki">Shinji Aramaki</a> and <a href="Kenichi%20Sonoda">Kenichi Sonoda</a>, to help maintain consistency with the world of the original. However, no further developments have been announced.

Black people

Black people is a term used in certain countries, often in socially based systems of <a href="racial%20classification">racial classification</a> or of ethnicity, to describe persons who are perceived to be <a href="Dark%20skin">dark-skinned</a> compared to other given populations. As such, the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies, and depends significantly on context. For many other individuals, communities and countries, "black" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined.

Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as "black", and these <a href="Social%20construction">social constructs</a> have also changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for "blackness" vary. For example, in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> the term "black people" is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin, but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, with a family history typically associated with <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">institutionalized slavery</a>. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, "black" was historically equivalent with "<a href="person%20of%20color">person of color</a>", a general term for non-European peoples. In South Africa and Latin America, mixed-race people are generally not classified as "black". In other regions such as <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, settlers applied the term "black" or it was used by local populations with different histories and ancestral backgrounds.

The <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> interacted with and later conquered parts of <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a>, an early state that covered modern <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, western <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, and the Spanish cities <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> and <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a> during the classical period. The people of the region were noted in <a href="Classical%20literature">Classical literature</a> as "<a href="Mauri%20%28people%29">Mauri</a>", which was subsequently rendered as <a href="Moors">Moors</a> in English.

Numerous communities of dark-skinned peoples are present in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, some dating from prehistoric communities. Others are descendants of the historical <a href="Trans-Saharan%20trade">Trans-Saharan trade</a> in peoples and/or, and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, descendants of slaves from the <a href="Arab%20Slave%20Trade">Arab Slave Trade</a> in North Africa.

In the 18th century, the Moroccan Sultan <a href="Moulay%20Ismail">Moulay Ismail</a> "the Bloodthirsty" (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his <a href="Black%20Guard">Black Guard</a>, who coerced the country into submission.

According to Dr. <a href="Carlos%20Moore%20%28writer%29">Carlos Moore</a>, resident scholar at Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, in the 21st century Afro-multiracials in the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> world, including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify in ways that resemble multi-racials in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. He claims that black-looking Arabs, much like black-looking <a href="Latin%20Americans">Latin Americans</a>, consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry.

Egyptian President <a href="Anwar%20Sadat">Anwar Sadat</a> had a mother who was a dark-skinned Nubian <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>ese woman and a father who was a lighter-skinned <a href="Egyptians">Egyptian</a>. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, as a young man he said, "I am not white but I am not exactly black either. My blackness is tending to reddish".
Due to the <a href="Patriarchy">patriarchal</a> nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more black women than men. They used more black female slaves in domestic service and agriculture than males. The men interpreted the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see <a href="Ma%20malakat%20aymanukum%20and%20sex">Ma malakat aymanukum and sex</a>), leading to many <a href="mixed-race">mixed-race</a> children. When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she was considered as "umm walad" or "mother of a child", a status that granted her privileged rights. The child was given rights of inheritance to the father's property, so mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father. Because the society was <a href="patrilineal">patrilineal</a>, the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free.

Some succeeded their fathers as rulers, such as Sultan <a href="Ahmad%20al-Mansur">Ahmad al-Mansur</a>, who ruled <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> from 1578 to 1608. He was not technically considered as a mixed-race child of a slave; his mother was <a href="Fulani">Fulani</a> and a <a href="concubine">concubine</a> of his father. Such tolerance for black persons, even when technically "free", was not so common in Morocco. The long association of sub-Saharan peoples as slaves is shown in the term "abd" () (meaning "slave"); it is still frequently used in the Arabic-speaking world as a term for black people.

In early 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs (specifically, people of <a href="Nilotic%20peoples">Nilotic</a> descent). Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens. The government was accused of "deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing.

<a href="American%20University">American University</a> economist <a href="George%20Ayittey">George Ayittey</a> accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens. According to Ayittey, "In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid." Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid.

<a href="Alan%20Dershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a> described Sudan as an example of a government that "actually deserve(s)" the appellation "apartheid." Former Canadian Minister of Justice <a href="Irwin%20Cotler">Irwin Cotler</a> echoed the accusation.

In the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, the native <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a> <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> populations kept "<a href="Negro">Negro</a>" slaves. Most of these captives were of <a href="Nilotic%20peoples">Nilotic</a> extraction, and were either purchased by the Tuareg nobles from slave markets in the <a href="Sudan%20%28region%29">Western Sudan</a> or taken during raids. Their origin is denoted via the <a href="Tamahaq%20language">Ahaggar Berber</a> word "<a href="Ikelan">Ibenheren</a>" (sing. "Ébenher"), which alludes to slaves that only speak a <a href="Nilo-Saharan%20languages">Nilo-Saharan</a> language. These slaves were also sometimes known by the borrowed <a href="Songhay%20languages">Songhay</a> term "Bella".

Similarly, the <a href="Sahrawi%20people">Sahrawi</a> autochthones of the <a href="Western%20Sahara">Western Sahara</a> observed a class system consisting of high <a href="caste">caste</a>s and low castes. Outside of these traditional tribal boundaries were "Negro" slaves, who were drawn from the surrounding areas.

In parts of the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, the local <a href="Afroasiatic%20languages">Afroasiatic</a> (Hamitic-Semitic) speaking populations have long adhered to a construct similar to that of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. In <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, the slave classes mainly consisted of individuals of Nilotic and <a href="Bantus%20%28Somalia%29">Bantu</a> origin who were collectively known as "<a href="Shanqella">Shanqella</a>" and "Adone" (both denoting "Negro"). These captives and others of analogous morphology were distinguished as "tsalim barya" in contrast with the Afroasiatic-speaking nobles or "saba qayh" ("red men"). The earliest representation of this tradition dates from a seventh or eighth century BC inscription belonging to the <a href="D%CA%BFmt">Kingdom of Damat</a>.

In <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, the period of colonization resulted in many unions and marriages between <a href="European%20ethnic%20groups">European</a> men and <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> and <a href="Khoisan">Khoisan</a> women from various tribes, resulting in mixed-race children. As the European settlers acquired control of territory, they generally pushed the mixed-race and Bantu and Khoisan populations into second-class status. During the first half of the 20th century, the Afrikaaner-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: "Black", "White", "<a href="Asia">Asia</a>n" (mostly <a href="India">India</a>n), and "<a href="Coloured">Coloured</a>". The Coloured group included people of mixed Bantu, Khoisan, and European descent (with some <a href="Cape%20Malays">Malay</a> ancestry, especially in the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa. It imposed a system of legal racial segregation, a complex of laws known as <a href="History%20of%20South%20Africa%20in%20the%20apartheid%20era">apartheid</a>.

The <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the <a href="Population%20Registration%20Act">Population Registration Act</a> of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the "<a href="Pencil%20test%20%28South%20Africa%29">pencil test</a>" was used. A pencil was inserted into a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough to hold the pencil, rather than having it pass through, as it would with smoother hair. If so, the person was classified as Black. Such classifications sometimes divided families.

<a href="Sandra%20Laing">Sandra Laing</a> is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her <a href="Human%20skin%20colour">skin colour</a> and <a href="hair%23hair%20texture">hair texture</a>, although her parents could prove at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school. The officials' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film "<a href="Skin%20%282008%20film%29">Skin</a>", which won numerous awards.

During the apartheid era, those classed as "Coloured" were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as "Black". The government required that Blacks and Coloureds live in areas separate from Whites, creating large townships located away from the cities as areas for Blacks.

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a "Non-racial democracy". In an effort to redress past injustices, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a> policies for Blacks; under these they define "Black" people to include "Africans", "Coloureds" and "Asians". Some <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a> policies favor "Africans" over "Coloureds" in terms of qualifying for certain benefits. Some South Africans categorized as "African Black" say that "Coloureds" did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. "Coloured" South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying, "we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC (<a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a>)".

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that <a href="Chinese%20South%20Africans">Chinese South Africans</a> who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as "Black people," solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also "disadvantaged" by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify for such benefits.

Other than by appearance, "Coloureds" can usually be distinguished from "Blacks" by language. Most speak <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> or English as a <a href="first%20language">first language</a>, as opposed to <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a> such as <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a> or <a href="Xhosa%20language">Xhosa</a>. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> names.

Historians estimate that between the advent of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> in 650CE and the abolition of slavery in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> in the mid-20th century, 10 to 18 million Black Africans (known as the <a href="Zanj">Zanj</a>) were enslaved by Arab slave traders and transported to the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and neighboring countries. This number far exceeded the number of slaves who were taken to the Americas. Several factors affected the visibility of descendants of this diaspora in 21st-century Arab societies: The traders shipped more female slaves than males, as there was a demand for them to serve as <a href="concubines">concubines</a> in harems in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries. Male slaves were castrated in order to serve as harem guards. The death toll of Black African slaves from forced labor was high. The mixed-race children of female slaves and Arab owners were assimilated into the Arab owners' families under the <a href="patrilineal">patrilineal</a> <a href="kinship%20system">kinship system</a>. As a result, few distinctive Afro-Arab communities have survived in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and neighboring countries.

<a href="Human%20genetic%20clustering">Genetic studies</a> have found significant African female-mediated gene flow in Arab communities in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and neighboring countries, with an average of 38% of maternal lineages in Yemen are of direct African descent, 16% in Oman-Qatar, and 10% in Saudi Arabia-United Arab Emirates.

Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq, with a reported 1.2 million black people, and they attest to a history of discrimination. These descendants of the Zanj have sought minority status from the government, which would reserve some seats in Parliament for representatives of their population. According to Alamin M. Mazrui et al., generally in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and neighboring countries, most of those of visible African descent are still classified and identify as Arab, not black.

About 150,000 East African and black people live in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, amounting to just over 2% of the nation's population. The vast majority of these, some 120,000, are <a href="Beta%20Israel">Beta Israel</a>, most of whom are recent immigrants who came during the 1980s and 1990s from <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. In addition, Israel is home to over 5,000 members of the <a href="African%20Hebrew%20Israelites%20of%20Jerusalem">African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem</a> movement that are descendants of <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> who emigrated to Israel in the 20th century, and who reside mainly in a distinct neighborhood in the <a href="Negev">Negev</a> town of <a href="Dimona">Dimona</a>. Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel, most of them converts from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, there are around 60,000 non-Jewish African immigrants in Israel, some of whom have sought asylum. Most of the migrants are from communities in <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> and <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, particularly the <a href="Niger-Congo%20languages">Niger-Congo</a>-speaking <a href="Nuba%20peoples">Nuba</a> groups of the southern <a href="Nuba%20Mountains">Nuba Mountains</a>; some are illegal immigrants.

Beginning several centuries ago, during the period of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, tens of thousands of <a href="Zanj">Zanj</a> captives were brought by slave traders to plantations and agricultural areas situated between <a href="Antalya%20Province">Antalya</a> and <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> in present-day <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. Some of their descendants remained "in situ", and many migrated to larger cities and towns. Other black slaves were transported to <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, from where they or their descendants later reached the <a href="%C4%B0zmir">İzmir</a> area through the <a href="population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey">population exchange between Greece and Turkey</a> in 1923, or indirectly from <a href="Ayval%C4%B1k">Ayvalık</a> in pursuit of work.

The <a href="Siddi">Siddi</a> are an ethnic group inhabiting <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> whose members are descended from <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu peoples</a> from <a href="Southeast%20Africa">Southeast Africa</a> that were brought to the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> as slaves by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> merchants. Although it is commonly believed locally that "Siddi" derives from a word meaning "black", the term is actually derived from "<a href="Sayyid">Sayyid</a>", the title borne by the captains of the Arab vessels that first brought Siddi settlers to the area. In the <a href="Makran">Makran</a> strip of the <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> and <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Balochistan</a> provinces in southwestern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, these Bantu descendants are known as the Makrani. There was a brief "Black Power" movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry.

<a href="Negrito">Negrito</a>s are believed to have been the first inhabitants of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Once inhabiting Taiwan, Vietnam, and various other parts of Asia, they are now confined primarily to Thailand, the Malay Archipelago, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Negrito means "little black people" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> (negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro, i.e., "little black person"); it is what the Spaniards called the short-statured, <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> autochthones that they encountered in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Despite this, Negritos are never referred to as black today, and doing so would cause offense. The term "Negrito" itself has come under criticism in countries like Malaysia, where it is now interchangeable with the more acceptable <a href="Semang">Semang</a>, although this term actually refers to a specific group. The common Thai word for Negritos literally means "frizzy hair".

The term "<a href="Moors">Moors</a>" has been used in Europe in a broader, somewhat derogatory sense to refer to <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, especially those of <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a> or <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> descent, whether living in North Africa or Iberia. Moors were not a distinct or <a href="ethnonym">self-defined</a> people. Medieval and early modern Europeans applied the name to Muslim Arabs, Berbers, Black Africans and Europeans alike.

<a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, writing in the 7th century, claimed that the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word Maurus was derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "mauron", μαύρον, which is the Greek word for black. Indeed, by the time Isidore of Seville came to write his "Etymologies", the word Maurus or "Moor" had become an adjective in Latin, "for the Greeks call black, mauron".

<a href="Afro-Spaniard">Afro-Spaniard</a>s are <a href="Spanish%20people">Spanish nationals</a> of <a href="West%20Africa">West</a>/<a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>n descent. They today mainly come from <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Gambia">Gambia</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. Additionally, many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>. Today, there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>.

According to the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, at the 2001 census there were over a million black people in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>; 1% of the total population described themselves as "Black Caribbean", 0.8% as "Black African", and 0.2% as "Black other". Britain encouraged the immigration of workers from the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; the first symbolic movement was those who came on the ship the "<a href="Empire%20Windrush">Empire Windrush</a>". The preferred official <a href="umbrella%20term">umbrella term</a> is "black and minority ethnic" (BME), but sometimes the term "black" is used on its own, to express unified opposition to racism, as in the <a href="Southall%20Black%20Sisters">Southall Black Sisters</a>, which started with a mainly <a href="British%20Asian">British Asian</a> constituency, and the <a href="National%20Black%20Police%20Association%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Black Police Association</a>, which has a membership of "African, African-Caribbean and Asian origin".

While census collection of ethnic background is illegal in <a href="France">France</a>, it is estimated that there are about 2.5 – 5 million black people residing there.

Afro-Dutch are residents of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> who are of Black African or <a href="Afro-Caribbean">Afro-Caribbean</a> ancestry. They tend to be from the former and present Dutch overseas territories of <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a>, <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>, <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, <a href="Sint%20Maarten">Sint Maarten</a> and <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>. The Netherlands also has sizable <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>an and other African communities.

As African states <a href="Decolonization%20of%20Africa">became independent</a> in the 1960s, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> offered many of their citizens the chance to study in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Over a period of 40 years, about 400,000 African students from various countries moved to Russia to pursue higher studies, including many Black Africans. This extended beyond the Soviet Union to many countries of the <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a>.

Due to the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">slave trade</a> in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> that had flourished in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, the coastal town of <a href="Ulcinj">Ulcinj</a> in <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> had its own black community. As a consequence of the slave trade and <a href="privateer">privateer</a> activity, it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived. The <a href="Military%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Army</a> also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> during the <a href="Austro-Turkish%20War%20of%201716%E2%80%9318">Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18</a>.

<a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> have been referred to as "black people" in Australia since the <a href="History%20of%20Australia%20%281788%E2%80%931850%29">early days of European settlement</a>. While originally related to <a href="skin%20colour">skin colour</a>, the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Islander">Torres Strait Islander</a> <a href="ancestry">ancestry</a> in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation.

Being identified as either "black" or "white" in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one's employment and social prospects. Various state-based <a href="Aboriginal%20Protection%20Board">Aboriginal Protection Board</a>s were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents. Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour. The social position of mixed-race or "<a href="half-caste">half-caste</a>" individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Sir <a href="Walter%20Baldwin%20Spencer">Baldwin Spencer</a> states that:
After the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, however, it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population, and by 1930 fear of the "half-caste menace" undermining the <a href="White%20Australia%20Policy">White Australia</a> ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern. Dr. <a href="Cecil%20Cook%20%28Australia%29">Cecil Cook</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> <a href="Protector%20of%20Aborigines">Protector of Natives</a>, noted that:
The official policy became one of biological and <a href="cultural%20assimilation">cultural assimilation</a>: "Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture to half-castes and eventually the race will become white". This led to different treatment for "black" and "half-caste" individuals, with lighter-skinned individuals targeted for removal from their families to be raised as "white" people, restricted from speaking their native language and practising traditional customs, a process now known as the <a href="Stolen%20Generation">Stolen Generation</a>.
The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people. In <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201967%20%28Aboriginals%29">a 1967 referendum</a> over 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national <a href="census">census</a>. During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term "black" and use their ancestry as a source of pride. Activist <a href="Bob%20Maza">Bob Maza</a> said:
In 1978 Aboriginal writer <a href="Kevin%20Gilbert%20%28author%29">Kevin Gilbert</a> received the National pageRank.Book Council award for his book "Living Black: Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert", a collection of Aboriginal people's stories, and in 1998 was awarded (but refused to accept) the Human Rights Award for Literature for "Inside Black Australia", a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography. In contrast to previous definitions based solely on the degree of Aboriginal ancestry, in 1990 the Government changed the legal definition of Aboriginal to include any:

This nationwide acceptance and recognition of Aboriginal people led to a significant increase in the number of people self-identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. The <a href="reappropriation">reappropriation</a> of the term "black" with a positive and more inclusive meaning has resulted in its widespread use in mainstream Australian culture, including public media outlets, government agencies, and private companies. In 2012, a number of high-profile cases highlighted the legal and community attitude that identifying as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is not dependent on skin colour, with a well-known boxer <a href="Anthony%20Mundine">Anthony Mundine</a> being widely criticised for questioning the "blackness" of another boxer and journalist <a href="Andrew%20Bolt">Andrew Bolt</a> being successfully sued for publishing discriminatory comments about Aboriginals with light skin.

<a href="John%20Caesar">John Caesar</a>, nicknamed "Black Caesar", a <a href="Convicts%20in%20Australia">convict</a> and <a href="bushranger">bushranger</a> with parents born in an unknown area in Africa, was one of the first people of recent Black African ancestry to arrive in Australia.

At the 2006 Census, 248,605 residents declared that they were <a href="African%20Australian">born in Africa</a>. This figure pertains to all immigrants to Australia who were born in nations in Africa regardless of race, and includes <a href="White%20Africans%20of%20European%20ancestry">White Africans</a>.

There were eight principal areas used by Europeans to buy and ship slaves to the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. The number of enslaved people sold to the New World varied throughout the slave trade. As for the distribution of slaves from regions of activity, certain areas produced far more enslaved people than others. Between 1650 and 1900, 10.24 million enslaved West Africans arrived in the Americas from the following regions in the following proportions:

The variants "neger" and "negar", derive from the Spanish and Portuguese word (black), and from the now-pejorative French "nègre" (negro). Etymologically, "negro", "noir", "nègre", and "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>" ultimately derive from "nigrum", the stem of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> (black) (pronounced which, in every other <a href="grammatical%20case">grammatical case</a>, <a href="grammatical%20gender">grammatical gender</a>, and <a href="grammatical%20number">grammatical number</a> besides <a href="nominative%20case">nominative</a> masculine singular, is "nigr-", the "r" is <a href="Alveolar%20trill">trilled</a>).

In the <a href="Colonial%20America">Colonial America</a> of 1619, <a href="John%20Rolfe">John Rolfe</a> used "negars" in describing the <a href="Slavery">slaves</a> who were captured from West Africa and then shipped to the <a href="Virginia%20colony">Virginia colony</a>. Later <a href="American%20English">American English</a> spellings, "neger" and "neggar", prevailed in a northern colony, New York under the <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a>, and in metropolitan Philadelphia's <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>n and <a href="Pennsylvania%20Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> communities; the <a href="African%20Burial%20Ground">African Burial Ground</a> in New York City originally was known by the Dutch name "Begraafplaats van de Neger" (Cemetery of the Negro); an early US occurrence of "neger" in <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, dates from 1625. <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> also used the term "black" in his <a href="Notes%20on%20the%20State%20of%20Virginia">Notes on the State of Virginia</a> in allusion to the slave populations.

By the 1900s, "nigger" had become a pejorative word in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. In its stead, the term "<a href="colored">colored</a>" became the mainstream alternative to "<a href="negro">negro</a>" and its derived terms. After the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, the terms "colored" and "negro" gave way to "black". "Negro" had superseded "colored" as the most polite word for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> at a time when "black" was considered more offensive. This term was accepted as normal, including by people classified as Negroes, until the later <a href="Civil%20Rights">Civil Rights</a> movement in the late 1960s. One well-known example is the identification by Reverend <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> of his own race as "Negro" in his famous speech of 1963, <a href="I%20Have%20a%20Dream">I Have a Dream</a>. During the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some African-American leaders in the United States, notably <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, objected to the word "Negro" because they associated it with the long history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination that treated African Americans as second-class citizens, or worse. Malcolm X preferred "Black" to "Negro", but later gradually abandoned that as well for "Afro-American" after leaving the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a>.

Since the late 1960s, various other terms for African Americans have been more widespread in popular usage. Aside from "Black American", these include "Afro-American" (in use from the late 1960s to 1990) and "African American" (used in the United States to refer to Black Americans, people often referred to in the past as "American Negroes").

In the first 200 years that black people were in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, they primarily identified themselves by their specific <a href="ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa">ethnic group</a> (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as <a href="Ashanti%20people">Ashanti</a>, <a href="Igbo%20people">Igbo</a>, <a href="Kongo%20people">Bakongo</a>, or <a href="Wolof%20people">Wolof</a>. However, when the first captives were brought to <a href="the%20Americas">the Americas</a>, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> to <a href="Angola">Angola</a> and in some cases from the south-east coast such as <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>. A new "African-American" identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the <a href="Black%20church">Black church</a> and <a href="AAVE">Black English</a>. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group. By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.

The US racial or ethnic classification "black" refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including <a href="albinos">albinos</a>, if they are believed by others to have West African ancestry (in any discernible percentage), or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being "<a href="African%20American">African American</a>". As a result, in the United States the term "black people" is not an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American, with a family history associated with <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">institutionalized slavery</a>. Relatively dark-skinned people can be classified as <a href="White%20people">white</a> if they fulfill other social criteria of "whiteness", and relatively light-skinned people can be classified as black if they fulfill the social criteria for "blackness" in a particular setting.

In March 1807, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain</a>, which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">the transatlantic slave trade illegal</a>, as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term "African" became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared that the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon Black Americans to remove the title of "African" from their institutions and replace it with "<a href="Negro">Negro</a>" or "Colored American". A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. African Americans popularly used the terms "Negro" or "colored" for themselves until the late 1960s.

The term "black" was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma. In his 1963 "<a href="I%20Have%20a%20Dream">I Have a Dream</a>" speech, <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> uses the terms "negro" fifteen times and "black" four times. Each time he uses "black" it is in parallel construction with "white"; for example, "black men and white men".

With the successes of the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of "Negro", activists promoted the use of "black" as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term "<a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a>" by Kwame Toure (<a href="Stokely%20Carmichael">Stokely Carmichael</a>) and the popular singer <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>'s song "<a href="Say%20It%20Loud%20%E2%80%93%20I%27m%20Black%20and%20I%27m%20Proud">Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud</a>".

In 1988, the civil rights leader <a href="Jesse%20Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a> urged Americans to use instead the term "African American" because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which if any of the two terms is more appropriate. <a href="Maulana%20Karenga">Maulana Karenga</a> argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin. Others have argued that "black" is a better term because "African" suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones. Some surveys suggest that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for "African American" or "Black", although they have a slight preference for "black" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.

In the <a href="Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29">U.S. census race definitions</a>, Black and African Americans are citizens and residents of the United States with origins in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to the <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a>, the grouping includes individuals who self-identify as African American, as well as persons who emigrated from nations in the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa. The grouping is thus based on geography, and may contradict or misrepresent an individual's self-identification since not all immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa are "Black". The Census Bureau also notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.

According to US Census Bureau data, <a href="African%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">African immigrants</a> generally do not self-identify as African American. The overwhelming majority of African immigrants identify instead with their own respective ethnicities (~95%). Immigrants from some <a href="Afro-Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, <a href="Afro-Latin%20Americans">Central American</a> and <a href="Afro-Latin%20American">South American</a> nations and their descendants may or may not also self-identify with the term.

Recent surveys of African Americans using a genetic testing service have found varied ancestries which show different tendencies by region and sex of ancestors. These studies found that on average, African Americans have 73.2–80.9% <a href="West%20African%20people">West African</a>, 18–24% European, and 0.8–0.9% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> genetic heritage, with large variation between individuals.

From the late 19th century, the South used a <a href="colloquial">colloquial</a> term, the "<a href="one-drop%20rule">one-drop rule</a>", to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early 20th century. Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the 18th and 19th centuries before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. For instance, President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of "<a href="partus%20sequitur%20ventrem">partus sequitur ventrem</a>", which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside of the US, some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop "rule" applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure. One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community. Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the 19th century were multiracial, such as <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, <a href="Robert%20Purvis">Robert Purvis</a> and James Mercer Langston. They advocated equality for all.

The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream <a href="African-American%20culture">African-American culture</a>, politics, and values. To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation, culture and behavior. Blackness can be contrasted with "<a href="acting%20white">acting white</a>", where black Americans are said to behave with assumed characteristics of stereotypical white Americans with regard to <a href="fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="dialect">dialect</a>, taste in <a href="music">music</a>, and possibly, from the perspective of a significant number of black youth, academic achievement.

Due to the often political and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people. <a href="Toni%20Morrison">Toni Morrison</a> once described <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> as the first black <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, because, as she put it, he displayed "almost every trope of blackness". <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> was offended by the notion of Clinton as the first black president, noting, "Mr Clinton, according to Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning novelist, is our first black President, the first to come from the broken home, the alcoholic mother, the under-the-bridge shadows of our ranking systems. Thus, we may have lost the mystical power to divine diabolism, but we can still divine blackness by the following symptoms: broken homes, alcoholic mothers, under-the-bridge habits and (presumable from the rest of [Arthur] Miller's senescent musings) the tendency to sexual predation and to shameless perjury about same." Some black activists were also offended, claiming that Clinton used his knowledge of black culture to exploit black people for political gain as no other president had before, while not serving black interests. They cite the lack of action during the <a href="Rwandan%20Genocide">Rwandan Genocide</a> and his <a href="welfare%20reform">welfare reform</a>, which Larry Roberts said had led to the worst <a href="child%20poverty">child poverty</a> since the 1960s. Others cited that the number of black people in jail increased during his administration.

The question of blackness also arose in the Democrat <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 presidential campaign</a>. Commentators have questioned whether Obama, who was elected the first President with black ancestry, is "black enough", contending that his background is not typical because his mother was <a href="white%20American">white American</a>, and his father was a black <a href="Kenyan%20American">Kenyan immigrant</a>. Obama chose to identify as black and <a href="African-American">African-American</a>.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com reported on historic and <a href="DNA">DNA</a> research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of <a href="John%20Punch%20%28slave%29">John Punch</a>, considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> colony. An <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servant</a>, he was "bound for life" in 1640 after trying to escape. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working-class like them. Their <a href="multi-racial">multi-racial</a> children were free because they were born to free <a href="English%20people">English</a> women. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to "marry white"; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-18th century.

Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> during the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> from 1492 to 1888, with 11.5 million of those shipped to <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas, with 5.5 million African slaves imported, followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million, the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans, and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million. Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean. In addition to skin color, other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean. In South America and the Caribbean, classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables, especially in light of social conceptions of "<a href="blanqueamiento">blanqueamiento</a>" (<a href="racial%20whitening">racial whitening</a>) and related concepts.

The concept of race in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both of his or her parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between an individual of unmixed West African descent and a very light <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> individual, more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on various combinations of <a href="Human%20hair%20color">hair color</a>, <a href="Hair%23Hair%20Texture">hair texture</a>, <a href="eye%20color">eye color</a>, and <a href="Human%20skin%20color">skin color</a>. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. In Brazil, people are classified by appearance, not heredity.

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that achieving <a href="Social%20mobility">upward mobility</a> and education results in individuals being classified as a category of lighter skin. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that "<a href="Racial%20whitening">whitening</a>" of one's social status may be open to people of <a href="mixed%20race">mixed race</a>, a large part of the population known as "<a href="pardo">pardo</a>", but a person perceived as "preto" (black) will continue to be classified as black regardless of wealth or social status.

From the years 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million captives were forcibly shipped from West/Central Africa to Brazil; the territory received the highest number of slaves of any country in the Americas. Scholars estimate that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descended from these individuals. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, during the slavery period and after, the Portuguese colonial government and later Brazilian government did not pass formal anti-<a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> or segregation laws. As in other Latin American countries, intermarriage was prevalent during the colonial period and continued afterward. In addition, people of mixed race ("pardo") often tended to marry white spouses, and their descendants became accepted as white. As a result, some of the European descended population also has West African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the 20th century, in which Brazilians could choose from five color/ethnic categories with which they identified, 54% of individuals identified as white, 6.2% identified as black, and 39.5% identified as pardo (brown) — a broad multi-racial category, including tri-racial persons.

In the 19th century, a philosophy of <a href="racial%20whitening">racial whitening</a> emerged in Brazil, related to the assimilation of mixed-race people into the white population through intermarriage. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835, roughly 50% of the population was "preto" (black; most were <a href="Slavery%20in%20Latin%20America">enslaved</a>), a further 20% was "pardo" (brown), and 25% white, with the remainder <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a>. Some classified as pardo were tri-racial.

By the 2000 census, demographic changes including the end to slavery, immigration from Europe and Asia, assimilation of multiracial persons, and other factors resulted in a population in which 6.2% of the population identified as black, 40% as pardo, and 55% as white. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing. A 2007 genetic study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since 1822 and the end of the colonial period) African ancestry.

Because of the acceptance of <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a>, Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were racially mixed, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.

The philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn some criticism, based on economic issues. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white or predominantly European in ancestry. One-third of the population lives under the <a href="Poverty%20threshold">poverty line</a>, with blacks and other <a href="people%20of%20color">people of color</a> accounting for 70 percent of the poor.

In 2015 United States, African Americans, including multiracial people, earned 76.8% as much as white people. By contrast, black and mixed race Brazilians earned on average 58% as much as whites in 2014. Some have posited that the facts of lower socioeconomic status for people of color suggest that Brazil practices a kind of <a href="one-drop%20rule">one-drop rule</a>, or discrimination against people who are not visibly European in ancestry. The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and all people of color. Other social factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns of disadvantage for people of color.

Some commentators observe that the United States practice of <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregation</a> and <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a> in the South, and discrimination in many areas outside that region, forced many African Americans to unite in the civil rights struggle, whereas the fluid nature of race in Brazil has divided individuals of African descent between those with more or less ancestry and helped sustain an image of the country as an example of post-colonial harmony. This has hindered the development of a common identity among black Brazilians.

Though Brazilians of at least partial African heritage make up a large percentage of the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador, Bahia</a>, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its first black mayor in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2005.

Critics note that people of color have limited media visibility. The Brazilian media has been accused of hiding or overlooking the nation's Black, Indigenous, Multiracial and East Asian populations. For example, the <a href="telenovelas">telenovelas</a> or <a href="Soap%20Opera">soaps</a> are criticized for featuring actors who resemble <a href="northern%20Europe">northern Europe</a>ans rather than actors of the more prevalent <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>an features) and <a href="White%20people%23Brazil">light-skinned mulatto and mestizo</a> appearance. (Pardos may achieve "white" status if they have attained the middle-class or higher social status).

These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate for use of the Portuguese term "negro" to encompass all African-descended people, in order to stimulate a "black" consciousness and identity. This proposal has been criticized since the term <a href="pardo">pardo</a> is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people, such as <a href="caboclo">caboclo</a>s (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only people of partial African and European descent. Trying to identify this entire group as "black" would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other, equally valid, ancestries and cultures. It seems a one-drop rule in reverse.

Plague (disease)

Plague is an <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a> that is caused by the <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">bacterium</a> "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>". Depending on lung infection, or <a href="Sanitation">sanitary conditions</a>, plague can be spread in the air, by direct contact, or very rarely by contaminated undercooked food. The symptoms of plague depend on the concentrated areas of infection in each person: <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> in lymph nodes, <a href="septicemic%20plague">septicemic plague</a> in blood vessels, <a href="pneumonic%20plague">pneumonic plague</a> in lungs. It is treatable if detected early. Plague is still <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">relatively common</a> in some remote parts of the world.

Until June 2007, plague was one of the three epidemic diseases specifically reportable to the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (<a href="cholera">cholera</a> and <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> the other two). The bacterium is named after the French-Swiss bacteriologist <a href="Alexandre%20Yersin">Alexandre Yersin</a>.

Historically, what are thought to have been massive <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s of plague swept through <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> with very high <a href="death%20rate">death rate</a>s and causing major cultural changes. The largest of these were the <a href="Plague%20of%20Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> of 541–542, The <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> of the 1340s, continuing in the <a href="Second%20plague%20pandemic">Second plague pandemic</a> to break out at intervals, and the <a href="Third%20plague%20pandemic">Third plague pandemic</a> beginning in 1855 and considered inactive from 1959.

The epidemiological use of the term "plague" is currently applied to any severe <a href="bubo">bubo</a> inflammation resulting from an infection with "Y. pestis". Historically, the medical use of the term "plague" has been applied to <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a> infections in general. Plague is often synonymous with <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>, but this describes just one of its manifestations. Other names have been used to describe this disease, such as Black Plague and the Black Death; the latter is now used primarily by scholars to describe the second, and most devastating, pandemic of the disease. The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the word "plague" is believed to come from the Latin word "plāga" ("blow, wound") and "plangere" (“to strike, or to strike down”), cf. German "Plage" (“infestation”).
Transmission of "Y. pestis" to an uninfected individual is possible by any of the following means.
"Yersinia pestis" circulates in animal reservoirs, particularly in rodents, in the natural foci of infection found on all continents except Australia. The natural foci of plague are situated in a broad belt in the tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and the warmer parts of the temperate latitudes around the globe, between the parallels 55 degrees North and 40 degrees South.
Contrary to popular belief, rats did not directly start the spread of the bubonic plague. It is mainly a disease in the <a href="flea">flea</a>s ("<a href="Xenopsylla%20cheopis">Xenopsylla cheopis</a>") that infested the rats, making the rats themselves the first victims of the plague. Infection in a human occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has been infected by biting a rodent that itself has been infected by the bite of a flea carrying the disease. The bacteria multiply inside the flea, sticking together to form a plug that blocks its stomach and causes it to starve. The flea then bites a host and continues to feed, even though it cannot quell its hunger, and consequently the flea vomits blood tainted with the bacteria back into the bite wound. The bubonic plague bacterium then infects a new victim, and the flea eventually dies from starvation. Serious outbreaks of plague are usually started by other disease outbreaks in rodents, or a rise in the rodent population.

In 1894, two bacteriologists, <a href="Alexandre%20Emile%20John%20Yersin">Alexandre Yersin</a> of <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Kitasato%20Shibasabur%C5%8D">Kitasato Shibasaburō</a> of <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, independently isolated the bacterium in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> responsible for the <a href="Third%20plague%20pandemic">Third Pandemic</a>. Though both investigators reported their findings, a series of confusing and contradictory statements by Kitasato eventually led to the acceptance of Yersin as the primary discoverer of the organism. Yersin named it "Pasteurella pestis" in honor of the <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a>, where he worked, but in 1967 it was moved to a new genus, renamed "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>" in honor of Yersin. Yersin also noted that rats were affected by plague not only during plague epidemics but also often preceding such epidemics in humans, and that plague was regarded by many locals as a disease of rats: villagers in <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="India">India</a> asserted that, when large numbers of rats were found dead, plague outbreaks soon followed.

In 1898, the French scientist <a href="Paul-Louis%20Simond">Paul-Louis Simond</a> (who had also come to <a href="China">China</a> to battle the Third Pandemic) established the rat-flea <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a> that drives the disease. He had noted that persons who became ill did not have to be in close contact with each other to acquire the disease. In <a href="Yunnan%2C%20China">Yunnan, China</a>, inhabitants would flee from their homes as soon as they saw dead rats, and on the island of <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a> (<a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>), residents considered the handling of dead rats heightened the risks of developing plague. These observations led him to suspect that the flea might be an intermediary factor in the transmission of plague, since people acquired plague only if they were in contact with recently dead rats, who had died less than 24 hours before. In a now classic experiment, Simond demonstrated how a healthy rat died of plague, after infected fleas had jumped to it, from a rat which had recently died of the plague.

When a flea bites a human and contaminates the wound with regurgitated blood, the plague carrying bacteria are passed into the tissue. "Y. pestis" can reproduce inside cells, so even if <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosed</a>, they can still survive. Once in the body, the bacteria can enter the <a href="lymphatic%20system">lymphatic system</a>, which drains <a href="interstitial%20fluid">interstitial fluid</a>. Plague bacteria secrete several <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s, one of which is known to cause dangerous <a href="beta%20blocker">beta-adrenergic blockade</a>.

"Y. pestis" spreads through the <a href="lymphatic%20vessels">lymphatic vessels</a> of the infected human until it reaches a <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>, where it stimulates severe <a href="bleeding">haemorrhagic</a> <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> that causes the lymph nodes to expand. The swollen lymph nodes form the characteristic <a href="bubo">bubo</a>es associated with the disease.

If the lymph node is overwhelmed, the infection can pass into the bloodstream, causing "secondary septicemic plague" and if the lungs are seeded, it can cause "secondary pneumonic plague".

Lymphatics ultimately drain into the bloodstream, so the plague bacteria may enter the blood and travel to almost any part of the body. In <a href="septicemia">septicemic</a> plague, bacterial endotoxins cause <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a> (DIC), causing tiny clots throughout the body and possibly ischaemic necrosis (tissue death due to lack of circulation/perfusion to that tissue) from the clots. DIC results in depletion of the body's clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and hemoptysis/hematemesis (coughing up/ vomiting of blood). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites; these are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Untreated, septicemic plague is usually fatal. Early treatment with <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a> reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People who die from this form of plague often die on the same day symptoms first appear.

The <a href="pneumonia">pneumonic</a> form of plague arises from <a href="infection">infection</a> of the <a href="human%20lung">lungs</a>. It causes coughing and sneezing and thereby produces <a href="Airborne%20disease">airborne</a> droplets that contain <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l cells and are likely to infect anyone inhaling them. The <a href="incubation%20period">incubation period</a> for pneumonic plague is short, usually two to four days, but sometimes just a few hours. The initial signs are indistinguishable from several other respiratory illnesses; they include headache, weakness, and <a href="hemoptysis">hemoptysis</a> or <a href="hematemesis">hematemesis</a> (spitting or vomiting of blood). The course of the disease is rapid; unless diagnosed and treated soon enough, typically within a few hours, death may follow in one to six days; in untreated cases mortality is nearly 100%.

This is an uncommon form of plague that resembles <a href="tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a> found in cases of close contact of patients with other forms of plague.

This form of plague occurs when bacteria cross the <a href="blood-brain%20barrier">blood-brain barrier</a>, leading to infectious meningitis.

There are a few other rare manifestations of plague, including asymptomatic plague and abortive plague. "Cellulocutaneous plague" sometimes results in infection of the skin and soft tissue, often around the bite site of a flea.

Since human plague is rare in most parts of the world, routine vaccination is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with <a href="enzootic">enzootic</a> plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with "Y. pestis" organisms resistant to antimicrobials; (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with "Y. pestis"; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with enzootic plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).

A systematic review by the <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a> found no studies of sufficient quality to make any statement on the efficacy of the vaccine.

<a href="Waldemar%20Haffkine">Waldemar Haffkine</a>, a doctor who worked in Bombay, India, was the first to invent and test a <a href="plague%20vaccine">plague vaccine</a> against <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> in 1897.

If diagnosed in time the various forms of plague are usually highly responsive to antibiotic therapy. The antibiotics often used are <a href="streptomycin">streptomycin</a>, <a href="chloramphenicol">chloramphenicol</a> and <a href="tetracycline">tetracycline</a>. Amongst the newer generation of antibiotics, <a href="gentamicin">gentamicin</a> and <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> have proven effective in <a href="monotherapy">monotherapeutic</a> treatment of plague.

The plague bacterium could develop <a href="drug-resistance">drug-resistance</a> and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in 1995. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.

In 1994, there was a pneumonic plague epidemic in <a href="Surat">Surat</a>, <a href="India">India</a> that resulted in 52 deaths and in a large internal migration of about 300,000 residents, who fled fearing quarantine.

A combination of heavy monsoon rain and clogged sewers led to massive flooding which resulted in unhygienic conditions and a number of uncleared animal carcasses. It is believed that this situation precipitated the epidemic. There was widespread fear that the sudden rush of people from this area might spread the epidemic to other parts of India and the world, but that scenario was averted, probably as a result of effective public health response mounted by the Indian health authorities. Some countries, especially those in the nearby Gulf region, took the step of cancelling some flights and putting a pause on shipments from India.

Much like the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> that spread through medieval Europe, some questions still remain unanswered about the 1994 epidemic in Surat.

Initial questions about whether it was an epidemic of plague arose because the Indian health authorities were unable to culture "Yersinia pestis", but this could have been due to poor laboratory procedures. Yet several lines of evidence strongly suggest that it was a plague epidemic: blood tests for Yersinia were positive, a number of individuals showed antibodies against Yersinia and the clinical symptoms displayed by the affected were all consistent with the disease being plague.


<a href="Plasmid">Plasmid</a>s of "Y. pestis" have been detected in archaeological samples of the teeth of seven <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> individuals from 5000 years ago (3000 BC), in the <a href="Afanasievo">Afanasievo</a> culture in Siberia, the <a href="Corded%20Ware%20culture">Corded Ware culture</a> in Estonia, the <a href="Sintashta%20culture">Sintashta culture</a> in Russia, the <a href="Unetice%20culture">Unetice culture</a> in Poland and the <a href="Andronovo%20culture">Andronovo culture</a> in Siberia. "Y. pestis" existed over Eurasia during the Bronze Age. Estimates of the age of the <a href="Most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">Most recent common ancestor</a> of all "Y. pestis" is estimated at 5,783 years <a href="Before%20Present">Before Present</a>.

The "Yersinia" <a href="murine">murine</a> toxin ("ymt") allows the bacteria to infect fleas, which can then transmit bubonic plague. Early ancestral versions of "Y. pestis" did not have the "ymt" gene, which was only detected in a 951 <a href="Before%20Present">calibrated BC</a> sample.

The <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna letters</a> and the Plague Prayers of <a href="Mursili%20II">Mursili II</a> describe an outbreak of a disease among the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>, though some modern sources say it may be <a href="Tularemia">Tularemia</a>. The <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">First pageRank.Book of Samuel</a> describes a possible plague outbreak in <a href="Philistia">Philistia</a>, and the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> version says it was caused by a "ravaging of mice".

In the second year of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> (430 BC), <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a> described an epidemic disease which was said to have begun in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, passed through <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, then come to the Greek world. In the <a href="Plague%20of%20Athens">Plague of Athens</a>, the city lost possibly one third of its population, including <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a>. Modern historians disagree on whether the plague was a critical factor in the loss of the war. Although this epidemic has long been considered an outbreak of plague, many modern scholars believe that <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, or <a href="measles">measles</a> may better fit the surviving descriptions. A recent study of DNA found in the dental pulp of plague victims suggests that <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> was actually responsible.

In the first century AD, <a href="Rufus%20of%20Ephesus">Rufus of Ephesus</a>, a Greek anatomist, refers to an outbreak of plague in <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. He records that Alexandrian doctors named Dioscorides and Posidonius described symptoms including acute fever, pain, agitation, and delirium. Buboes—large, hard, and non-suppurating—developed behind the knees, around the elbows, and "in the usual places." The death toll of those infected was very high. Rufus also wrote that similar buboes were reported by a Dionysius Curtus, who may have practiced medicine in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in the third century BC. If this is correct, the eastern <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> world may have been familiar with bubonic plague at that early date.

In the second century, the <a href="Antonine%20Plague">Antonine Plague</a>, named after <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>’ family name of Antoninus and also known as the Plague of Galen, who had first hand knowledge of the disease, may in fact have been <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. Galen was in Rome when it struck in 166 AD, and was also present in the winter of 168–69 during an outbreak among troops stationed at <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a>; he had experience with the epidemic, referring to it as very long lasting, and describes its symptoms and his treatment of it. Unfortunately, his references are scattered and brief. According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr "this pestilence must have raged with incredible fury; it carried off innumerable victims. The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflected upon it by the plague which visited it in the reign of M. Aurelius." The mortality rate of the plague was 7–10 percent; the outbreak in 165/6–168 would have caused approximately 3.5 to 5 million deaths. Otto Seek believes that over half the population of the empire perished. J. F. Gilliam believes that the Antonine plague probably caused more deaths than any other epidemic during the empire before the mid-3rd century.

Local outbreaks of the plague are grouped into three plague <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s, whereby the respective start and end dates and the assignment of some outbreaks to either pandemic are still subject to discussion. According to Joseph P. Byrne from <a href="Belmont%20University">Belmont University</a>, the pandemics were:
However, the late medieval Black Death is sometimes seen not as the start of the second, but as the end of the first pandemic – in that case, the second pandemic's start would be 1361; also vary the end dates of the second pandemic given in literature, e.g. ~1890 instead of ~1840.

The <a href="Plague%20of%20Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> in AD 541–542 is the first known attack on record, and marks the first firmly recorded pattern of bubonic plague. This disease is thought to have originated in China. It then spread to Africa from where the huge city of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> imported massive amounts of grain, mostly from Egypt, to feed its citizens. The grain ships were the source of contagion for the city, with massive public granaries nurturing the rat and flea population. At its peak, Procopius said the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople every day. The real number was more likely close to 5,000 a day. The plague ultimately killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants, and then continued to kill up to a quarter of the human population of the eastern Mediterranean.

In AD 588 a second major wave of plague spread through the Mediterranean into what is now France. It is estimated that the <a href="Plague%20of%20Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> killed as many as people across the world. It caused <a href="Medieval%20demography">Europe's population</a> to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700. It also may have contributed to the success of the <a href="Arab%20conquests">Arab conquests</a>. An outbreak of it in the AD 560s was described in AD 790 as causing "swellings in the glands ... in the manner of a nut or date" in the groin "and in other rather delicate places followed by an unbearable fever". While the swellings in this description have been identified by some as buboes, there is some contention as to whether the pandemic should be attributed to the bubonic plague, "Yersinia pestis", known in modern times.

From 1347 to 1351, the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>, a massive and deadly <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a> originating in China, spread along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> and swept through Asia, Europe and Africa. It may have reduced the world's population from to between 350 and . <a href="China">China</a> lost around half of its population, from around to around ; <a href="Europe">Europe</a> around of its population, from about to about ; and <a href="Africa">Africa</a> approximately of its population, from around to (mortality rates tended to be correlated with population density so Africa, being less dense overall, had the lowest death rate). This makes the Black Death the largest death toll from any known non-viral epidemic. Although accurate statistical data does not exist, it is thought that 1.4 million died in England ( of England's 4.2 million people), while an even higher percentage of Italy's population was likely wiped out. On the other hand, north-eastern Germany, Bohemia, Poland and Hungary are believed to have suffered less, and there are no estimates available for Russia or the Balkans. It is conceivable that Russia may not have been as affected due to its very cold climate and large size, hence often less close contact with the contagion.

The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. The was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–1363; 1374; 1400; 1438–1439; 1456–1457; 1464–1466; 1481–1485; 1500–1503; 1518–1531; 1544–1548; 1563–1566; 1573–1588; 1596–1599; 1602–1611; 1623–1640; 1644–1654; and 1664–1667; subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). According to Geoffrey Parker, "<a href="Early%20Modern%20France">France</a> alone lost almost a million people to plague in the epidemic of 1628–31."

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of pre-incident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–62, 1369, 1379–83, 1389–93, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–80 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuart</a> England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20London">Great Plague of London</a> in 1665.
In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, plague visited Paris for almost one year out of three. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease hit somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>'s population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. There were 22 outbreaks of plague in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the <a href="Italian%20Plague%20of%201629%E2%80%931631">Italian Plague of 1629–1631</a>, which is associated with troop movements during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, and the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Vienna">Great Plague of Vienna</a> in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died from 1348 to 1350. The last plague outbreak ravaged <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> in 1654.

In the first half of the 17th century, the <a href="Italian%20plague%20of%201629%E2%80%9331">Great Plague of Milan</a> claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1656, the plague killed about half of <a href="Naples">Naples</a>' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a>. The <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Seville">plague of 1649</a> probably reduced the population of <a href="Seville">Seville</a> by half. In 1709–1713, a <a href="The%20plague%20during%20the%20Great%20Northern%20War">plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War</a> (1700–1721, <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Sweden</a> v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, and claimed a third of <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>'s population. Western Europe's last major epidemic <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Marseille">occurred in 1720 in Marseilles</a>, in Central Europe the last major outbreaks happened during <a href="the%20plague%20during%20the%20Great%20Northern%20War">the plague during the Great Northern War</a>, and in Eastern Europe during the <a href="Russian%20plague%20of%201770%E2%80%9372">Russian plague of 1770–72</a>.

The Black Death ravaged much of the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a>. Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> lost 30,000–50,000 to it in 1620–1621, and again in 1654–1657, 1665, 1691, and 1740–1742. Plague remained a major event in <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, 37 larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, and 31 between 1751 and 1800. <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.

In the early 20th century, following the identification by Yersin and Kitasato of the plague bacterium that caused the late 19th and early 20th century Asian bubonic plague (the <a href="Third%20plague%20pandemic">Third Pandemic</a>), most scientists and historians came to believe that the Black Death was an incidence of this plague, with a strong presence of the more contagious pneumonic and septicemic varieties increasing the pace of infection, spreading the disease deep into inland areas of the continents.

Some modern researchers have argued that the disease was more likely to have been viral, pointing to the absence of rats from some parts of Europe that were badly affected and to the conviction of people at the time that the disease was spread by direct human contact. According to the accounts of the time the Black Death was extremely virulent, unlike the 19th and early 20th century bubonic plague. Samuel K. Cohn has made a comprehensive attempt to rebut the bubonic plague theory. Researchers have offered a mathematical model based on the changing demography of Europe from AD 1000 to 1800 demonstrating how plague epidemics, 1347 to 1670, could have provided the selection pressure that raised the frequency of a <a href="CCR5-D32">mutation</a> to the level seen today that prevent HIV from entering <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a> and CD4+ <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s that carry the mutation (the average frequency of this <a href="allele">allele</a> is 10% in European populations). It is suggested that the original single mutation appeared over 2,500 years ago and that persistent epidemics of a <a href="hemorrhagic%20fever">hemorrhagic fever</a> struck at the early classical civilizations.

However, there is evidence that two previously unknown <a href="clade">clade</a>s (variant strains) of "Y. pestis" were responsible for the Black Death. A multinational team conducted new surveys that used both ancient DNA analyses and protein-specific detection to find DNA and protein signatures specific for "Y. pestis" in human skeletons from widely distributed mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany,

The study also identified two previously unknown but related strains of "Y. pestis" that were associated with distinct medieval mass graves. These were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the present-day "Y. pestis" strains 'Orientalis' and 'Medievalis', suggesting that these variant strains (which are now presumed to be extinct) may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate that the first variant entered Europe through the port of <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three successive epidemics.

Surveys of plague pit remains from the Netherlands town of <a href="Bergen%20op%20Zoom">Bergen op Zoom</a> showed evidence of a second "Y. pestis" genotype which differed from that found in Britain and France and this second strain is now thought to have been responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350. This discovery implies that Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France c. AD 1349, and the researchers have suggested that a second wave of plague infection, distinct from that which occurred in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic</a> cities, or another site.

The <a href="Third%20plague%20pandemic">Third Pandemic</a> began in China's <a href="Yunnan%20province">Yunnan province</a> in 1855, spreading plague to all inhabited continents and ultimately killing more than people in <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="China">China</a> alone. Casualty patterns indicate that waves of this pandemic may have come from two different sources. The first was primarily <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic</a> and was carried around the world through ocean-going trade, transporting infected persons, rats, and cargoes harboring fleas. The second, more virulent strain was primarily <a href="Pneumonic%20plague">pneumonic</a> in character, with a strong person-to-person contagion. This strain was largely confined to <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. Researchers during the "Third Pandemic" identified plague vectors and the plague bacterium (see above), leading in time to modern treatment methods.

Plague occurred in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> in 1877–1889 in rural areas near the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. Efforts in hygiene and patient isolation reduced the spread of the disease, with approximately 420 deaths in the region. Significantly, the region of <a href="Vetlianka">Vetlianka</a> in this area is near a population of the <a href="Bobak%20Marmot">bobak marmot</a>, a small rodent considered a very dangerous plague reservoir. The last significant Russian outbreak of Plague was in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> in 1910 after sudden demand for marmot skins (a substitute for <a href="sable">sable</a>) increased the price by 400 percent. The traditional hunters would not hunt a sick Marmot and it was taboo to eat the fat from under the arm (the axillary <a href="lymph%20node">lymphatic gland</a> that often harboured the plague) so outbreaks tended to be confined to single individuals. The price increase, however, attracted thousands of Chinese hunters from Manchuria who not only caught the sick animals but also ate the fat, which was considered a delicacy. The plague spread from the hunting grounds to the terminus of the <a href="Chinese%20Eastern%20Railway">Chinese Eastern Railway</a> and then followed the track for 2,700 km. The plague lasted 7 months and killed 60,000 people.
The bubonic plague continued to circulate through different ports globally for the next fifty years; however, it was primarily found in Southeast Asia. An epidemic in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> in 1894 had particularly high death rates, 90%. As late as 1897, medical authorities in the European powers organized a conference in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, seeking ways to keep the plague out of Europe. <a href="Mumbai%20plague%20epidemic">Mumbai plague epidemic</a> struck the city of <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> (Mumbai) in 1896. The disease reached the <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">Territory of Hawaii</a> in December 1899, and the <a href="Board%20of%20Health%20of%20Hawaii">Board of Health's</a> decision to initiate controlled burns of select buildings in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>'s <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Honolulu">Chinatown</a> turned into an uncontrolled fire which led to the inadvertent burning of most of Chinatown on January 20, 1900. Shortly thereafter, plague reached the continental US, initiating the <a href="San%20Francisco%20plague%20of%201900%E2%80%931904">San Francisco plague of 1900–1904</a>. Plague persisted in Hawaii on the outer islands of Maui and Hawaii (The Big Island) until it was finally eradicated in 1959.

Although the outbreak that began in China in 1855 is conventionally known as the Third Pandemic (see above), it is unclear whether there have been fewer, or more, than three major outbreaks of bubonic plague. Most modern outbreaks of bubonic plague amongst humans have been preceded by a striking, high mortality amongst rats, yet this phenomenon is absent from descriptions of some earlier plagues, especially the Black Death. The buboes, or swellings in the groin, that are especially characteristic of bubonic plague, are a feature of other diseases as well.

Research done by a team of biologists from the Institute of Pasteur in Paris and Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz in Germany by analyzing the DNA and proteins from plague pits was published in October 2010, reported beyond doubt that all 'the three major plagues' were due to at least two previously unknown strains of "Yersinia pestis" and originated from China. A team of medical geneticists led by Mark Achtman of University College Cork in Ireland reconstructed a family tree of the bacterium and concluded in an online issue of Nature Genetics published on 31 October 2010 that all three of the great waves of plague originated from China.

Plague has a long history as a <a href="biological%20weapon">biological weapon</a>. Historical accounts from <a href="ancient%20China">ancient China</a> and <a href="medieval%20Europe">medieval Europe</a> detail the use of infected animal carcasses, such as cows or horses, and human carcasses, by the <a href="Xiongnu">Xiongnu</a>/<a href="Huns">Huns</a>, <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>, <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turks</a>, and other groups, to contaminate enemy water supplies. <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> General <a href="Huo%20Qubing">Huo Qubing</a> is recorded to have died of such a contamination while engaging in warfare against the Xiongnu. Plague victims were also reported to have been tossed by <a href="catapult">catapult</a> into cities under siege.

In 1347, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a> possession of <a href="Feodosia">Caffa</a>, a great trade emporium on the <a href="Crimean%20peninsula">Crimean peninsula</a>, came under siege by an army of <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a> warriors of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a> under the command of <a href="Janibeg">Janibeg</a>. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army was reportedly withering from the disease, they decided to use the infected corpses as a biological weapon. The corpses were catapulted over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, transferring the plague (<a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>) via their ships into the south of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>,
hence its rapid spread.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Japanese Army</a> developed weaponised plague, based on the breeding and release of large numbers of fleas. During the Japanese occupation of <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>, <a href="Unit%20731">Unit 731</a> deliberately infected <a href="Chinese%20people">Chinese</a>, Korean, and Manchurian <a href="civilian">civilian</a>s and <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> with the plague bacterium. These subjects, termed "maruta", or "logs", were then studied by <a href="dissection">dissection</a>, others by <a href="Human%20Subject%20Research%23Human%20vivisection">vivisection</a> while still conscious. Members of the unit such as <a href="Shiro%20Ishii">Shiro Ishii</a> were exonerated from the <a href="Tokyo%20tribunal">Tokyo tribunal</a> by <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> but 12 of them were prosecuted in the <a href="Khabarovsk%20War%20Crime%20Trials">Khabarovsk War Crime Trials</a> in 1949 during which some admitted having spread <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> within a 36-km radius around the city of <a href="Battle%20of%20Changde">Changde</a>.

Ishii innovated bombs containing live mice and fleas, with very small explosive loads, to deliver the weaponized microbes, overcoming the problem of the explosive killing the infected animal and insect by the use of a ceramic, rather than metal, casing for the warhead. While no records survive of the actual usage of the ceramic shells, prototypes exist and are believed to have been used in experiments during WWII.

After World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union developed means of weaponising pneumonic plague. Experiments included various delivery methods, vacuum drying, sizing the bacterium, developing strains resistant to antibiotics, combining the bacterium with other diseases (such as <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>), and genetic engineering. Scientists who worked in USSR bio-weapons programs have stated that the Soviet effort was formidable and that large stocks of weaponised plague bacteria were produced. Information on many of the Soviet projects is largely unavailable. Aerosolized pneumonic plague remains the most significant threat.

The plague can be easily treated with antibiotics, which some countries, such as the United States, have large supplies on hand if such an attack should occur, thus making the threat less severe.

Baudot code

The Baudot code, invented by <a href="%C3%89mile%20Baudot">Émile Baudot</a>, is a <a href="character%20encoding">character set</a> predating <a href="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</a> and <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>. It was the predecessor to the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2), the <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> code in use until the advent of ASCII. Each character in the alphabet is represented by a <a href="Asynchronous%20communication">series of five bits</a>, sent over a communication channel such as a telegraph wire or a radio signal. The <a href="symbol%20rate">symbol rate</a> measurement is known as <a href="baud">baud</a>, and is derived from the same name.

Technically, five-bit codes began in the 16th century, when <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> developed the cipher now called <a href="Bacon%27s%20cipher">Bacon's cipher</a>. However, this cipher is not a machine cipher and as such is not readily suitable for telecommunications.

Baudot invented his original code in 1870 and patented it in 1874. It was a 5-bit code, with equal on and off intervals, which allowed telegraph transmission of the Roman alphabet and punctuation and control signals. It was based on an earlier code developed by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Eduard%20Weber">Wilhelm Weber</a> in 1834. It was a <a href="Gray%20code">Gray code</a> (when vowels and consonants are sorted in their alphabetical order), nonetheless, the code by itself was not patented (only the machine) because French patent law does not allow concepts to be patented.

Baudot's original code was adapted to be sent from a manual keyboard, and no teleprinter equipment was ever constructed that used it in its original form. The code was entered on a keyboard which had just five piano type keys, operated with two fingers of the left hand and three fingers of the right hand. Once the keys had been pressed they were locked down until mechanical contacts in a distributor unit passed over the sector connected to that particular keyboard, when the keyboard was unlocked ready for the next character to be entered, with an audible click (known as the "cadence signal") to warn the operator. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.

The table on the right "shows the allocation of the Baudot code which was employed in the <a href="General%20Post%20Office%23New%20communication%20systems">British Post Office</a> for continental and inland services. It will be observed that a number of characters in the continental code are replaced by fractionals in the inland code. Code elements 1, 2 and 3 are transmitted by keys 1, 2 and 3, and these are operated by the first three fingers of the right hand. Code elements 4 and 5 are transmitted by keys 4 and 5, and these are operated by the first two fingers of the left hand."

Baudot's code became known as International Telegraph Alphabet No. 1 (ITA1), and is no longer used.

In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by <a href="Donald%20Murray%20%28inventor%29">Donald Murray</a> (1865–1945), prompted by his development of a typewriter-like keyboard. The Murray system employed an intermediate step, a keyboard perforator, which allowed an operator to punch a paper tape, and a tape transmitter for sending the message from the <a href="punched%20tape">punched tape</a>. At the receiving end of the line, a printing mechanism would print on a paper tape, and/or a reperforator could be used to make a perforated copy of the message. As there was no longer a connection between the operator's hand movement and the bits transmitted, there was no concern about arranging the code to minimize operator fatigue, and instead Murray designed the code to minimize wear on the machinery, assigning the code combinations with the fewest punched holes to the most <a href="letter%20frequencies">frequently used characters</a>.

For example, the one-hole letters are E and T. The ten two-hole letters are AOINSHRDLZ, very similar to the "<a href="Etaoin%20shrdlu">Etaoin shrdlu</a>" order used in <a href="Linotype%20machine">Linotype machine</a>s. Ten more letters have three holes, and the four-hole letters are VXKQ.

The Murray code also introduced what became known as "format effectors" or "<a href="control%20character">control character</a>s" the <a href="Carriage%20return">CR</a> (Carriage Return) and <a href="Newline">LF</a> (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or end of messages or between them, allowing easy separation of distinct messages (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission of a message was terminated).

Early <a href="Creed%20%26amp%3B%20Company">British Creed</a> machines used the Murray system.

Murray's code was adopted by <a href="Western%20Union">Western Union</a> which used it until the 1950s, with a few changes that consisted of omitting some characters and adding more control codes. An explicit SPC (space) character was introduced, in place of the BLANK/NULL, and a new <a href="Bell%20character">BEL</a> code rang a bell or otherwise produced an audible signal at the receiver. Additionally, the WRU or "Who aRe yoU?" code was introduced, which caused a receiving machine to send an identification stream back to the sender.

In 1924, the <a href="CCITT">CCITT</a> introduced the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code as an international standard, which was based on the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the <a href="American%20Teletypewriter%20code">American Teletypewriter code</a> (US TTY) which was the basis for 5-bit teletypewriter codes until the debut of 7-bit <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> in 1963.

Some code points (marked blue in the table) were reserved for national-specific usage.

The code position assigned to Null was in fact used only for the idle state of teleprinters. During long periods of idle time, the impulse rate was not synchronized between both devices (which could even be powered off or not permanently interconnected on commuted phone lines). To start a message it was first necessary to calibrate the impulse rate a sequence of regularly timed "mark" pulses (1) by group of five pulses, which could also be detected by simple passive electronic devices to turn on the teleprinter; this series of pulse was generating series of Erasure/Delete and also initializing the receiver state to the Letters shift mode, however the first pulse could be lost, so this power on procedure could then be terminated by a single Null immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete character. To preserve the synchronization between devices, the Null code could not be used arbitrarily in the middle of messages (this was an improvement to the initial Baudot system where spaces were not explicitly differentiated, so it was difficult to maintain the pulse counters for repeating spaces on teleprinters). But it was then possible to resynchronize devices at any time by sending a Null in the middle of a message (immediately followed by an Erasure/Delete/LS control if followed by a letter, or by a FS control if followed by a figure). Sending Null controls also did not cause the paper band to advance to the next row (as nothing was punched), so this saved precious lengths of punchable paper band. On the opposite the Erasure/Delete/LS control code was always punched and always shifted to the (initial) letters mode. According to some sources, the Null code point was reserved for country-internal usage only.

The Shift to Letters code (LS) is also usable as a way to cancel/delete text from a punched tape after it has been read, allowing a safe destruction of the message before recycling the punched band. For that function, it also plays the same role of filler as the Delete code in ASCII (and in other 7-bit or 8-bit encodings, including EBCDIC for punched cards). Once codes for a fragment text has been replaced by arbitrary number of LS codes, what follows is still preserved and decodable. It can also be used as an initiator to make sure that the decoding of the first code will not give a digit or another symbol from the figures page (because the Null code may be arbitrarily inserted near the end of a punch band or at start of it, and has to be ignored, whereas the Space code is significant in text).

The cells marked as reserved for extensions (using the LS code again from the letters shift page, just after a first LS code to shift from the figures page) has been defined to shift into a new mode: in this new mode, the letters page are containing lowercase letters only, but a third page of codes is still accessible for the uppercase letters, either temporarily for a single letter (encode LS before that letter), may be locked (with FS+LS) for an unlimited number of capital letters or digits and then unlocked to return to lowercase mode (with a single LS). The cell marked as "Reserved" is also usable (using the FS code from the figures shift page) to switch the page of figures (which normally contains digits and "national" lowercase letters or symbols) to a fourth page (where national letters are uppercased and other symbols may be encoded).

ITA2 is still used in <a href="telecommunications%20devices%20for%20the%20deaf">telecommunications devices for the deaf</a> (TDD), <a href="telex">telex</a>, and some <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> applications, such as <a href="radioteletype">radioteletype</a> ("RTTY"). ITA2 is also used in Enhanced Broadcast Solution (an early 21st century financial protocol specified by <a href="Deutsche%20B%C3%B6rse">Deutsche Börse</a>) to reduce the character encoding footprint.

Nearly all 20th-century teleprinter equipment used Western Union's code, ITA2, or variants thereof. Radio amateurs casually call ITA2 and variants "Baudot" incorrectly, and even the <a href="American%20Radio%20Relay%20League">American Radio Relay League</a>'s Amateur Radio Handbook does so, though in more recent editions the tables of codes correctly identifies it as ITA2.

NOTE: This table presumes the space called "1" by Baudot and Murray is rightmost, and least significant. The way the transmitted bits were packed into larger codes varied by manufacturer; the most common solution allocates the bits from the least significant bit towards the most significant bit (leaving the three most significant bits of a byte unused).

In ITA2, characters are expressed using five bits. ITA2 uses two code sub-sets, the "letter shift" (LTRS), and the "figure shift" (FIGS). The FIGS character (11011) signals that the following characters are to be interpreted as being in the FIGS set, until this is reset by the LTRS (11111) character. In use, the LTRS or FIGS shift key is pressed and released, transmitting the corresponding shift character to the other machine. The desired letters or figures characters are then typed. Unlike a typewriter or modern computer keyboard the shift key isn't kept depressed whilst the corresponding characters are typed. "ENQuiry" will trigger the other machine's answerback. It means "Who are you?"

CR is <a href="carriage%20return">carriage return</a>, LF is <a href="line%20feed">line feed</a>, BEL is the <a href="bell%20character">bell character</a> which rang a small <a href="bell%20%28instrument%29">bell</a> (often used to alert operators to an incoming message), SP is space, and NUL is the <a href="null%20character">null character</a> (blank tape).

Note: the binary conversions of the codepoints are often shown in reverse order, depending on (presumably) from which side one views the paper tape. Note further that the <a href="control%20character">"control" characters</a> were chosen so that they were either symmetric or in useful pairs so that inserting a tape "upside down" did not result in problems for the equipment and the resulting printout could be deciphered. Thus FIGS (11011), LTRS (11111) and space (00100) are invariant, while CR (00010) and LF (01000), generally used as a pair, are treated the same regardless of order by page printers. LTRS could also be used to overpunch characters to be deleted on a paper tape (much like DEL in 7-bit <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>).

The sequence "<a href="RY%20%28test%20signal%29">RYRYRY...</a>" is often used in test messages, and at the start of every transmission. Since R is 01010 and Y is 10101, the sequence exercises much of a teleprinter's mechanical components at maximum stress. Also, at one time, fine-tuning of the receiver was done using two coloured lights (one for each tone). 'RYRYRY...' produced 0101010101..., which made the lights glow with equal brightness when the tuning was correct. This tuning sequence is only useful when ITA2 is used with two-tone <a href="Frequency-shift%20keying">FSK</a> modulation, such as is commonly seen in <a href="radioteletype">radioteletype</a> (RTTY) usage.

US implementations of Baudot code may differ in the addition of a few characters, such as #, & on the FIGS layer.

The Russian version of Baudot code (<a href="MTK-2">MTK-2</a>) used three shift modes; the <a href="Cyrillic%20letter">Cyrillic letter</a> mode was activated by the character (00000). Because of the larger number of characters in the Cyrillic alphabet, the characters <a href="%21">!</a>, <a href="Ampersand">&</a>, <a href="Pound%20sign">£</a> were omitted and replaced by Cyrillics, and <a href="Bell%20character">BEL</a> has the same code as Cyrillic letter Ю.

As of 2015, Bostik was manufacturing around 100 tonnes of Blu Tack weekly at its <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> factory.

Blu Tack was originally developed in 1969 as an accidental by-product of an attempt to develop a new sealant using chalk powder, rubber and oil. The name of the inventor is unknown. Originally Blu-Tack was white, but consumer research showed fears that children may mistake it for chewing gum, and a blue colouring was added.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in March 2008, 20,000 numbered packs of pink Blu-Tack were made available, to help raise money for Breast Cancer Campaign, with 10 pence from each pack going to the charity. The formulation was slightly altered to retain complete consistency with its blue counterpart. Since then, many coloured variations have been made, including red and white, yellow and a green <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> pack.

Similar products of various colours are made by many manufacturers, including <a href="Faber-Castell">Faber-Castell</a>'s "Tack-it", <a href="Henkel">Henkel</a>'s "Fun-Tak", <a href="UHU">UHU</a>'s "Poster Putty" and "Sticky Tack","Gummy Sticker" <a href="Pritt">Pritt</a>'s "Sticky Stuff" and <a href="Elmer%27s%20Products%2C%20Inc.">Elmer's</a> "Poster Tack".

Versions of the product are also sold under the generic names "adhesive putty" and "mounting putty". The <a href="generic%20trademark">generic trademark</a> or common name for mounting putty varies by region. It is known as "Patafix" in France, Italy and Portugal (a phonetic abbreviation for ', "fastening dough" in French), ' ("teacher's chewing gum") in Iceland, and ' ("attachment mass") or ' in Sweden.

Like all poster putties, Blu-Tack provides an alternative to the artist's traditional <a href="kneaded%20eraser">kneaded eraser</a>, having a superior grip and plasticity. Blu-Tack can be finely shaped and worked into even very small areas. Like kneaded erasers, it can be stretched and kneaded to freshen its working surfaces. One of the early adopters and staunch exponent of Blu-Tack's use as a kneadable eraser replacement is the UK artist Mike Sibley. Blu-Tack, especially if kept warm in the artist's free hand, is far more versatile than a kneadable eraser. It can, for example, remove or tonally adjust the top layer of graphite without affecting the underlying detailed layer. It also works with the lightest of touches, where kneadable erasers need some pressure to pick up graphite. A further benefit is that graphite removed by Blu-Tack is securely held and will not be reapplied during successive erasing.

Some scale model hobbyists use Blu-Tack as a masking medium for painting camouflage schemes, as it can be easily molded to any shape and will not react with or lift the underlying paint.

Blu-Tack is also used for sculpture. In 2007 artist Elizabeth Thompson created a sculpture of a house spider using Blu-Tack over a wire frame. It took around 4000 packs and was exhibited at London Zoo. Other artists have created works from the material including stop-motion animation.

Blu-Tack can be used as a <a href="Damping%20%28music%29">damping agent</a> for sound and vibration applications, due to its low amplitude response properties.

A small amount of Blu-Tack can be placed on the head of a screw to hold it onto a screwdriver.

Bacillus

Bacillus is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="gram-positive">gram-positive</a>, <a href="bacillus%20%28shape%29">rod-shaped</a> <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and a member of the phylum <a href="Firmicutes">Firmicutes</a>. "Bacillus" species can be <a href="obligate%20aerobe">obligate aerobe</a>s (oxygen reliant), or <a href="facultative%20anaerobes">facultative anaerobes</a> (having the ability to be aerobic or anaerobic). They will test positive for the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="catalase">catalase</a> when there has been oxygen used or present. Ubiquitous in nature, "Bacillus" includes both free-living (nonparasitic) and <a href="parasitic">parasitic</a> <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic species. Under stressful environmental conditions, the bacteria can produce oval <a href="endospore">endospore</a>s that are not true 'spores', but to which the bacteria can reduce themselves and remain in a dormant state for very long periods. These characteristics originally defined the genus, but not all such species are closely related, and many have been moved to other genera of the Firmicutes.

Many species of "Bacillus" can produce copious amounts of enzymes which are used in different industries. Some species can form intracellular inclusions of <a href="polyhydroxyalkanoates">polyhydroxyalkanoates</a> under certain adverse environmental conditions, as in a lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources.

"<a href="B.%20subtilis">B. subtilis</a>" has proved a valuable model for research. Other species of "Bacillus" are important pathogens, causing <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> and <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a>.

Many "Bacillus" species are able to <a href="secretion">secrete</a> large quantities of enzymes. "<a href="Bacillus%20amyloliquefaciens">Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</a>" is the source of a natural antibiotic protein <a href="barnase">barnase</a> (a <a href="ribonuclease">ribonuclease</a>), <a href="alpha%20amylase">alpha amylase</a> used in starch hydrolysis, the <a href="protease">protease</a> <a href="subtilisin">subtilisin</a> used with detergents, and the <a href="BamH1">BamH1</a> <a href="restriction%20enzyme">restriction enzyme</a> used in DNA research.

A portion of the "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>" genome was incorporated into corn (and cotton) crops. The resulting <a href="GMO">GMO</a>s are therefore resistant to some insect pests.

"<a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>" is one of the best understood prokaryotes, in terms of molecular and cellular biology. Its superb genetic amenability and relatively large size have provided the powerful tools required to investigate a bacterium from all possible aspects. Recent improvements in <a href="fluorescent%20microscopy">fluorescent microscopy</a> techniques have provided novel insight into the dynamic structure of a single cell organism. Research on "B. subtilis" has been at the forefront of bacterial molecular biology and cytology, and the organism is a model for differentiation, gene/protein regulation, and cell cycle events in bacteria.

"Bacillus" species are almost ubiquitous in nature, e.g. in soil, but also occur in extreme environments such as high pH ("<a href="Bacillus%20alcalophilus">B. alcalophilus</a>"), high temperature ("<a href="Bacillus%20thermophilus">B. thermophilus</a>"), or high salt ("<a href="Bacillus%20halodurans">B. halodurans</a>"). "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">B. thuringiensis</a>" produces a toxin that can kill insects and thus has been used as insecticide.

Two "Bacillus" species are considered medically significant: "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">B. anthracis</a>", which causes <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, and "<a href="Bacillus%20cereus">B. cereus</a>", which causes <a href="foodborne%20illness">food poisoning</a> similar to that caused by "<a href="Staphylococcus">Staphylococcus</a>". A third species, "<a href="B.%20thuringiensis">B. thuringiensis</a>", is an important <a href="insect">insect</a> pathogen, and is sometimes used to control insect pests. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> is "B. subtilis", an important <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>. It is also a notable food spoiler, causing ropiness in bread and related food. Some environmental and commercial strains of "<a href="Bacillus%20coagulans">B. coagulans</a>" may play a role in food spoilage of highly acidic, tomato-based products.

An easy way to isolate "Bacillus" species is by placing nonsterile soil in a <a href="test%20tube">test tube</a> with water, shaking, placing in melted <a href="mannitol%20salt%20agar">mannitol salt agar</a>, and incubating at room temperature for at least a day. Colonies are usually large, spreading, and irregularly shaped. Under the microscope, the "Bacillus" cells appear as rods, and a substantial portion of the cells usually contain oval <a href="endospore">endospore</a>s at one end, making it bulge.

The cell wall of "Bacillus" is a structure on the outside of the cell that forms the second barrier between the bacterium and the environment, and at the same time maintains the rod shape and withstands the pressure generated by the cell's <a href="turgor">turgor</a>. The cell wall is composed of <a href="teichoic%20acid">teichoic</a> and teichuronic acids. "B. subtilis" is the first bacterium for which the role of an <a href="actin">actin</a>-like <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a> in cell shape determination and <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> synthesis was identified, and for which the entire set of peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes was localised. The role of the cytoskeleton in shape generation and maintenance is important

The genus "Bacillus" was named in 1835 by <a href="Christian%20Gottfried%20Ehrenberg">Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg</a>, to contain rod-shaped (bacillus) bacteria. He had seven years earlier named the genus "<a href="Bacterium">Bacterium</a>". "Bacillus" was later amended by <a href="Ferdinand%20Cohn">Ferdinand Cohn</a> to further describe them as spore-forming, Gram-positive, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Like other genera associated with the early history of microbiology, such as "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" and "<a href="Vibrio">Vibrio</a>", the 266 species of "Bacillus" are ubiquitous. The genus has a very large <a href="ribosomal">ribosomal</a> <a href="16S%20ribosomal%20RNA">16S</a> diversity and is environmentally diverse.
Several studies have tried to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. The "Bacillus"-specific study with the most diversity covered is by Xu and Cote using 16S and the ITS regions, where they divide the genus into 10 groups, which includes the nested genera "<a href="Paenibacillus">Paenibacillus</a>, <a href="Brevibacillus">Brevibacillus</a>, <a href="Geobacillus">Geobacillus</a>, Marinibacillus" and "<a href="Virgibacillus">Virgibacillus</a>". However, the tree <a href="http%3A//www.arb-silva.de/fileadmin/silva_databases/living_tree/LTP_release_104/LTPs104_SSU_tree.pdf"></a> constructed by <a href="%27The%20All-Species%20Living%20Tree%27%20Project">the living tree project</a>, a collaboration between ARB-Silva and <a href="LPSN">LPSN</a> where a 16S (and 23S if available) tree of all validated species was constructed, the genus "Bacillus" contains a very large number of nested taxa and majorly in both 16S and 23S it is paraphyletic to the Lactobacillales ("Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Listeria", etc.), due to "<a href="Bacillus%20coahuilensis">Bacillus coahuilensis</a>" and others. A gene concatenation study found similar results to Xu and Cote, but with a much more limited number of species in terms of groups, but used "Listeria" as an outgroup, so in light of the ARB tree, it may be "inside-out".

One clade, formed by "B. anthracis", "B. cereus", "B. mycoides", "B. pseudomycoides", "B. thuringiensis", and "B. weihenstephanensis" under current classification standards, should be a single species (within 97% 16S identity), but due to medical reasons, they are considered separate species, an issue also present for four species of "<a href="Shigella">Shigella</a>" and "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>".
