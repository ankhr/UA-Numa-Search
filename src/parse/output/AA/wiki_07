Adelaide

Adelaide ( ) is the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20capital%20cities">capital</a> city of the state of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, and the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Australia%20by%20population">fifth-most populous city of Australia</a>. In June 2016, Adelaide had an estimated resident population of 1,326,354. South Australia, with a total of 1.7 million inhabitants, has the most centralised population of any state in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, with more than 75 percent of its people living in greater Adelaide, while the other population centres in the state are relatively small.

Adelaide is north of the <a href="Fleurieu%20Peninsula">Fleurieu Peninsula</a>, on the <a href="Adelaide%20Plains">Adelaide Plains</a> between the <a href="Gulf%20St%20Vincent">Gulf St Vincent</a> and the low-lying <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> which surround the city. Adelaide stretches from the coast to the foothills, and from <a href="Gawler">Gawler</a> at its northern extent to <a href="Sellicks%20Beach">Sellicks Beach</a> in the south.

Named in honour of <a href="Adelaide%20of%20Saxe-Meiningen">Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen</a>, <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a> to <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a>, the city was founded in 1836 as the <a href="new%20town">planned capital</a> for a freely-settled British province in Australia. <a href="William%20Light">Colonel William Light</a>, one of Adelaide's founding fathers, designed the city and chose its location close to the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a>, in the area originally inhabited by the <a href="Kaurna%20people">Kaurna people</a>. Light's design set out Adelaide in a <a href="grid%20plan">grid layout</a>, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by <a href="Adelaide%20Parklands">parklands</a>. Early Adelaide was shaped by prosperity and wealth—until the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, it was Australia's third-largest city and one of the few Australian cities to not have convict history. It has been noted for early examples of religious freedom, a commitment to political <a href="progressivism">progressivism</a> and civil liberties. It has been known as the "City of Churches" since the mid-19th century. The demonym "Adelaidean" is used in reference to the city and its residents. 

As South Australia's seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">city centre</a> along the cultural boulevard of <a href="North%20Terrace%2C%20Adelaide">North Terrace</a>, <a href="King%20William%20Street%2C%20Adelaide">King William Street</a> and in various districts of the metropolitan area. Today, Adelaide is noted for and sporting events, its food and wine, its long beachfronts, and its large defence and manufacturing sectors. It ranks highly in terms of liveability, being listed in the Top 10 of "<a href="The%20Economist%20Intelligence%20Unit">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>"s World's Most Liveable Cities index in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2015. It was also ranked the <a href="most%20liveable%20city">most liveable city</a> in Australia by the Property Council of Australia in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Prior to its proclamation as a British settlement in 1836, the area around Adelaide was inhabited by the indigenous <a href="Kaurna%20people">Kaurna</a> <a href="Australian%20Aborigine">Aboriginal</a> nation (pronounced "Garner").

Kaurna culture and language was almost completely destroyed within a few decades of the European settlement of South Australia in 1836. However, extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both language and culture.

South Australia was officially proclaimed as a British colony on 28 December 1836, near <a href="The%20Old%20Gum%20Tree">The Old Gum Tree</a> in what is now the suburb of <a href="Glenelg%20North%2C%20South%20Australia">Glenelg North</a>. The event is commemorated in South Australia as <a href="Proclamation%20Day">Proclamation Day</a>. The site of the colony's capital was surveyed and laid out by Colonel William Light, the first Surveyor-General of South Australia, through the design made by the architect <a href="George%20Strickland%20Kingston">George Strickland Kingston</a>.

Adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants, promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution, based upon the ideas of <a href="Edward%20Gibbon%20Wakefield">Edward Gibbon Wakefield</a>. Wakefield had read accounts of Australian settlement while in prison in London for attempting to abduct an heiress, and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour, due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals. Wakefield's idea was for the Government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen. Funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants, who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land. As a result of this policy, Adelaide does not share <a href="Convictism%20in%20Australia">the convict settlement history</a> of other Australian cities like <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> and <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>.

As it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime, no provision was made for a <a href="Prison">gaol</a> in Colonel Light's 1837 plan. However, by mid-1837 the "<a href="South%20Australian%20Register">South Australian Register</a>" was warning of escaped convicts from New South Wales and tenders for a temporary gaol were sought. Following a burglary, a murder, and two attempted murders in Adelaide during March 1838, Governor Hindmarsh created the South Australian Police Force (now named <a href="South%20Australia%20Police">South Australia Police</a>) in April 1838 under 21-year-old <a href="Henry%20Inman%20%28police%20commander%29">Henry Inman</a>. The first sheriff, Mr Samuel Smart, was wounded during a robbery, and on 2 May 1838 one of the offenders, Michael Magee, became the first person to be hanged in South Australia. William Baker Ashton was appointed governor of the temporary gaol in 1839, and in 1840 George Strickland Kingston was commissioned to design Adelaide's new gaol. Construction of <a href="Adelaide%20Gaol">Adelaide Gaol</a> commenced in 1841.

Adelaide's early history was wrought by economic uncertainty and questionable leadership. The first governor of South Australia, <a href="John%20Hindmarsh">John Hindmarsh</a>, clashed frequently with others, in particular the Resident Commissioner, <a href="James%20Hurtle%20Fisher">James Hurtle Fisher</a>. The rural area surrounding Adelaide was surveyed by Light in preparation to sell a total of over of land. Adelaide's early economy started to get on its feet in 1838 with the arrival of livestock from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Wool production provided an early basis for the South Australian economy. By 1860, wheat farms had been established from <a href="Encounter%20Bay">Encounter Bay</a> in the south to <a href="Clare%2C%20South%20Australia">Clare</a> in the north.

<a href="George%20Gawler">Governor Gawler</a> took over from Hindmarsh in late 1838 and, despite being under orders from the "Select Committee on South Australia" in Britain not to undertake any public works, promptly oversaw construction of a governor's house, the <a href="Adelaide%20Gaol">Adelaide Gaol</a>, police barracks, a hospital, a <a href="Customs%20House%20Port%20Adelaide">customs house</a> and a wharf at <a href="Port%20Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a>. Gawler was recalled and replaced by <a href="George%20Edward%20Grey">Governor Grey</a> in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in <a href="Glen%20Osmond%2C%20South%20Australia">Glen Osmond</a> that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.

Trade links with the rest of the Australian states were established with the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> being successfully navigated in 1853 by <a href="Francis%20Cadell%20%28explorer%29">Francis Cadell</a>, an Adelaide resident. South Australia became a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> in 1856 with the ratification of a new constitution by the British parliament. <a href="Secret%20ballot">Secret ballot</a>s were introduced, and a <a href="Bicameralism">bicameral</a> parliament was elected on 9 March 1857, by which time 109,917 people lived in the province.

In 1860 the <a href="Thorndon%20Park">Thorndon Park</a> reservoir was opened, finally providing an alternative water source to the now turbid River Torrens. Gas street lighting was implemented in 1867, the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> was founded in 1874, the <a href="South%20Australian%20Art%20Gallery">South Australian Art Gallery</a> opened in 1881 and the <a href="Happy%20Valley%20Reservoir">Happy Valley Reservoir</a> opened in 1896. In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia. Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at <a href="Broken%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Broken Hill</a> provided some relief. Only one year of deficit was recorded, but the price paid was retrenchments and lean public spending. Wine and copper were the only industries not to suffer a downturn.

Electric street lighting was introduced in 1900 and electric trams were transporting passengers in 1909. 28,000 men were sent to fight in World War I. Historian F.W. Crowley examined the reports of visitors in the early 20th century, noting that "many visitors to Adelaide admired the <a href="Light%27s%20Vision">foresighted planning</a> of its founders", as well as pondering on the riches of the young city. Adelaide enjoyed a post-war boom, entering a time of relative prosperity. Its population grew, and it became the 3rd most populous metropolitan area in the country—after Sydney and Melbourne. Its prosperity was short lived, with the return of droughts, having endured the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s, and later returning to fortune under strong government leadership. <a href="Secondary%20sector%20of%20industry">Secondary industries</a> helped reduce the state's dependence on <a href="primary%20sector%20of%20industry">primary industries</a>. World War II brought industrial stimulus and diversification to Adelaide under the <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20IV">Playford</a> Government, which advocated Adelaide as a safe place for manufacturing due to its less vulnerable location. Shipbuilding was expanded at the nearby port of <a href="Whyalla%2C%20South%20Australia">Whyalla</a>.

The South Australian Government in this period built on former wartime manufacturing industries. International manufacturers like General Motors <a href="Holden">Holden</a> and <a href="Chrysler%20Australia">Chrysler</a> made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an agricultural service centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from <a href="Mannum%2C%20South%20Australia">Mannum</a> brought <a href="River%20Murray">River Murray</a> water to Adelaide in 1954 and <a href="Adelaide%20International%20Airport">an airport</a> opened at <a href="West%20Beach%2C%20South%20Australia">West Beach</a> in 1955. <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a> and the <a href="Flinders%20Medical%20Centre">Flinders Medical Centre</a> were established in the 1960s at Bedford Park, south of the city. Today, Flinders Medical Centre is one of the largest teaching hospitals within the South Australia.

The <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Dunstan Governments</a> of the 1970s saw something of an Adelaide 'cultural revival', establishing a wide array of social reforms and overseeing the city becoming a centre of the arts, building upon the biennial "<a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20of%20Arts">Adelaide Festival of Arts</a>" which commenced in 1960. Adelaide hosted the <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> between 1985 and 1996 on a street circuit in the city's east parklands; it then moved to Melbourne in 1996. The 1991 <a href="State%20Bank%20of%20South%20Australia">State Bank</a> collapsed during the then economic recession, with its effects lasting until 2004, when ratings agency <a href="Standard%20%26amp%3B%20Poor%27s">Standard & Poor's</a> reinstated South Australia's AAA credit rating. Since 1999, the <a href="Clipsal%20500">Clipsal 500</a> <a href="Supercars%20Championship">Supercars</a> race has made use of sections of the former Formula One circuit. Adelaide's tallest building, built in 1988, was originally known as the State Bank Building. In 1991 it was renamed the Santos Building and in 2006 it was again renamed <a href="Westpac%20House">Westpac House</a>.

In the early years of the 21st century there was a significant increase in the State Government's spending on Adelaide's infrastructure. The <a href="Mike%20Rann">Rann Government</a> invested $535 million in a major upgrade of the Adelaide Oval to enable <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">AFL</a> to be played in the city centre and more than $2 billion to build a new <a href="Royal%20Adelaide%20Hospital">Royal Adelaide Hospital</a> on land adjacent to the Adelaide Railway Station. The Glenelg tramline was extended through the city to Hindmarsh and the suburban railway line extended south to Seaford.

Following a period of stagnancy in the 1990s and 2000s, Adelaide began several major developments and redevelopments. The Adelaide Convention Centre was redeveloped and expanded at a cost of $350 million beginning in 2012. Three historic buildings were adapted for modern use: the <a href="Torrens%20Building">Torrens Building</a> in Victoria Square as the Adelaide campus for Carnegie Mellon University, University College London and Torrens University; the Stock Exchange building as the Science Exchange of the Royal Institution Australia; and the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital as the Adelaide Studios of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Film%20Corporation">SA Film Corporation</a>. The government also invested more than $2 billion to build a <a href="desalination">desalination</a> plant, powered by renewable energy, as an 'insurance policy' against droughts affecting Adelaide's water supply. In the Arts the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival">Adelaide Festival</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Fringe%20Festival">Fringe</a> and <a href="Womadelaide">Womadelaide</a> became annual events.

Adelaide is north of the Fleurieu Peninsula, on the Adelaide Plains between the Gulf St Vincent and the low-lying Mount Lofty Ranges. The city stretches from the coast to the foothills, and from <a href="Gawler%2C%20South%20Australia">Gawler</a> at its northern extent to <a href="Sellicks%20Beach%2C%20South%20Australia">Sellicks Beach</a> in the south. According to the Regional Development Australia, an Australian government planning initiative, the "Adelaide Metropolitan Region" has a total land area of , while a more expansive definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines a "Greater Adelaide" statistical area totalling . The city sits at an average elevation of above sea level. <a href="Mount%20Lofty">Mount Lofty</a>, east of the Adelaide metropolitan region in the Adelaide Hills at an elevation of , is the tallest point of the city and in the state south of <a href="Burra%2C%20South%20Australia">Burra</a>.

Much of Adelaide was bushland before British settlement, with some variation – sandhills, swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast. The loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion. Where practical, the government has implemented programs to rebuild and vegetate sandhills at several of Adelaide's beachside suburbs. Much of the original vegetation has been cleared with what is left to be found in reserves such as the <a href="Cleland%20Conservation%20Park">Cleland Conservation Park</a> and <a href="Belair%20National%20Park">Belair National Park</a>. A number of creeks and rivers flow through the Adelaide region. The largest are the Torrens and <a href="Onkaparinga%20River%20National%20Park">Onkaparinga</a> catchments. Adelaide relies on its many reservoirs for water supply with the <a href="Happy%20Valley%20Reservoir">Happy Valley Reservoir</a> supplying around 40% and the much larger <a href="Mount%20Bold%20Reservoir">Mount Bold Reservoir</a> 10% of Adelaide's domestic requirements respectively.

Adelaide and its surrounding area is one of the most seismically active regions in Australia. On 1 March 1954 at 3:40 am Adelaide experienced its largest recorded earthquake to date, with the epicentre 12 km from the city centre at <a href="Darlington%2C%20South%20Australia">Darlington</a>, and a reported magnitude of 5.6. There have been smaller earthquakes in 2010, 2011 and 2014.

Adelaide is a planned city, designed by the first surveyor-general of South Australia, Colonel <a href="William%20Light">William Light</a>. His plan, now known as Light's Vision, arranged Adelaide in a grid, with in the <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">Adelaide city centre</a> and a ring of parks, known as the <a href="Adelaide%20Parklands">Adelaide Parklands</a>, surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there. Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.

The benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a> grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of <a href="ring%20road">ring road</a>s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The <a href="City%20Ring%20Route%2C%20Adelaide">inner ring route</a> (<a href="A21%20road%20%28Australia%29">A21</a>) borders the parklands, and the outer route (<a href="A3%20road%20%28South%20Australia%29">A3</a>/<a href="South%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">A13</a>/<a href="A16%20highway%20%28Australia%29">A16</a>/<a href="A17%20highway%20%28Australia%29">A17</a>) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) <a href="Grand%20Junction%20Road">Grand Junction Road</a>, Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, <a href="Portrush%20Road">Portrush Road</a>, <a href="Cross%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">Cross Road</a> and <a href="South%20Road%2C%20Adelaide">South Road</a>.

Suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and "country towns", as well as the satellite city of <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20South%20Australia">Elizabeth</a>, have been enveloped by its <a href="urban%20sprawl">suburban sprawl</a>. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Freeway">South Eastern Freeway</a> to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's <a href="City%20of%20Onkaparinga">South</a> led to the construction of the <a href="Southern%20Expressway%20%28Australia%29">Southern Expressway</a>.

New roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The <a href="O-Bahn%20Busway">O-Bahn Busway</a> is an example of a unique solution to <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Gully%2C%20South%20Australia">Tea Tree Gully's</a> transport woes in the 1980s. The development of the nearby suburb of <a href="Golden%20Grove%2C%20South%20Australia">Golden Grove</a> in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.

In the 1960s, a <a href="Metropolitan%20Adelaide%20Transport%20Study">Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study</a> Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">expressways</a> and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a> approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government elected under <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a> shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the <a href="Liberal%20party%20of%20Australia">Liberal party</a> won government and premier <a href="David%20Tonkin">David Tonkin</a> committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.

In 2008, the <a href="Government%20of%20South%20Australia">SA Government</a> announced plans for a network of <a href="transport-oriented%20development">transport-oriented development</a>s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a <a href="Clipsal%20site%20development">10 hectare industrial site</a> at <a href="Bowden%2C%20South%20Australia">Bowden</a> for $52.5 million as the first of these developments. The site covers 102,478 square metres, or about 10 hectares, and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the Adelaide to Outer Harbour railway line to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east.

Historically, Adelaide's suburban residential areas have been characterised by single-storey detached houses built on blocks. A relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.

There is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick, and to a lesser degree, stone, and/or stone-faced, single-storey detached houses. After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular. Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and colourbond corrugated (and other types of) iron have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of "double brick" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by "dwarf walls". Due to Adelaide's <a href="Shrink%E2%80%93swell%20capacity">reactive soils</a> (particularly Keswick Clay, black earth and some red-brown earth soils), since then houses have mainly been constructed of "<a href="brick%20veneer">brick veneer</a>" over a timber frame (and more recently, over a steel frame) on a concrete raft slab foundation. The use of precast concrete panels for floor and wall construction has also increased. In addition to this, a significant factor in Adelaide's suburban history is the role of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Housing%20Trust">South Australian Housing Trust</a>.

Adelaide has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Csa"), with warm to hot dry summers and mild short winters, with most <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a> falling in the winter months. Adelaide receives enough annual precipitation to avoid <a href="K%C3%B6ppen">Köppen</a>'s BSh (semi-arid climate) classification. Rainfall is unreliable, light and infrequent throughout summer. In contrast, the winter has fairly reliable rainfall with June being the wettest month of the year, averaging around 80 mm. <a href="Frosts">Frosts</a> are occasional, with the most notable occurrences in July 1908 and July 1982. Hail is also common in winter. Adelaide is a windy city—it experiences <a href="wind%20chill">wind chill</a> in winter, which makes the temperature <a href="apparent%20temperature">seem colder than it actually is</a>. Snowfall in the metropolitan area is extremely uncommon, although light and sporadic falls in the nearby hills and at <a href="Mount%20Lofty">Mount Lofty</a> occur during winter. Dewpoints in the summer typically range from .

The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from in August to in February.

Adelaide, as the capital of South Australia, is the seat of the <a href="Government%20of%20South%20Australia">Government of South Australia</a>. As Adelaide is South Australia's capital and most populous city, the State Government co-operates extensively with the <a href="City%20of%20Adelaide">City of Adelaide</a>. In 2006, the Ministry for the City of Adelaide was created to facilitate the state government's collaboration with the <a href="Adelaide%20City%20Council">Adelaide City Council</a> and the Lord Mayor to improve Adelaide's image. The state parliament's Capital City Committee is also involved in the governance of the City of Adelaide, being primarily concerned with the planning of Adelaide's urban development and growth.

The Adelaide metropolitan area is divided between eighteen <a href="Local%20Government%20Areas%20of%20South%20Australia">local government areas</a>, including, at its centre, the <a href="City%20of%20Adelaide">City of Adelaide</a>, which administers the <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">Adelaide city centre</a>, <a href="North%20Adelaide">North Adelaide</a>, and the surrounding <a href="Adelaide%20Parklands">Adelaide Parklands</a>. It is the oldest municipal authority in Australia and was established in 1840, when Adelaide and Australia's first mayor, <a href="James%20Hurtle%20Fisher">James Hurtle Fisher</a>, was elected. From 1919 onwards, the City has had a <a href="List%20of%20Mayors%20and%20Lord%20Mayors%20of%20Adelaide">Lord Mayor</a>, the current being Lord Mayor <a href="Martin%20Haese">Martin Haese</a>.

Compared with the four other major state capitals in Australia, Adelaide is growing at a much slower rate. In 2015, Adelaide had a metropolitan population of more than 1,316,779 making it Australia's fifth largest city. Some 77% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states.

Major areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as <a href="Mawson%20Lakes%2C%20South%20Australia">Mawson Lakes</a> and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, row terrace or town houses and 49,413 flats, units or apartments.

About one sixth (17.1%) of the population had university qualifications. The number of Adelaideans with vocational qualifications (such as tradespersons) fell from 62.1% of the labour force in the 1991 census to 52.4% in the 2001 census.

Overseas-born Adelaideans composed 29.8% of the total population.

The five largest groups of overseas-born were from UK (7.0%), Italy (1.6%), India (1.4%), China (1.3%) and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> (1.0%). The most-spoken languages other than <a href="Australian%20English">English</a> were Italian (2.6%), Greek (1.9%), <a href="Standard%20Mandarin">Standard Mandarin</a> (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.3%), and <a href="Cantonese">Cantonese</a> (0.7%).

Adelaide is ageing more rapidly than other Australian capital cities. More than a quarter (27.5%) of Adelaide's population is aged 55 years or older, in comparison to the national average of 25.6%. Adelaide has the lowest number of children (under-15-year-olds), who comprised 17.7% of the population, compared to the national average of 19.3%.

Adelaide was founded on a vision of religious tolerance which attracted a wide variety of religious practitioners. This led to it being known as "The City of Churches". However, approximately 28% of the population expressed no religious affiliation in the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 22.3%, making Adelaide one of the least religious cities in Australia.
Over half of the population of Adelaide identifies as Christian, with the largest denominations being <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia">Catholic</a> (21.3%), <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican</a> (12.6%), <a href="Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia">Uniting Church</a> (7.6%) and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> (3.5%).

The <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> community of the city dates back to 1840. Eight years later, 58 Jews lived in the city. The Jewish <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> was built in 1871, when 435 Jews lived in the city. Many Jews took part in the city councils, such as Judah Moss Solomon (1852–66) and others after him. Three Jews have been elected to the position of city mayor. In the 1960s, the Jewish population of Adelaide numbered about 1,200; in 2001, according to the Australian census, 979 persons declared themselves to be Jewish by religion. In 2011, over 1,000 Jews were living in the city, operating an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">orthodox</a> and a <a href="Reform%20Judaism">reform</a> school, in addition to a virtual Jewish museum.

The "<a href="Afghan%20%28Australia%29">Afghan</a>" community in Australia first became established in the 1860s when camels and their Pathan, Punjabi, Baluchi and Sindhi handlers began to be used to open up settlement in the arid interior of the continent. Until eventually superseded by the advent of the railways and later, motor vehicles, they played an invaluable economic and social role in transporting heavy loads of goods to, and products from, isolated settlements and mines. This role is acknowledged by the name of <a href="The%20Ghan">The Ghan</a>, the passenger train operating between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin. The <a href="Central%20Adelaide%20Mosque">Central Adelaide Mosque</a> is regarded as the oldest permanent mosque in Australia; however an earlier <a href="Marree%20Mosque">mosque at Marree</a> in northern South Australia, dating from 1861–62 and subsequently abandoned or demolished, has now been rebuilt.

South Australia's largest employment sector is health care and social assistance, surpassing manufacturing in SA as the largest employer since 2006–07. In 2009–10, manufacturing in SA had average annual employment of 83,700 persons compared with 103,300 for health care and social assistance. Health care and social assistance represented nearly 13% of the state average annual employment. The <a href="Adelaide%20Hills%20wine%20region">Adelaide Hills wine region</a> is an iconic and viable economic region for both the state and country in terms of wine production and sale. The 2014 vintage is reported as consisting of red grapes crushed valued at A$8,196,142 and white grapes crushed valued at $14,777,631.

The retail trade is the second largest employer in SA (2009–10), with 91,900 jobs, and 12 per cent of the state workforce.

Manufacturing, defence technology, high tech electronic systems and research, commodity export and corresponding service industries all play a role in the SA economy. Almost half of all cars produced in Australia are made in Adelaide at the <a href="General%20Motors%20Holden">General Motors Holden</a> plant in <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20South%20Australia">Elizabeth</a>.

The <a href="State%20Bank%20of%20South%20Australia">collapse of the State Bank in 1992</a> resulted in large levels of state public debt (as much as A$4 billion). The collapse meant that successive governments enacted lean budgets, cutting spending, which was a setback to the further economic development of the city and state. The debt has more recently been reduced with the State Government once again receiving a AAA+ Credit Rating.

The global media conglomerate <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a> was founded in, and until 2004 incorporated in, Adelaide and it is still considered its 'spiritual' home by <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>. Australia's largest oil company, <a href="Santos%20Limited">Santos</a>, prominent South Australian brewery, <a href="Coopers%20Brewery">Coopers</a>, and national retailer <a href="Harris%20Scarfe">Harris Scarfe</a> also call Adelaide their home.

Adelaide is home to a large proportion of Australia's defence industries, which contribute over A$1 billion to South Australia's Gross State Product. The principal government military research institution, the <a href="Defence%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation">Defence Science and Technology Organisation</a>, and other defence technology organisations such as <a href="BAE%20Systems%20Australia">BAE Systems Australia</a> and Lockheed Martin Australia, are north of Salisbury and west of Elizabeth in an area now called "Edinburgh Parks", adjacent to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Edinburgh">RAAF Base Edinburgh</a>.

Others, such as Saab Systems and Raytheon, are in or near <a href="Technology%20Park%2C%20Adelaide">Technology Park</a>. <a href="ASC%20Pty%20Ltd">ASC Pty Ltd</a>, based in the industrial suburb of <a href="Osborne%2C%20South%20Australia">Osborne</a>. South Australia was charged with constructing Australia's <a href="Collins%20class%20submarine">"Collins" class submarines</a> and more recently the A$6 billion contract to construct the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>'s new <a href="Hobart%20class%20destroyer">air-warfare destroyers</a>.

As of November 2015, Greater Adelaide had an unemployment rate of 7.4% with a youth unemployment rate of 15%.

The median weekly individual income for people aged 15 years and over was $447 per week in 2006, compared with $466 nationally. The median family income was $1,137 per week, compared with $1,171 nationally. Adelaide's housing and living costs are substantially lower than that of other Australian cities, with housing being notably cheaper. The median Adelaide house price is half that of Sydney and two-thirds that of Melbourne. The three-month trend unemployment rate to March 2007 was 6.2%. The Northern suburbs' unemployment rate is disproportionately higher than the other regions of Adelaide at 8.3%, while the East and South are lower than the Adelaide average at 4.9% and 5.0% respectively.

Over the decade March 2001 – March 2010, Metropolitan Adelaide median house prices approximately tripled. (approx. 285% – approx. 11%p.a. compounding)
In the 5 years March 2007 – March 2012, prices increased by approx. 27% – approx. 5%p.a. compounding. March 2012 - March 2017 saw a further increase of 19% - approx. 3.5%p.a. compounding. 

In summary:

Each quarter, <a href="The%20Alternative%20and%20Direct%20Investment%20Securities%20Association">The Alternative and Direct Investment Securities Association</a> (ADISA) publishes a list of median house sale prices by suburb and <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Australia">Local Government Area</a>. (Previously, this was done by REISA) Due to the small size of many of Adelaide's suburbs, the low volumes of sales in these suburbs, and (over time) the huge variations in the numbers of sales in a suburb in a quarter, statistical analysis of "the most expensive suburb" is unreliable; the suburbs appearing in the "top 10 most expensive suburbs this quarter" list is constantly varying. Quarterly Reports for the last two years can be found on the REISA website.

Education forms an increasingly important part of the city's economy, with the South Australian Government and educational institutions attempting to position Adelaide as "Australia's education hub" and marketing it as a "Learning City." The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 30,726 in 2015, of which 1,824 were secondary school students. In addition to the city's existing institutions, foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses in order to increase its attractiveness as an education hub. Adelaide is the birthplace of three Nobel laureates, <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Nobel%20laureates%23Australian%20laureates%20by%20birthplace">more than any other Australian city</a>: physicist <a href="William%20Lawrence%20Bragg">William Lawrence Bragg</a> and pathologists <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Robin%20Warren">Robin Warren</a>, all of whom completed secondary and tertiary education at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St Peter's College</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>.

At the level of primary and secondary education, there are two systems of school education. There is a public system operated by the South Australian Government and a private system of independent and <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic school</a>s. All schools provide education under the <a href="South%20Australian%20Certificate%20of%20Education">South Australian Certificate of Education</a> (SACE) or, to a lesser extent, the <a href="International%20Baccalaureate">International Baccalaureate</a> (IB), with Adelaide having the highest number of IB schools in Australia.

There are three public universities local to Adelaide, as well as one private university and three constituent colleges of foreign universities. <a href="Flinders%20University%20of%20South%20Australia">Flinders University of South Australia</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Australia">University of South Australia</a> and <a href="Torrens%20University%20Australia">Torrens University Australia</a>—part of the <a href="Laureate%20International%20Universities">Laureate International Universities</a> are based in Adelaide. The University of Adelaide was ranked in the top 150 universities worldwide. Flinders ranked in the top 250 and Uni SA in the top 300. Torrens University Australia is part of an international network of over 70 higher education institutions in more than 30 countries worldwide. The historic Torrens Building in <a href="Victoria%20Square%2C%20Adelaide">Victoria Square</a> houses <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="Heinz%20College%20Australia">Heinz College Australia</a>, <a href="Cranfield%20University">Cranfield University</a>'s <a href="Defence%20College%20of%20Management%20and%20Technology">Defence College of Management and Technology</a>, and <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a>'s School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and constitute the city's international university precinct.

The <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>, with 25,000 students, is Australia's third-oldest university and a member of the leading "<a href="Group%20of%20Eight%20%28Australian%20universities%29">Group of Eight</a>". It has five campuses throughout the state, including two in the city-centre, and a campus in Singapore. The <a href="University%20of%20South%20Australia">University of South Australia</a>, with 37,000 students, has two North Terrace campuses, three other campuses in the metropolitan area and campuses at <a href="Whyalla%2C%20South%20Australia">Whyalla</a> and <a href="Mount%20Gambier%2C%20South%20Australia">Mount Gambier</a>. The <a href="Flinders%20University%20of%20South%20Australia">Flinders University of South Australia</a>, with 21,809 students, is in the southern suburb of <a href="Bedford%20Park%2C%20South%20Australia">Bedford Park</a>, alongside the <a href="Flinders%20Medical%20Centre">Flinders Medical Centre</a>, and maintains a small city campus in Victoria Square. 

There are several South Australian <a href="TAFE%20South%20Australia">TAFE</a> (Technical and Further Education) campuses in the metropolitan area which provide a range of vocational education and training. The Adelaide College of the Arts, as a school of TAFE SA, provides nationally recognised training in visual and performing arts.

In addition to the universities, Adelaide is home to a number of research institutes, including the <a href="Royal%20Institution%20of%20Australia">Royal Institution of Australia</a>, established in 2009 as a counterpart to the two-hundred-year-old <a href="Royal%20Institution">Royal Institution</a> of Great Britain. Many of the organisations involved in research tend to be geographically clustered throughout the Adelaide metropolitan area:

While established as a British province, and very much English in terms of its culture, Adelaide attracted immigrants from other parts of Europe early on, including German and other European non-conformists escaping religious persecution. The first German Lutherans arrived in 1838 bringing with them the <a href="vine%20cuttings">vine cuttings</a> that they used to found the acclaimed wineries of the <a href="Barossa%20Valley">Barossa Valley</a>.

Adelaide's arts scene flourished in the 1960s and 1970s with the support of successive premiers from both major political parties. The renowned <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20of%20Arts">Adelaide Festival of Arts</a> and <a href="Adelaide%20Fringe%20Festival">Fringe Festival</a> were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20Centre">Adelaide Festival Centre</a> began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the <a href="South%20Australian%20Film%20Corporation">South Australian Film Corporation</a> and, in 1976, the <a href="State%20Opera%20of%20South%20Australia">State Opera of South Australia</a>.

Over time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the <a href="Adelaide%20Cabaret%20Festival">Adelaide Cabaret Festival</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Film%20Festival">Adelaide Film Festival</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20of%20Ideas">Adelaide Festival of Ideas</a>, <a href="Adelaide%20Writers%27%20Week">Adelaide Writers' Week</a>, and <a href="WOMADelaide">WOMADelaide</a>, all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include <a href="Feast%20Festival">FEAST</a> (a <a href="LGBT%20culture">queer culture</a> celebration), <a href="Tasting%20Australia">Tasting Australia</a> (a biennial food and wine affair), and the <a href="Royal%20Adelaide%20Show">Royal Adelaide Show</a> (an annual <a href="agricultural%20show">agricultural show</a> and <a href="state%20fair">state fair</a>).

The <a href="Foxtel">Foxtel</a> <a href="pay%20TV">pay TV</a> service is available as cable television in a few areas, and as satellite television to the entire metropolitan area. It is resold by a number of other brands, mostly telephone companies.

As part of a nationwide phase-out of <a href="analogue%20television">analogue television</a> in Australia, Adelaide's analogue television service was shut down on 2 April 2013.

There are twenty radio stations that serve the metropolitan area, as well as four community stations that serve only parts of the metropolitan area. Of the twenty full coverage stations, there are six commercial stations, six community stations, six national stations and two narrowcast stations.

The main sports played professionally in Adelaide are <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>, <a href="association%20football">association football</a> (soccer), <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="netball">netball</a>, and <a href="basketball">basketball</a>. Adelaide is the home of two <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> teams: the <a href="Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Adelaide Football Club</a> and <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide Football Club</a>, and one <a href="A-League">A-League</a> soccer team, <a href="Adelaide%20United">Adelaide United</a>. A local <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> league, the <a href="South%20Australian%20National%20Football%20League">SANFL</a>, is made up of ten teams from around Adelaide. The SANFL has been in operation since 1877 when it began as the South Australian Football Association (SAFL) before changing its name to the SANFL in 1927. The SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code played in Australia.
Adelaide has developed a strong culture of attracting crowds to major sporting events. Until the completion of the 2012–14 renovation and upgrade of the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, most large sporting events took place at either <a href="AAMI%20Stadium">AAMI Stadium</a> (the then home base of the <a href="Adelaide%20Crows">Adelaide Crows</a>, and the then <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide's</a> home game venue), or the historic <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, home of the <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">Southern Redbacks</a> and the <a href="Adelaide%20Strikers">Adelaide Strikers</a> cricket teams. Since completion of the upgrade, home games for Adelaide Crows & Port Adelaide now take place at Adelaide Oval.

Since 1884, <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> has also hosted an international cricket test every summer, along with a number of <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> cricket matches. <a href="Memorial%20Drive%20Park">Memorial Drive Park</a>, adjacent to the Adelaide Oval, used to host Davis Cup and other major tennis events, including the <a href="Australian%20Open">Australian Open</a> and (until 2009) the Adelaide International (now known as the <a href="Brisbane%20International">Brisbane International</a>). Adelaide's professional association football team, <a href="Adelaide%20United">Adelaide United</a>, play in the A-League. Founded in 2003, their home ground is <a href="Hindmarsh%20Stadium">Hindmarsh Stadium</a>, which has a capacity of 17,000 and is one of the few <a href="Soccer-specific%20stadium">purpose-built soccer stadia</a> in Australia.

For two years, 1997 and 1998, Adelaide was represented in Australia's top level <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, after the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> had played a single game per season at the Adelaide Oval for five years starting in 1991. The <a href="Adelaide%20Rams">Adelaide Rams</a> were formed and played in the breakaway <a href="Super%20League%20%28Australia%29">Super League</a> (SL) competition in <a href="1997%20Super%20League%20%28Australia%29%20season">1997</a> before moving to the new <a href="National%20Rugby%20League">National Rugby League</a> in <a href="1998%20NRL%20season">1998</a>. Initially playing at the Adelaide Oval, the club moved to the more suitable Hindmarsh Stadium late in the 1998 season. As part of a peace deal with the <a href="Australian%20Rugby%20League">Australian Rugby League</a> to end the <a href="Super%20League%20war">Super League war</a>, the club's owners <a href="News%20Limited">News Limited</a> (who were also owners of the SL) suddenly closed the club only weeks before the start of the <a href="1999%20NRL%20season">1999 season</a>.

Adelaide has two professional basketball teams, the men's team being the <a href="Adelaide%2036ers">Adelaide 36ers</a> who play in the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28Australasia%29">National Basketball League</a> (NBL) and the women's team, the <a href="Adelaide%20Lightning">Adelaide Lightning</a> who play in the <a href="Women%27s%20National%20Basketball%20League">Women's National Basketball League</a> (WNBL). Both teams play their home games at the <a href="Titanium%20Security%20Arena">Titanium Security Arena</a>. Adelaide has a professional <a href="netball">netball</a> team, the <a href="Adelaide%20Thunderbirds">Adelaide Thunderbirds</a>, who play in the national netball competition, the <a href="Suncorp%20Super%20Netball">Suncorp Super Netball</a> championship, with home games played at <a href="Priceline%20Stadium">Priceline Stadium</a>. The Thunderbirds occasionally play games or finals at the Titanium Security Arena, while international netball matches are usually played at the 10,500 seat Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Titanium Security Arena has a capacity of 8,000 in is the largest purpose built basketball stadium in Australia.

Since 1999 Adelaide and its surrounding areas has hosted the <a href="Tour%20Down%20Under">Tour Down Under</a> <a href="Bicycle%20racing">bicycle race</a>, organised and directed by Adelaide-based <a href="Mike%20Turtur">Mike Turtur</a>. Turtur won an <a href="Summer%20Olympics">Olympic</a> <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a> for Australia in the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%201984%20Summer%20Olympics">4000m Team pursuit</a> at the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Los Angeles Olympics</a>. The Tour Down Under is the largest cycling event outside Europe and was the first event outside Europe to be granted <a href="UCI%20ProTour">UCI ProTour</a> status. Adelaide maintains a franchise in the <a href="Australian%20Baseball%20League">Australian Baseball League</a>, the <a href="Adelaide%20Bite">Adelaide Bite</a>. They have been playing since 2009, and their home stadium (until 2016) was <a href="Norwood%20Oval">Norwood Oval</a>. From 2016 the team moved to the <a href="Diamond%20Sports%20Stadium">Diamond Sports Stadium</a> located near the <a href="Adelaide%20International%20Airport">Adelaide International Airport</a> due to renovations at Norwood. Their name stems from the local <a href="Great%20Australian%20Bight">Great Australian Bight</a>, and from the abundance of local <a href="Great%20White%20Shark">Great White Shark</a>s. Adelaide also has an Ice Hockey team, <a href="Adelaide%20Adrenaline">Adelaide Adrenaline</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Ice%20Hockey%20League">Australian Ice Hockey League</a> (AIHL). They were national champions in 2009 and play their games at the <a href="Ice%20Arena%20%28Adelaide%29">IceArenA</a>.

The <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> for World Championship <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> racing was hosted by Adelaide from 1985 to 1995 on the <a href="Adelaide%20Street%20Circuit">Adelaide Street Circuit</a> which was laid out in the city's East End as well as the eastern parklands including the <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Adelaide">Victoria Park Racecourse</a>. The Grand Prix became a source of pride and losing the event to Melbourne in a surprise announcement in mid-1993 left a void that has since been filled with the highly successful <a href="Adelaide%20500">Clipsal 500</a> for <a href="V8%20Supercar">V8 Supercar</a> racing, held on a modified version of the same street circuit. The Classic Adelaide, a <a href="rallying">rally</a> of classic sporting vehicles, is also held in the city and its surrounds.

Adelaide formerly had three horse racing venues. Victoria Park, <a href="Cheltenham%20Park%20Racecourse">Cheltenham Park Racecourse</a>, both of which have now closed, and <a href="Morphettville%20Racecourse">Morphettville Racecourse</a> which remains as the home of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Jockey%20Club">South Australian Jockey Club</a>. It also has <a href="Globe%20Derby%20Park%20%28harness%20racing%29">Globe Derby Park</a> for <a href="Harness%20racing">Harness racing</a> which opened in 1969 and by 1973 had become Adelaide's premier harness racing venue taking over from the <a href="Adelaide%20Showgrounds">Wayville Showgrounds</a>, as well as <a href="Greyhound%20Park">Greyhound Park</a> for <a href="greyhound%20racing">greyhound racing</a> which opened in 1972.

The <a href="World%20Solar%20Challenge">World Solar Challenge</a> race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations, although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning nine races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. Adelaide hosted the 2012 World Bowls Championships at Lockleys Bowling Club, becoming the third city in the world to have held the championships twice, having previously hosted the event in 1996.

<a href="Dirt%20track%20racing">Dirt track speedway</a> is also popular in Adelaide with three operating speedways. <a href="Adelaide%20Motorsport%20Park">Adelaide Motorsport Park</a>, located adjacent to the <a href="Adelaide%20International%20Raceway">Adelaide International Raceway</a> road racing circuit at <a href="Virginia%2C%20South%20Australia">Virginia</a> ( north of the city centre) has been in continuous operation since 1979 after the closure of the popular <a href="Rowley%20Park%20Speedway">Rowley Park Speedway</a>. <a href="Gillman%20Speedway">Gillman Speedway</a> located in the semi-industrial suburb of <a href="Gillman%2C%20South%20Australia">Gillman</a>, has been in operation since 1998 and caters to <a href="Motorcycle%20speedway">Motorcycle speedway</a> and <a href="Sidecar%20speedway">Sidecars</a>, while the <a href="Sidewinders%20Speedway">Sidewinders Speedway</a> located in <a href="Wingfield%2C%20South%20Australia">Wingfield</a> is also a motorcycle speedway dedicated to Under-16 riders and has been in operation since 1978.

Adelaide's two largest tertiary hospitals are the <a href="Royal%20Adelaide%20Hospital">Royal Adelaide Hospital</a> (RAH), a <a href="teaching%20hospital">teaching hospital</a> of the University of Adelaide (705 beds), and the <a href="Flinders%20Medical%20Centre">Flinders Medical Centre</a> (580 beds) in Bedford Park, a teaching hospital of Flinders University. Other major public hospitals in the Adelaide area are the <a href="Women%27s%20and%20Children%27s%20Hospital%2C%20Adelaide">Women's and Children's Hospital</a> (305 beds), on King William Road in North Adelaide; the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Hospital%2C%20Adelaide">Queen Elizabeth Hospital</a> (340 beds) in Woodville, the <a href="Repatriation%20General%20Hospital%2C%20Daw%20Park">Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park</a> (300 beds) in Daw Park, and the <a href="Lyell%20McEwin%20Hospital">Lyell McEwin Hospital</a> (198 beds) in Elizabeth. These hospitals are all teaching hospitals. Additional RAH campuses which specialise in specific patient services are in the suburbs of Adelaide – the Hampstead Rehabilitation Centre in <a href="Northfield%2C%20South%20Australia">Northfield</a>, and the <a href="Glenside%2C%20South%20Australia">Glenside</a> Campus Mental Health Service. Adelaide also hosts numerous private hospitals in the city centre and suburbs.

In June 2007 the State Government announced a series of overhauls to the health sector that would see a new hospital constructed on railyards at the west end of the city, to replace the Royal Adelaide Hospital at the east end of the city. The new 800-bed hospital has a cost of A$1.85 billion and was planned to be named the "Marjorie Jackson-Nelson Hospital" after the <a href="Marjorie%20Jackson">former Governor of South Australia</a>. However, in 2009, at the former governor's request, the state government chose to drop this name and instead transfer the Royal Adelaide Hospital name to the proposed facility. Construction started in June 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2016.

In addition, major upgrades were announced to see the Flinders Medical Centre become the primary centre for health care for the southern suburbs, and the <a href="Lyell%20McEwin%20Hospital">Lyell McEwin Hospital</a> in Elizabeth become the centre for the northern suburbs. The trio of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, the <a href="Modbury%20Hospital">Modbury Hospital</a> and the Noarlunga Hospital were to become specialist elective surgery centres. The Repatriation General Hospital was also to expand its range of speciality areas beyond veterans' health to incorporate stroke, orthopaedic rehabilitation and aged care. With the "Global Financial Crisis" of 2008, it remains to be seen if and how these initiatives will proceed.

The largest not-for-profit provider of community health care within Adelaide is the <a href="Royal%20District%20Nursing%20Service%20%28South%20Australia%29">Royal District Nursing Service (South Australia)</a> which provides out of hospital care and hospital avoidance care, which in turn eases pressure on the South Australia public hospital system.

Being centrally located on the Australian mainland, Adelaide forms a strategic transport hub for east-west and north-south routes. The city itself has a metropolitan-wide public transport system, which is managed by and known as the <a href="Adelaide%20Metro">Adelaide Metro</a>. The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the <a href="O-Bahn%20Busway">O-Bahn Busway</a>, <a href="Railways%20in%20Adelaide">metropolitan railways</a> (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-<a href="Glenelg%20Tram">Glenelg Tram</a>, which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of <a href="Hindmarsh%2C%20South%20Australia">Hindmarsh</a>. There are further plans to extend the tram to <a href="Port%20Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a> and <a href="Semaphore%2C%20South%20Australia">Semaphore</a>. A <a href="Central%20business%20district">CBD</a> tram loop too, is being considered and the latest <a href="Adelaide%20Airport">Adelaide Airport</a> master plan has also revealed a tram extension to the airport in the near future.

Road transport in Adelaide has historically been comparatively easier than many of the other Australian cities, with a well-defined city layout and wide multiple-lane roads from the beginning of its development. Historically, Adelaide was known as a "twenty-minute city", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.

The Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways. In order of construction, they are:

The Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, <a href="Adelaide%20Airport">Adelaide Airport</a> and <a href="Parafield%20Airport">Parafield Airport</a>. Adelaide Airport, in Adelaide's western suburbs, serves in excess of 8 million passengers annually. Parafield Airport, Adelaide's second airport north of the city centre, is used for small aircraft, pilot training and recreational aviation purposes. Parafield Airport served as Adelaide's main aerodrome until the opening of the Adelaide Airport in February 1955.

Adelaide's energy requirements were originally met by the <a href="Adelaide%20Electric%20Supply%20Company">Adelaide Electric Supply Company</a>, which was nationalised by the <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20IV">Playford</a> government in 1946, becoming the <a href="SA%20Power%20Networks">Electricity Trust of South Australia</a> (ETSA), now known as SA Power Networks. Despite significant public opposition and the Labor party's anti-privatisation stance which left the Liberal party one vote short of the numbers needed to pass the legislation, ETSA was privatised by the <a href="John%20Olsen">Olsen</a> Government in 1999 by way of a 200-year lease for the distribution network and the outright purchase of ETSA Power by the <a href="Cheung%20Kong%20Holdings">Cheung Kong Holdings</a> for $3.5 billion (11 times ETSA's annual earnings) after Labor MP <a href="Trevor%20Crothers">Trevor Crothers</a> resigned from the party and voted with the government. 

The electricity retail market was opened to competition in 2003 and although competition was expected to result in lower retail costs, prices increased by 23.7% in the market's first year. In 2004 the privatisation was deemed to be a failure with consumers paying 60% more for their power and with the state government estimated to lose $3 billion in power generation net income in the first ten years of privatisation. In 2012, the industry came under scrutiny for allegedly reducing supply by shutting down generators during periods of peak demand to force prices up. Increased media attention also revealed that in 2009 the state government had approved a 46% increase in retail prices to cover expected increases in the costs of generation while generation costs had in fact fallen 35% by 2012. These price increases and large subsidies have led to South Australia paying the highest retail price for electricity in the world.

SA Power Networks now distributes electricity from transmission companies to end users. Privatisation led to competition from a variety of companies who now separately provide for the generation, transmission, distribution and retail sales of gas and electricity. Some of the major companies are: <a href="TRUenergy">TRUenergy</a>, which generates electricity; <a href="ElectraNet">ElectraNet</a>, which transmits electricity from the generators to the distribution network, <a href="Lumo%20Energy">Lumo Energy</a> and <a href="AGL%20Energy">AGL Energy</a>, which retails gas and electricity. Substantial investment has been made in maintenance and reinforcement of the electricity supply network to provide continued reliability of supply.

Adelaide derives most of its electricity from the <a href="Torrens%20Island%20Power%20Station">Torrens Island Power Station</a> gas-fired plant operated by <a href="AGL%20Energy">AGL Energy</a> and the <a href="Pelican%20Point%20Power%20Station">Pelican Point Power Station</a>, along with wind power and connections to the national grid. Gas is supplied from the <a href="Moomba%2C%20South%20Australia">Moomba</a> Gas Processing Plant in the <a href="Cooper%20Basin">Cooper Basin</a> via the <a href="Moomba%20Adelaide%20Pipeline%20System">Moomba Adelaide Pipeline System</a> and the <a href="SEAGas%20pipeline">SEAGas pipeline</a> from Victoria. South Australia generates 18% of its electricity from <a href="wind%20power">wind power</a>, and has 51% of the installed capacity of wind generators in Australia.

Adelaide's water supply is gained from its reservoirs: <a href="Mount%20Bold%20Reservoir">Mount Bold</a>, <a href="Happy%20Valley%20Reservoir">Happy Valley</a>, <a href="Myponga%20Reservoir">Myponga</a>, <a href="Millbrook%20Reservoir">Millbrook</a>, <a href="Hope%20Valley%20Reservoir">Hope Valley</a>, <a href="Little%20Para%20Reservoir">Little Para</a> and <a href="South%20Para%20Reservoir">South Para</a>. The yield from these reservoir catchments can be as little as 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is met by the pumping of water from the <a href="River%20Murray">River Murray</a>. A <a href="Adelaide%20Desalination%20Plant">sea water desalination plant</a> capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) was commissioned in 2013. The provision of water services is by the government-owned <a href="SA%20Water">SA Water</a>.

Alan Garner

Alan Garner <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> (born 17 October 1934) is an English novelist best known for his <a href="children%27s%20fantasy">children's fantasy</a> novels and his retellings of traditional British folk tales. Much of his work is firmly rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>, being set in the region and making use of the native <a href="Cheshire%20dialect">Cheshire dialect</a>.

Born in <a href="Congleton">Congleton</a>, Garner grew up around the nearby town of <a href="Alderley%20Edge">Alderley Edge</a>, and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as 'The Edge', where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. Studying at Manchester Grammar School and then briefly at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>, in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of Blackden, where he bought and renovated an Early Modern building known as Toad Hall. His first novel, "<a href="The%20Weirdstone%20of%20Brisingamen">The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</a>", was published in 1960. A children's fantasy novel set on the Edge, it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters. Garner completed a sequel, "<a href="The%20Moon%20of%20Gomrath">The Moon of Gomrath</a>" (1963), but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned. Instead he produced a string of further fantasy novels, "<a href="Elidor">Elidor</a>" (1965), "<a href="The%20Owl%20Service">The Owl Service</a>" (1967) and "<a href="Red%20Shift%20%28novel%29">Red Shift</a>" (1973).

Turning away from fantasy as a genre, Garner produced "<a href="The%20Stone%20Book%20Quartet">The Stone pageRank.Book Quartet</a>" (1979), a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family. He also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled "Alan Garner's Fairy Tales of Gold" (1979), "Alan Garner's pageRank.Book of British Fairy Tales" (1984) and "A Bag of Moonshine" (1986). In his subsequent novels, "<a href="Strandloper%20%28novel%29">Strandloper</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Thursbitch%20%28novel%29">Thursbitch</a>" (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, "<a href="Boneland">Boneland</a>".

Garner was born in the front room of his grandmother's house in <a href="Congleton">Congleton</a>, Cheshire, on 17 October 1934. He grew up nearby, in <a href="Alderley%20Edge">Alderley Edge</a>, a well-to-do village that had effectively become a suburb of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. His "rural working-class family", had been connected to Alderley Edge since at least the sixteenth century, and could be traced back to the death of William Garner in 1592. Garner claims that his family had passed on "a genuine oral tradition" involving folk tales about The Edge, which included a description of a king and his army of knights who slept under it, guarded by a wizard. In the mid-nineteenth century Alan's great-great grandfather Robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the face of a cliff next to a well, known locally at that time as the Wizard's Well.

Robert Garner and his other relatives had all been craftsmen, and, according to Garner, each successive generation had tried to "improve on, or do something different from, the previous generation". Garner's grandfather, Joseph Garner, "could read, but didn't and so was virtually unlettered". Instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge. Garner later remarked that as a result he was "aware of [the Edge's] magic" as a child, and he and his friends often played there. The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life, becoming, he explained, "deeply embedded in my psyche" and heavily influencing his later novels.

Garner faced several life-threatening childhood illnesses, which left him bed ridden for much of the time. He went to a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native <a href="Cheshire%20dialect">Cheshire dialect</a>; for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water. Garner then won a place at <a href="Manchester%20Grammar%20School">Manchester Grammar School</a>, where he received his secondary education; entry was means-tested, resulting in his school fees being waived. Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at <a href="Sprint%20%28running%29">sprinting</a>. He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>, who shared his fascination with the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Disney</a> film "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>". Garner was then conscripted into <a href="national%20service">national service</a>, serving for a time with the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> while posted to <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> in <a href="South%20East%20%28London%20sub%20region%29">Southeast London</a>.

At school, Garner had developed a keen interest in the work of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> and <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, as well as the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek language</a>. Thus, he decided to pursue the study of <a href="Classics">Classics</a> at <a href="Magdalen%20College%2C%20Oxford">Magdalen College, Oxford</a>, passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic. He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his "cultural background" and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who "could not cope with me, and I could not cope with" them. Looking back, he remarked, "I soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs". In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> in a performance of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>" where he co-starred alongside <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a> and where <a href="Kenneth%20Baker%2C%20Baron%20Baker%20of%20Dorking">Kenneth Baker</a> was the stage manager. In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956. He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained "a permanent strength through all my life".

Aged 22, Garner was out cycling when he came across a hand-painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in Toad Hall – a Late Medieval building situated in Blackden, seven miles from Alderley Edge – was on sale for £510. Although he personally could not afford it, he was lent the money by the local <a href="Oddfellow">Oddfellow</a> lodge, enabling him to purchase and move into the cottage in June 1957. In the late nineteenth century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers' cottages, but Garner was able to purchase the second for £150 about a year later; he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home.

Garner had begun writing his first novel, "<a href="The%20Weirdstone%20of%20Brisingamen">The Weirdstone of Brisingamen: A Tale of Alderley</a>", in September 1956. However it was while at Toad Hall that he finished the book. Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother's old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the "svart alfar", who dwell in the Edge's abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are massing at the Edge in search of the eponymous "weirdstone of Brisingamen". Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that "I couldn't write and teach; the energies were too similar", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.

Garner sent his debut novel to the publishing company <a href="William%20Collins%2C%20Sons%20and%20Co%20Ltd">Collins</a>, where it was picked up by the company's head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of <a href="J.R.R.%20Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" (1954–55). Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that "Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it." On its release in 1960, "The Weirdstone of Brisingamen" proved to be a critical and commercial success, later being described as "a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children." Garner himself however would later denounce this novel as "a fairly bad book" in 1968.

With his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a "hand to mouth" lifestyle on a "shoestring" budget. He also worked on a sequel to "The Weirdstone of Brisingamen", which would be known as "<a href="The%20Moon%20of%20Gomrath">The Moon of Gomrath</a>". "The Moon of Gomrath" also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the <a href="Brollachan">Brollachan</a> who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan's soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back. Critic Neil Philip characterised it as "an artistic advance" but "a less satisfying story". In a 1989 interview, Garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different. However "<a href="Boneland">Boneland</a>", the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.

In 1962 Garner began work on a <a href="radio%20play">radio play</a> named "Elidor", which would result in the completion of a novel of the same name. Set in contemporary Manchester, "Elidor" tells the story of four children who enter into a derelict Victorian church, in which they find a portal to the magical realm of Elidor. Here, they are entrusted by King Malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of the kingdom. Successfully doing so, the children return to Manchester with the treasures, but are pursued by the malevolent forces who need them to seal their victory.

Before writing "Elidor", Garner had seen a dinner service set which could be arranged to make pictures of either flowers or owls. Inspired by this design, he produced his fourth novel, "<a href="The%20Owl%20Service">The Owl Service</a>". The story was also heavily influenced by the Medieval Welsh tale of <a href="Math%20fab%20Mathonwy">Math fab Mathonwy</a> from, the "<a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>". "The Owl Service" was critically acclaimed, winning both the <a href="Carnegie%20Medal%20%28literary%20award%29">Carnegie Medal</a> and <a href="Guardian%20Children%27s%20Fiction%20Prize">Guardian Children's Fiction Prize</a>. It also sparked discussions among critics as to whether Garner should properly be considered a children's writer, given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership.

It took Garner six years to write his next novel, "<a href="Red%20Shift%20%28novel%29">Red Shift</a>". In this, he provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, and the third in the second century CE. Philip referred to it as "a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear".
Academic specialist in children's literature Maria Nikolajeva characterised "Red Shift" as "a difficult book" for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of "loneliness and failure to communicate". Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that "it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called "realistic" juvenile novels."

From 1976 to 1978, Garner published a series of four novellas, which have come to be collectively known as "<a href="The%20Stone%20Book">The Stone pageRank.Book</a>" quartet: "The Stone pageRank.Book", "Granny Reardun", "The Aimer Gate", and "Tom Fobble's Day". Each focused on a day in the life of a child in the Garner family, each from a different generation.
In a 1989 interview, Garner noted that although writing "The Stone pageRank.Book Quartet" had been "exhausting", it had been "the most rewarding of everything" he'd done to date. Philip described the quartet as "a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career".
Garner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading "<a href="Sir%20Gawain%20and%20the%20Green%20Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a>": the footnotes would not have been needed by his father.

In 1981, the literary critic Neil Philip published an analysis of Garner's novels as "A Fine Anger", which was based on his doctoral thesis, produced for the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> in 1980. In this study he noted that ""The Stone pageRank.Book" quartet marks a watershed in Garner's writing career, and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far."

In 1996, Garner's novel "<a href="Strandloper%20%28novel%29">Strandloper</a>" was published. His collection of essays and public talks, "The Voice That Thunders", contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In "The Voice That Thunders" he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded "Strandloper" to 'forsake "literature", and become instead a "popular" writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'. Garner feared that "making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death" and felt unable to comply.

Garner's novel, "<a href="Thursbitch">Thursbitch</a>", was published in 2003. Garner's novel, "Boneland", was published in 2012, nominally completing a trilogy begun some 50 years earlier with "<a href="The%20Weirdstone%20of%20Brisingamen">The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</a>".

With his first wife Anne Cook he had three children. In 1972 he married for a second time, this time to Griselda Greaves, a teacher and critic with whom he had two children. In a 2014 interview conducted with <a href="Mike%20Pitts">Mike Pitts</a> for "British Archaeology" magazine, Garner stated that "I don't have anything to do with the literary world. I avoid writers. I don't like them. Most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists."

Although Garner's early work is often labelled as "children's literature", Garner himself rejects such a description, informing one interviewer that "I certainly have never written for children" but that instead he has always written purely for himself. Neil Philip, in his critical study of Garner's work (1981), commented that up till that point, "Everything Alan Garner has published has been published for children", although he went on to relate that "It may be that Garner's is a case" where the division between children's and adult's literature is "meaningless" and that his fiction is instead "enjoyed by a type of person, no matter what their age."

Philip offered the opinion that the "essence of his work" was "the struggle to render the complex in simple, bare terms; to couch the abstract in the concrete and communicate it directly to the reader". He added that Garner's work is "intensely autobiographical, in both obvious and subtle ways". Highlighting Garner's use of mythological and folkloric sources, Philip stated that his work explores "the disjointed and troubled psychological and emotional landscape of the twentieth century through the symbolism of myth and folklore." He also expressed the opinion that "Time is Garner's most consistent theme".

The English author and academic <a href="Charles%20Butler%20%28author%29">Charles Butler</a> noted that Garner was attentive to the "geological, archaeological and cultural history of his settings, and careful to integrate his fiction with the physical reality beyond the page." As a part of this, Garner had included maps of Alderley Edge in both "The Weirdstone of Brisingamen" and "The Moon of Gomrath". Garner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books; writing in the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>" in 1968, Garner commented that in preparation for writing his book "Elidor":

In a paper published in the "<a href="Children%27s%20Literature%20Association%20Quarterly">Children's Literature Association Quarterly</a>", Maria Nikolajeva characterised Garner as "one of the most controversial" authors of modern children's literature.

In the fiftieth anniversary edition of "The Weirdstone of Brisingamen", published by <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a> in 2010, several notable British fantasy novelists praised Garner and his work. <a href="Susan%20Cooper">Susan Cooper</a> related that "The power and range of Alan Garner's astounding talent has grown with every book he's written", whilst <a href="David%20Almond">David Almond</a> called him one of Britain's "greatest writers" whose works "really matter". <a href="Philip%20Pullman">Philip Pullman</a>, the author of the "<a href="His%20Dark%20Materials">His Dark Materials</a>" trilogy, went further when he remarked that:

Another British fantasy writer, <a href="Neil%20Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>, claimed that "Garner's fiction is something special" in that it was "smart and challenging, based in the here and the now, in which real English places emerged from the shadows of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth." Praise also came from Nick Lake, the editorial director of <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a> Children's Books, who proclaimed that "Garner is, quite simply, one of the greatest and most influential writers this country has ever produced."

The biennial <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen%20Award">Hans Christian Andersen Award</a> conferred by the <a href="International%20Board%20on%20Books%20for%20Young%20People">International Board on Books for Young People</a> is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children's books. Garner was the sole runner-up for the writing award in 1978.

Garner was appointed <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) for services to literature in the 2001 <a href="British%20honours%20system">New Year's Honours list</a>. He received the <a href="British%20Fantasy%20Society">British Fantasy Society</a>'s occasional <a href="British%20Fantasy%20Awards">Karl Edward Wagner Award</a> in 2003 and the <a href="World%20Fantasy%20Award%20for%20Life%20Achievement">World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement</a> in 2012. In January 2011, the <a href="University%20of%20Warwick">University of Warwick</a> awarded the degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> (<a href="honoris%20causa">honoris causa</a>). On that occasion he gave a half-hour interview about his work.

He has been recognised several times for particular works.

<doc id="1158" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158" title="Algebraic number">
Algebraic number

An algebraic number is any <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a> that is a <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">root</a> of a non-zero <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> in one variable with <a href="rational%20number">rational</a> coefficients (or equivalently – by clearing <a href="denominator">denominator</a>s – with <a href="integer">integer</a> coefficients). All <a href="integer">integer</a>s and <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s are algebraic, as are all roots of integers. The same is not true for all <a href="real%20number">real</a> and <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s because they also include <a href="transcendental%20number">transcendental number</a>s such as <a href="Pi"></a> and <a href="e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">e</a>. <a href="Almost%20all">Almost all</a> real and complex numbers are transcendental.



The sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the <a href="resultant">resultant</a>), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> Q (sometimes denoted by A, though this usually denotes the <a href="adele%20ring">adele ring</a>). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are "algebraic numbers" is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is <a href="algebraically%20closed%20field">algebraically closed</a>. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the <a href="algebraic%20closure">algebraic closure</a> of the rationals.

The set of "real" algebraic numbers itself forms a field.

All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a <a href="finite%20set">finite</a> number of integer <a href="addition">addition</a>s, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>s, <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a>s, <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a>s, and taking "n"th roots where "n" is a positive integer (i.e., <a href="radical%20expression">radical expression</a>s) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree ≥5. This is a result of <a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a> (see <a href="Quintic%20equation">Quintic equation</a>s and the <a href="Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini%20theorem">Abel–Ruffini theorem</a>). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial (which is approximately 1.167304).

Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to "<a href="closed-form%20number">closed-form number</a>s", which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called "elementary numbers", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers "explicitly" defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as "e" or log(2).

An <a href="algebraic%20integer">algebraic integer</a> is an algebraic number that is a root of a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are , , and Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper <a href="superset">superset</a> of the <a href="integer">integer</a>s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials for all In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what <a href="integer">integer</a>s are to <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s.

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a <a href="Ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>. The name "algebraic integer" comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any <a href="algebraic%20number%20field">number field</a> are in many ways analogous to the integers. If "K" is a number field, its <a href="ring%20of%20integers">ring of integers</a> is the subring of algebraic integers in "K", and is frequently denoted as "O". These are the prototypical examples of <a href="Dedekind%20domain">Dedekind domain</a>s.

<doc id="1160" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1160" title="Automorphism">
Automorphism

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, an automorphism is an <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a> from a <a href="mathematical%20object">mathematical object</a> to itself. It is, in some sense, a <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> of the object, and a way of <a href="map%20%28mathematics%29">mapping</a> the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a>, called the automorphism group. It is, loosely speaking, the <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a> of the object.

The exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of "mathematical object" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an "isomorphism" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a>. Category theory deals with abstract objects and <a href="morphism">morphism</a>s between those objects.

In category theory, an automorphism is an <a href="endomorphism">endomorphism</a> (i.e., a <a href="morphism">morphism</a> from an object to itself) which is also an <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a> (in the categorical sense of the word).

This is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.

In the context of <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, for example, a mathematical object is an <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a> such as a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a>, <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>, or <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>. An isomorphism is simply a <a href="bijective">bijective</a> <a href="homomorphism">homomorphism</a>. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, <a href="group%20homomorphism">group homomorphism</a>, <a href="ring%20homomorphism">ring homomorphism</a>, and <a href="linear%20operator">linear operator</a>).

The <a href="identity%20morphism">identity morphism</a> (<a href="identity%20mapping">identity mapping</a>) is called the trivial automorphism in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called nontrivial automorphisms.

If the automorphisms of an object form a set (instead of a proper <a href="class%20%28set%20theory%29">class</a>), then they form a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> under <a href="Function%20composition">composition</a> of <a href="morphism">morphism</a>s. This group is called the automorphism group of .

The automorphism group of an object "X" in a category "C" is denoted Aut("X"), or simply Aut("X") if the category is clear from context.


One of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician <a href="William%20Rowan%20Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a> in 1856, in his <a href="icosian%20calculus">icosian calculus</a>, where he discovered an order two automorphism, writing:
so that formula_1 is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root formula_2 by relations of perfect reciprocity.

In some categories—notably <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">groups</a>, <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a>, and <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>s—it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called "inner" and "outer" automorphisms.

In the case of groups, the <a href="inner%20automorphism">inner automorphism</a>s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element "a" of a group "G", conjugation by "a" is the operation given by (or "a""ga"; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by "a" is a group automorphism. The inner automorphisms form a <a href="normal%20subgroup">normal subgroup</a> of Aut("G"), denoted by Inn("G"); this is called <a href="Goursat%27s%20lemma">Goursat's lemma</a>.

The other automorphisms are called <a href="outer%20automorphism">outer automorphism</a>s. The <a href="quotient%20group">quotient group</a> is usually denoted by Out("G"); the non-trivial elements are the cosets that contain the outer automorphisms.

The same definition holds in any <a href="unital%20algebra">unital</a> <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> or <a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebra</a> where "a" is any <a href="Unit%20%28ring%20theory%29">invertible element</a>. For <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>s the definition is slightly different.

<doc id="1162" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1162" title="Accordion">
Accordion

Accordions (from 19th century German "Akkordeon", from "Akkord"—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are a family of box-shaped <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s of the <a href="bellows">bellows</a>-driven <a href="free%20reed%20aerophone">free-reed aerophone</a> type, colloquially referred to as a <a href="squeezebox">squeezebox</a>. A person who plays the accordion is called an "accordionist". The <a href="concertina">concertina</a> and <a href="Bandoneon">bandoneón</a> are related; the <a href="harmonium">harmonium</a> and <a href="American%20reed%20organ">American reed organ</a> are in the same family.

The instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or <a href="Musical%20keyboard">keys</a>, causing "pallets" to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called "<a href="reed%20%28instrument%29">reeds</a>". These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block. The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand <a href="manual%20%28music%29">manual</a>, and the <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a>, consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.

The accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>) it is used in popular music (for example <a href="Forr%C3%B3">Forró</a>, <a href="M%C3%BAsica%20sertaneja">Sertanejo</a> and B-Pop in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>), whereas in other regions (such as <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and other countries in <a href="South%20America">South America</a>) it tends to be more used for <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> and <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> and as well as in regional and is often used in <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Nevertheless, in Europe and North America, <a href="Accordion%23Use%20in%20popular%20music">some popular music acts</a> also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is also used in <a href="Cajun%20music">cajun</a>, <a href="zydeco">zydeco</a>, <a href="jazz%20music">jazz music</a> and in both solo and orchestra performances of <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a>.
The <a href="piano%20accordion">piano accordion</a> is the official city instrument of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments. The oldest name for this group of instruments is "harmonika", from the Greek "harmonikos", meaning "harmonic, musical". Today, native versions of the name "accordion" are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion <a href="Accordion%23History">patented by Cyrill Demian</a>, which concerned "automatically coupled chords on the bass side".

Accordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:

The <a href="bellows">bellows</a> is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of <a href="articulation%20%28music%29">articulation</a>. Similar to a <a href="violin">violin</a>'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from <a href="pleat">pleat</a>ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal. It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal <a href="reed%20%28instrument%29">reeds</a> and producing sound by their vibration, applied pressure increasing the volume.

The keyboard touch is not <a href="keyboard%20expression">expressive</a> and does not affect <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>: all expression is effected through the bellows: some bellows effects as illustrated below:

The accordion's body consists of two wood boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals, respectively. Each side has <a href="grille">grille</a>s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the <a href="sound">sound</a> to better project. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment, however skilled players can reverse these roles.

The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single <a href="octave">octave</a> on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.

The accordion is an <a href="aerophone">aerophone</a>. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:

There is a wide range of instruments that are called "accordion". The different types have varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and <a href="Tejano%20music">Tejano music</a>, Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, Argentinian tango music and many other folk genres.

Different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a <a href="button%20%28control%29">button</a> layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a <a href="piano">piano</a>-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different "type":

Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:

Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding "banks", which can be further combined into "registers" producing differing "<a href="timbre">timbre</a>s". All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low <a href="register%20%28music%29">registers</a>. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the <a href="accordion%20reed%20ranks%20and%20switches">accordion reed ranks and switches</a> article for further explanation and audio samples.

All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches.

In describing/pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (3 octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a <a href="Accordion%20reed%20ranks%20and%20switches%23Cassotto">cassotto</a> or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as Reeds: 5 + 3, meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and Registers: 13 + M, 7, meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special "master" that activates all ranks, like the "tutti" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.
The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller <a href="squeezebox">squeezebox</a>es, and are equipped with two shoulder <a href="straps">straps</a> to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.

Other accordions, such as the <a href="diatonic%20button%20accordion">diatonic button accordion</a>, have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.

Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions. Many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use:

The accordion is a free reed instrument and is in the same family as other instruments such as the <a href="Sheng%20%28instrument%29">sheng</a> and <a href="khaen">khaen</a>. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as we know it today.

The accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1822 by <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Ludwig%20Buschmann">Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann</a>, although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier.

The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented. Nevertheless, according to Russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in <a href="Tula%2C%20Russia">Tula, Russia</a> by from 1820, and from 1830. By the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread; together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. By 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by Tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production rate was over 700,000. By the 1860s, <a href="Novgorod%20Governorate">Novgorod</a>, <a href="Vyatka%20Governorate">Vyatka</a> and <a href="Saratov%20Governorate">Saratov</a> Governorates also had significant accordion production. By the 1880s, the list included <a href="Oryol%20Governorate">Oryol</a>, <a href="Ryazan%20Governorate">Ryazan</a>, <a href="Moscow%20Governorate">Moscow</a>, <a href="Tver%20Governorate">Tver</a>, <a href="Vologda%20Governorate">Vologda</a>, <a href="Kostroma%20Governorate">Kostroma</a>, <a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod%20Governorate">Nizhny Novgorod</a>, <a href="Simbirsk%20Governorate">Simbirsk</a> and others, and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument.

The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that used free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called "accordion" was first patented in 1829 by <a href="Cyrill%20Demian">Cyrill Demian</a>, of Armenian origin, in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>

Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key; one for each bellows direction (a "bisonoric" action).

The piano accordion was first played in German-speaking regions, and then spread over Europe. Some early portable instrument with piano keys had been invented in 1821, but it started to actually be played much later, and built its reputation from there.

At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with "Kanzellen" (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both <a href="Bass%20%28sound%29">bass</a> and <a href="wikt%3Atreble">treble</a> sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.

By 1831 at least the accordion had appeared in Britain. The instrument was noted in "The Times" of that year as one new to British audiences and not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular. It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s at the latest.

After Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the righthanded keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to squeeze both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a “concertina” also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.
The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book, "Schule für Accordion". At the time, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and <a href="London">London</a> had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's <a href="flutina">flutina</a> resembles Wheatstone's <a href="concertina">concertina</a> in internal construction and <a href="tone%20color">tone color</a>, but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> button accordions still manufactured today.

Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.

The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or <a href="ethnic%20music">ethnic music</a>, popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire. Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock, pop-rock, etc., and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.

Invented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians and has been integrated into <a href="traditional%20music">traditional music</a> styles all over the world: see the <a href="list%20of%20music%20styles%20that%20incorporate%20the%20accordion">list of music styles that incorporate the accordion</a>.

The accordion appeared in <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> from the 1900s to the 1960s. This half-century is often called the "Golden Age of the Accordion". Five players, <a href="Pietro%20Frosini">Pietro Frosini</a>, the two brothers Count <a href="Guido%20Deiro">Guido Deiro</a> and <a href="Pietro%20Deiro">Pietro Deiro</a> and Slovenian brothers Vilko Ovsenik and <a href="Slavko%20Avsenik">Slavko Avsenik</a>, Charles Magnante were major influences at this time.

Most <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> theaters closed during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, but accordionists during the 1930s–1950s taught and performed for <a href="radio">radio</a>. Included among this group was the concert virtuoso <a href="John%20Serry%2C%20Sr.">John Serry, Sr.</a> During the 1950s through the 1980s the accordion received significant exposure on television with performances by <a href="Myron%20Floren">Myron Floren</a> on "<a href="The%20Lawrence%20Welk%20Show">The Lawrence Welk Show</a>". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accordion declined in popularity due to the rise of rock 'n' roll. The first Accordionist to appear and perform at the Newport Jazz Festival was Angelo DiPippo. He can be seen playing his accordion in the motion picture "The Godfather." He also composed and performed with his Accordion on part of the soundtrack of Woody Allen's movie "To Rome With Love." He was featured twice on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. 
Richard Galliano is an internationally known jazz accordionist. Some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds. A notable example is <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award-winning</a> <a href="Parody%20music">parodist</a> <a href="%26quot%3BWeird%20Al%26quot%3B%20Yankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>, who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his <a href="polka">polka</a>s. Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.

Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is "", written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Other composers, including the Russian <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>, the Italian <a href="Umberto%20Giordano">Umberto Giordano</a>, and the American <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a> (1915), wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.

The first composer to write specifically for the <a href="chromatic%20music">chromatic</a> accordion was <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a>. In 1922, the Austrian <a href="Alban%20Berg">Alban Berg</a> included an accordion in "<a href="Wozzeck">Wozzeck</a>", Op. 7. In 1937 the first <a href="Accordion%20concerto">Accordion concerto</a> was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century American composer <a href="William%20P.%20Perry">William P. Perry</a> featured the accordion in his orchestral suite "Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie" (2008). The experimental composer <a href="Howard%20Skempton">Howard Skempton</a> began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work "Drang" (1999), British composer <a href="http%3A//www.johnpalmer.org">John Palmer</a> has pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan to the limits of virtuosity. 
Accordionists like Geir Draugsvoll, <a href="Mogens%20Ellegaard">Mogens Ellegaard</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Macerollo">Joseph Macerollo</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Lips">Friedrich Lips</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Hussong">Stefan Hussong</a>, <a href="Teodoro%20Anzellotti">Teodoro Anzellotti</a>, Mie Miki, encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music (Bach, Scarlatti) on the free bass accordion.

French composer <a href="Henri%20Dutilleux">Henri Dutilleux</a> used an accordion in both his late song cycles "Correspondances" (2003) and "<a href="Le%20Temps%20l%27horloge">Le Temps l'Horloge</a>" (2009). Russian-born composer Sofia Gubaidulina has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion. Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely. Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works can be performed on either bandoneon or accordion.

The accordion is a traditional instrument in <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. It is the dominant instrument used in <a href="sevdalinka">sevdalinka</a>, a traditional genre of <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> from Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.

The accordion is widely used in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, in traditional as well as pop music. Compared to many other countries, the instrument enjoys in Brazil high popularity in mainstream pop music. In some parts of the country, such as the North-East it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.

The accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of <a href="Forr%C3%B3">Forró</a> (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and <a href="bai%C3%A3o%20%28music%29">Baião</a>) as principal instrument, <a href="Luiz%20Gonzaga">Luiz Gonzaga</a> (the King of the <a href="bai%C3%A3o%20%28music%29">Baião</a>) and <a href="Dominguinhos">Dominguinhos</a> being among the notable musicians in this style. In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, <a href="Triangle%20%28musical%20instrument%29">triangle</a> and <a href="zabumba">zabumba</a> (a type of drum). This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the South-East of the country (in the <a href="Forr%C3%B3">Forró</a> Universitário genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the São João Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music.

It is an important instrument in <a href="M%C3%BAsica%20sertaneja">Sertanejo</a> (and Caipira) music, which originated in the Centre-west and South-east of Brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country. In the South of the country (where there is a preponderance of the button accordion), in particular in <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, it used in the Brazilian Gaúcho musical style, an important exponent of this music being <a href="Renato%20Borghetti">Renato Borghetti</a>.

The accordion is also a traditional instrument in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, commonly associated with the <a href="vallenato">vallenato</a> and <a href="cumbia">cumbia</a> genres. The accordion has been used by <a href="tropipop">tropipop</a> musicians such as <a href="Carlos%20Vives">Carlos Vives</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Cabas">Andrés Cabas</a>, <a href="Fonseca%20%28singer%29">Fonseca (singer)</a> and <a href="Bacilos">Bacilos</a>, as well as <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> musicians such as <a href="Juanes">Juanes</a> and pop musicians as <a href="Shakira">Shakira</a>. Vallenato, which emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, has come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia. The legend of the accordion's arrival in Colombia comes from a story of a ship wreck that was coming from Germany to Argentina. The wreck happened over the Magdalena river in the Atlantic coast.

Every year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the <a href="Vallenato%20Legend%20Festival">Vallenato Legend Festival</a>. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the King of Kings accordion competition takes place, when winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the "Pilonera Mayor" prize. This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.

<a href="Norte%C3%B1o%20%28music%29">Norteño</a> heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to <a href="polka">polka</a>. <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Ayala">Ramón Ayala</a> known in Mexico as the "King of the Accordion" is a norteño musician. <a href="Cumbia">Cumbia</a> which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as <a href="Celso%20Pi%C3%B1a">Celso Piña</a> creating a more contemporary style.

U.S. born Mexican musician <a href="Julieta%20Venegas">Julieta Venegas</a> incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock, pop and folk. She was influenced by her fellow Chicanos <a href="Los%20Lobos">Los Lobos</a> who also use the music of the accordion.

The accordion is widely taught in North Korea. It is known as the "National Instrument." All North Korean student are expected to learn the accordion throughout their elementary and secondary education. On Kim Jong-il's birthday, the most important public holiday in North Korea, revolutionary songs like "<a href="Sea%20of%20Blood">Sea of Blood</a>" and are often played on the accordion.

Accordionists in <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> make their most extensive appearances in the <a href="folk%20metal">folk metal</a> subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances.

Notably, the Finnish symphonic folk-metal band <a href="Turisas">Turisas</a> has always had a full-time accordionist, employing <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> and <a href="polka">polka</a>-style sensibilities alongside a violinist. Another Finnish metal band, <a href="Korpiklaani">Korpiklaani</a>, invokes a type of Finnish polka called <a href="humppa">humppa</a>, and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former <a href="hurdy-gurdy">hurdy-gurdy</a> player for the Swiss melodic-death/folk metal band <a href="Eluveitie">Eluveitie</a>, played a <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic</a> accordion known as a "zugerörgeli", which could be a distant relative (in one way or another) to the Swiss <a href="schwyzer%C3%B6rgeli">schwyzerörgeli</a>, as both are indigenous to and very rare outside of Switzerland.

The best accordions are always fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far better tonal quality than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui, a Japanese-born craftsman.

The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.

Famous centres of production are the Italian cities of <a href="Stradella%2C%20Lombardy">Stradella</a> and <a href="Castelfidardo">Castelfidardo</a>, with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. The French town of <a href="Tulle">Tulle</a> has hosted Maugein Freres since 1919, and the company is now the last complete-process manufacturer of accordions in France. German companies such as <a href="Hohner">Hohner</a> and <a href="Weltmeister">Weltmeister</a> made large numbers of accordions, but production had diminished by the end of the 20th century. Hohner still manufactures its top-end models in Germany, and Weltmeister instruments are still handmade by <a href="VEB%20Klingenthaler%20Harmonikawerke">HARMONA Akkordeon GmbH</a> in <a href="Klingenthal">Klingenthal</a>. Cheaper /student models are often made in China.

Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is apparently <a href="Intelligence">intelligent</a> behaviour by <a href="machine">machine</a>s, rather than the "natural intelligence" ("NI") of humans and other animals. In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> AI research is defined as the study of "<a href="intelligent%20agent">intelligent agent</a>s": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other <a href="human%20mind">human mind</a>s, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring "intelligence" are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the <a href="AI%20effect">AI effect</a>, leading to the quip "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet." For instance, <a href="optical%20character%20recognition">optical character recognition</a> is frequently excluded from "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology. Capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully <a href="natural%20language%20understanding">understanding human speech</a>, competing at a high level in <a href="strategic%20game">strategic game</a> systems (such as <a href="chess">chess</a> and <a href="Go%20%28game%29">Go</a>), <a href="autonomous%20car">autonomous car</a>s, intelligent routing in <a href="content%20delivery%20network">content delivery network</a>s, military simulations, and interpreting complex data.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "<a href="AI%20winter">AI winter</a>"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. However, in the early 21st century <a href="%23Statistical">statistical approaches</a> to <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> became successful enough to eclipse all other tools, approaches, problems and schools of thought.
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include <a href="reason">reason</a>ing, <a href="knowledge">knowledge</a>, <a href="Automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">planning</a>, <a href="learning">learning</a>, <a href="natural%20language%20processing">natural language processing</a>, <a href="perception">perception</a> and the ability to move and manipulate objects. <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">General intelligence</a> is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include <a href="%23Statistical">statistical methods</a>, <a href="%23Sub-symbolic">computational intelligence</a>, and <a href="%23Symbolic">traditional symbolic AI</a>. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of <a href="%23Search%20and%20optimization">search and mathematical optimization</a>, <a href="%23Neural%20networks">neural networks</a> and <a href="%23Probabilistic%20methods%20for%20uncertain%20reasoning">methods based on statistics, probability and economics</a>. The AI field draws upon <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="neuroscience">neuroscience</a>, <a href="artificial%20psychology">artificial psychology</a> and many others.
The field was founded on the claim that <a href="human%20intelligence">human intelligence</a> "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it". This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the <a href="mind">mind</a> and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by <a href="History%20of%20AI%23AI%20in%20myth%2C%20fiction%20and%20speculation">myth</a>, <a href="artificial%20intelligence%20in%20fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="philosophy%20of%20AI">philosophy</a> since <a href="ancient%20history">antiquity</a>. Some people also consider AI a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly.
In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in <a href="Computer%20performance">computer power</a>, large amounts of <a href="big%20data">data</a>, and theoretical understanding, and AI techniques have become an essential part of the <a href="technology%20industry">technology industry</a>, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science.

While thought-capable <a href="artificial%20being">artificial being</a>s appeared as <a href="storytelling%20device">storytelling device</a>s in antiquity, the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with <a href="Ramon%20Llull">Ramon Llull</a> (c. 1300 CE). With his <a href="Calculus%20ratiocinator">Calculus ratiocinator</a>, <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> extended the concept of the <a href="calculating%20machine">calculating machine</a> (<a href="Wilhelm%20Schickard">Wilhelm Schickard</a> engineered the first one around 1623), intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers. Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" or <a href="Karel%20%C4%8Capek">Karel Čapek</a>'s "<a href="R.U.R.%20%28Rossum%27s%20Universal%20Robots%29">R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)</a>".
The study of mechanical or <a href="formal%20reasoning">"formal" reasoning</a> began with <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>s and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s <a href="theory%20of%20computation">theory of computation</a>, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning, is known as the <a href="Church%E2%80%93Turing%20thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>. Along with concurrent discoveries in <a href="neurology">neurology</a>, <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a> and <a href="cybernetic">cybernetic</a>s, this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was <a href="Warren%20McCullouch">McCullouch</a> and <a href="Walter%20Pitts">Pitts</a>' 1943 formal design for <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a> "artificial neurons".
The field of AI research was born at <a href="Dartmouth%20workshop">a workshop</a> at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> in 1956. Attendees <a href="Allen%20Newell">Allen Newell</a> (<a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">CMU</a>), <a href="Herbert%20A.%20Simon">Herbert Simon</a> (<a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">CMU</a>), <a href="John%20McCarthy%20%28computer%20scientist%29">John McCarthy</a> (<a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>), <a href="Marvin%20Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> (<a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>) and <a href="Arthur%20Samuel">Arthur Samuel</a> (<a href="IBM">IBM</a>) became the founders and leaders of AI research. They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing": computers were winning at the game checkers, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the <a href="DARPA">Department of Defense</a> and laboratories had been established around the world. AI's founders were optimistic about the future: <a href="Herbert%20A.%20Simon">Herbert Simon</a> predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". <a href="Marvin%20Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".
They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of <a href="Sir%20James%20Lighthill">Sir James Lighthill</a> and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "<a href="AI%20winter">AI winter</a>", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of <a href="expert%20system">expert system</a>s, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985 the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's <a href="fifth%20generation%20computer">fifth generation computer</a> project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the <a href="Lisp%20Machine">Lisp Machine</a> market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used for logistics, <a href="data%20mining">data mining</a>, <a href="medical%20diagnosis">medical diagnosis</a> and other areas. The success was due to increasing computational power (see <a href="Moore%27s%20law">Moore's law</a>), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards. <a href="IBM%20Deep%20Blue">Deep Blue</a> became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> on 11 May 1997.
Advanced statistical techniques (loosely known as <a href="deep%20learning">deep learning</a>), access to <a href="big%20data">large amounts of data</a> and <a href="Moore%27s%20law">faster computers</a> enabled advances in <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> and perception. By the mid 2010s, machine learning applications were used throughout the world. In a "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" <a href="quiz%20show">quiz show</a> exhibition match, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="question%20answering%20system">question answering system</a>, <a href="Watson%20%28artificial%20intelligence%20software%29">Watson</a>, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy champions, <a href="Brad%20Rutter">Brad Rutter</a> and <a href="Ken%20Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>, by a significant margin. The <a href="Kinect">Kinect</a>, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and the Xbox One use algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research as do <a href="intelligent%20personal%20assistant">intelligent personal assistant</a>s in <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a>s. In March 2016, <a href="AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a> won 4 out of 5 games of <a href="Go%20%28game%29">Go</a> in a match with Go champion <a href="Lee%20Sedol">Lee Sedol</a>, becoming the first <a href="Computer%20Go">computer Go-playing system</a> to beat a professional Go player without <a href="Go%20handicaps">handicaps</a>. In the 2017 <a href="Future%20of%20Go%20Summit">Future of Go Summit</a>, <a href="AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a> won a <a href="AlphaGo%20versus%20Ke%20Jie">three-game match</a> with <a href="Ke%20Jie">Ke Jie</a>, who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two years. This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is an extremely complex game, more so than Chess.

According to <a href="Bloomberg%20News">Bloomberg's</a> Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a "sporadic usage" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011. He attributes this to an increase in affordable <a href="Artificial%20neural%20network">neural networks</a>, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.
Other cited examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that can describe images to blind people.

The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.

Erik Sandwell emphasizes planning and learning that is relevant and applicable to the given situation.

Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with <a href="uncertainty">uncertain</a> or incomplete information, employing concepts from <a href="probability">probability</a> and <a href="economics">economics</a>.
For difficult problems, algorithms can require enormous computational resources—most experience a "<a href="combinatorial%20explosion">combinatorial explosion</a>": the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size. The search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority.

Human beings ordinarily use fast, intuitive judgments rather than step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. AI has progressed using "sub-symbolic" problem solving: <a href="embodied%20agent">embodied agent</a> approaches emphasize the importance of <a href="Sensory-motor%20coupling">sensorimotor</a> skills to higher reasoning; <a href="neural%20net">neural net</a> research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill; <a href="%23Statistical">statistical approaches to AI</a> mimic the human ability to guess.

<a href="Knowledge%20representation">Knowledge representation</a> and <a href="knowledge%20engineering">knowledge engineering</a> are central to AI research. Many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things that AI needs to represent are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of "what exists" is an <a href="ontology%20%28computer%20science%29">ontology</a>: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The <a href="semantics">semantics</a> of these are captured as <a href="description%20logic">description logic</a> concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the <a href="Web%20Ontology%20Language">Web Ontology Language</a>. The most general ontologies are called <a href="upper%20ontology">upper ontologies</a>, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge by acting as mediators between <a href="Ontology%20%28information%20science%29%23Domain%20ontology">domain ontologies</a> that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal knowledge representations are suitable for content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery via automated reasoning (inferring new statements based on explicitly stated knowledge), etc. Video events are often represented as <a href="Semantic%20Web%20Rule%20Language">SWRL</a> rules, which can be used, among others, to automatically generate subtitles for constrained videos.

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are:

Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them. They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the <a href="utility">utility</a> (or "value") of available choices.

In classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions. However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that cannot only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.

<a href="Multi-agent%20planning">Multi-agent planning</a> uses the <a href="cooperation">cooperation</a> and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. <a href="Emergent%20behavior">Emergent behavior</a> such as this is used by <a href="evolutionary%20algorithms">evolutionary algorithms</a> and <a href="swarm%20intelligence">swarm intelligence</a>.

Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.

<a href="Unsupervised%20learning">Unsupervised learning</a> is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. <a href="Supervised%20learning">Supervised learning</a> includes both <a href="statistical%20classification">classification</a> and numerical <a href="Regression%20analysis">regression</a>. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. In <a href="reinforcement%20learning">reinforcement learning</a> the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space. These three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a>, using concepts like <a href="utility%20%28economics%29">utility</a>. The mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of <a href="theoretical%20computer%20science">theoretical computer science</a> known as <a href="computational%20learning%20theory">computational learning theory</a>.

Within <a href="developmental%20robotics">developmental robotics</a>, developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).

<a href="Natural%20language%20processing">Natural language processing</a> gives machines the ability to read and <a href="natural%20language%20understanding">understand</a> human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable <a href="natural%20language%20user%20interface">natural language user interface</a>s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include <a href="information%20retrieval">information retrieval</a>, <a href="text%20mining">text mining</a>, <a href="question%20answering">question answering</a> and <a href="machine%20translation">machine translation</a>.

A common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing. Although these indexes require a large volume of user input, it is expected that increases in processor speeds and decreases in data storage costs will result in greater efficiency.

<a href="Machine%20perception">Machine perception</a> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, <a href="tactile%20sensor">tactile sensor</a>s, sonar and others) to deduce aspects of the world. <a href="Computer%20vision">Computer vision</a> is the ability to analyze visual input. A few selected subproblems are <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a>, <a href="facial%20recognition%20system">facial recognition</a> and <a href="object%20recognition">object recognition</a>.

The field of <a href="robotics">robotics</a> is closely related to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to handle tasks such as object manipulation and <a href="motion%20planning">navigation</a>, with sub-problems such as <a href="Robot%20localization">localization</a>, <a href="robotic%20mapping">mapping</a>, and <a href="motion%20planning">motion planning</a>. These systems require that an agent is able to: Be spatially cognizant of its surroundings, learn from and build a map of its environment, figure out how to get from one point in space to another, and execute that movement (which often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object).

Affective computing is the study and development of systems that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human <a href="Affect%20%28psychology%29">affects</a>. It is an interdisciplinary field spanning <a href="computer%20sciences">computer sciences</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, and <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>. While the origins of the field may be traced as far back as the early philosophical inquiries into <a href="Emotion%23The%20James-Lange%20Theory">emotion</a>, the more modern branch of computer science originated with <a href="Rosalind%20Picard">Rosalind Picard</a>'s 1995 paper on "affective computing". A motivation for the research is the ability to simulate <a href="empathy">empathy</a>, where the machine would be able to interpret human emotions and adapts its behavior to give an appropriate response to those emotions.

Emotion and social skills are important to an intelligent agent for two reasons. First, being able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states allow an agent to make better decisions. Concepts such as <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>, <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a>, necessitate that an agent be able to detect and model human emotions. Second, in an effort to facilitate <a href="human%E2%80%93computer%20interaction">human–computer interaction</a>, an intelligent machine may want to display emotions (even if it does not experience those emotions itself) to appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction.

A sub-field of AI addresses <a href="creativity">creativity</a> both theoretically (the philosophical psychological perspective) and practically (the specific implementation of systems that generate novel and useful outputs).

Many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a>, combining all the skills mentioned above and even exceeding human ability in most or all these areas. A few believe that <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a> features like <a href="artificial%20consciousness">artificial consciousness</a> or an <a href="artificial%20brain">artificial brain</a> may be required for such a project.

Many of the problems above also require that general intelligence be solved. For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like <a href="machine%20translation">machine translation</a>, require that a machine read and write in both languages (<a href="%23Natural%20language%20processing">NLP</a>), follow the author's argument (<a href="%23Deduction%2C%20reasoning%2C%20problem%20solving">reason</a>), know what is being talked about (<a href="%23Knowledge%20representation">knowledge</a>), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent (<a href="%23Social%20intelligence">social intelligence</a>). A problem like machine translation is considered "<a href="AI-complete">AI-complete</a>", but all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.

There is no established unifying theory or <a href="paradigm">paradigm</a> that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues. A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying <a href="psychology">psychology</a> or <a href="neurology">neurology</a>? Or is <a href="human%20biology">human biology</a> as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to <a href="aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a>?
Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as <a href="logic">logic</a> or <a href="optimization%20%28mathematics%29">optimization</a>)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?
Can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols, similar to words and ideas? Or does it require "sub-symbolic" processing?
John Haugeland, who coined the term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also proposed that AI should more properly be referred to as <a href="synthetic%20intelligence">synthetic intelligence</a>, a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.

Stuart Shapiro divides AI research into three approaches, which he calls computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior. Computational philosophy, is used to develop an adaptive, free-flowing computer mind. Implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish. Together, the humanesque behavior, mind, and actions make up artificial intelligence.

In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between <a href="neurology">neurology</a>, <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, and <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as <a href="W.%20Grey%20Walter">W. Grey Walter</a>'s <a href="turtle%20%28robot%29">turtles</a> and the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Beast">Johns Hopkins Beast</a>. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and the <a href="Ratio%20Club">Ratio Club</a> in England. By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.

When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, <a href="Stanford">Stanford</a> and <a href="MIT">MIT</a>, and each one developed its own style of research. <a href="John%20Haugeland">John Haugeland</a> named these approaches to AI "good old fashioned AI" or "<a href="GOFAI">GOFAI</a>". During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a> or <a href="neural%20network">neural network</a>s were abandoned or pushed into the background.
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">artificial general intelligence</a> and considered this the goal of their field.

Economist <a href="Herbert%20A.%20Simon">Herbert Simon</a> and <a href="Allen%20Newell">Allen Newell</a> studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>, <a href="operations%20research">operations research</a> and <a href="management%20science">management science</a>. Their research team used the results of <a href="psychology">psychological</a> experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> would eventually culminate in the development of the <a href="Soar%20%28cognitive%20architecture%29">Soar</a> architecture in the middle 1980s.

Unlike <a href="Allen%20Newell">Newell</a> and <a href="Herbert%20A.%20Simon">Simon</a>, <a href="John%20McCarthy%20%28computer%20scientist%29">John McCarthy</a> felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms. His laboratory at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford</a> (<a href="Stanford%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Laboratory">SAIL</a>) focused on using formal <a href="logic">logic</a> to solve a wide variety of problems, including <a href="knowledge%20representation">knowledge representation</a>, <a href="automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">planning</a> and <a href="machine%20learning">learning</a>. Logic was also the focus of the work at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language <a href="Prolog">Prolog</a> and the science of <a href="logic%20programming">logic programming</a>.

Researchers at <a href="MIT">MIT</a> (such as <a href="Marvin%20Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> and <a href="Seymour%20Papert">Seymour Papert</a>) found that solving difficult problems in <a href="computer%20vision">vision</a> and <a href="natural%20language%20processing">natural language processing</a> required ad-hoc solutions – they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like <a href="logic">logic</a>) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. <a href="Roger%20Schank">Roger Schank</a> described their "anti-logic" approaches as "<a href="Neats%20vs.%20scruffies">scruffy</a>" (as opposed to the "<a href="neats%20vs.%20scruffies">neat</a>" paradigms at <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">CMU</a> and <a href="Stanford">Stanford</a>). <a href="Commonsense%20knowledge%20bases">Commonsense knowledge bases</a> (such as <a href="Doug%20Lenat">Doug Lenat</a>'s <a href="Cyc">Cyc</a>) are an example of "scruffy" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.

When computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build <a href="knowledge%20representation">knowledge</a> into AI applications. This "knowledge revolution" led to the development and deployment of <a href="expert%20system">expert system</a>s (introduced by <a href="Edward%20Feigenbaum">Edward Feigenbaum</a>), the first truly successful form of AI software. The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.

By the 1980s progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially <a href="machine%20perception">perception</a>, <a href="robotics">robotics</a>, <a href="machine%20learning">learning</a> and <a href="pattern%20recognition">pattern recognition</a>. A number of researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific AI problems. Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.

This includes <a href="embodied%20agent">embodied</a>, <a href="situated">situated</a>, <a href="behavior-based%20AI">behavior-based</a>, and <a href="nouvelle%20AI">nouvelle AI</a>. Researchers from the related field of <a href="robotics">robotics</a>, such as <a href="Rodney%20Brooks">Rodney Brooks</a>, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive. Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early <a href="cybernetic">cybernetic</a>s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a> in AI. This coincided with the development of the <a href="embodied%20mind%20thesis">embodied mind thesis</a> in the related field of <a href="cognitive%20science">cognitive science</a>: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.

Interest in <a href="neural%20networks">neural networks</a> and "<a href="connectionism">connectionism</a>" was revived by <a href="David%20Rumelhart">David Rumelhart</a> and others in the middle of 1980s. Neural networks are an example of <a href="soft%20computing">soft computing</a> --- they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other <a href="soft%20computing">soft computing</a> approaches to AI include <a href="fuzzy%20system">fuzzy system</a>s, <a href="evolutionary%20computation">evolutionary computation</a> and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of <a href="computational%20intelligence">computational intelligence</a>.

In the 1990s, AI researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems. These tools are truly <a href="scientific%20method">scientific</a>, in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable, and they have been responsible for many of AI's recent successes. The shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, economics or <a href="operations%20research">operations research</a>). <a href="Stuart%20J.%20Russell">Stuart Russell</a> and <a href="Peter%20Norvig">Peter Norvig</a> describe this movement as nothing less than a "revolution" and "the victory of the <a href="neats%20and%20scruffies">neats</a>". Critics argue that these techniques (with few exceptions) are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence. There is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in AI, exemplified in part by exchanges between <a href="Peter%20Norvig">Peter Norvig</a> and <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>.


In the course of 60+ years of research, AI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.

Many problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions: <a href="%23Deduction%2C%20reasoning%2C%20problem%20solving">Reasoning</a> can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from <a href="premise">premise</a>s to <a href="Logical%20consequence">conclusions</a>, where each step is the application of an <a href="inference%20rule">inference rule</a>. <a href="Automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">Planning</a> algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called <a href="means-ends%20analysis">means-ends analysis</a>. <a href="Robotics">Robotics</a> algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use <a href="local%20search%20%28optimization%29">local searches</a> in <a href="Configuration%20space%20%28physics%29">configuration space</a>. Many <a href="machine%20learning">learning</a> algorithms use search algorithms based on <a href="optimization%20%28mathematics%29">optimization</a>.

Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real world problems: the <a href="search%20algorithm">search space</a> (the number of places to search) quickly grows to <a href="Large%20numbers%23Astronomically%20large%20numbers">astronomical numbers</a>. The result is a search that is <a href="Computation%20time">too slow</a> or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use "<a href="heuristics">heuristics</a>" or "rules of thumb" that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal (called "<a href="pruning%20%28algorithm%29">pruning</a> the <a href="search%20tree">search tree</a>"). <a href="Heuristics">Heuristics</a> supply the program with a "best guess" for the path on which the solution lies. Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of <a href="optimization%20%28mathematics%29">optimization</a>. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind <a href="hill%20climbing">hill climbing</a>: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are <a href="simulated%20annealing">simulated annealing</a>, <a href="beam%20search">beam search</a> and <a href="random%20optimization">random optimization</a>.

<a href="Evolutionary%20computation">Evolutionary computation</a> uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, <a href="natural%20selection">selecting</a> only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Forms of <a href="evolutionary%20computation">evolutionary computation</a> include <a href="swarm%20intelligence">swarm intelligence</a> algorithms (such as <a href="ant%20colony%20optimization">ant colony</a> or <a href="particle%20swarm%20optimization">particle swarm optimization</a>) and <a href="evolutionary%20algorithms">evolutionary algorithms</a> (such as <a href="genetic%20algorithms">genetic algorithms</a>, <a href="gene%20expression%20programming">gene expression programming</a>, and <a href="genetic%20programming">genetic programming</a>).

<a href="Logic">Logic</a> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the <a href="satplan">satplan</a> algorithm uses logic for <a href="automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">planning</a> and <a href="inductive%20logic%20programming">inductive logic programming</a> is a method for <a href="machine%20learning">learning</a>.

Several different forms of logic are used in AI research. <a href="Propositional%20logic">Propositional</a> or <a href="sentential%20logic">sentential logic</a> is the logic of statements which can be true or false. <a href="First-order%20logic">First-order logic</a> also allows the use of <a href="quantifier%20%28logic%29">quantifiers</a> and <a href="predicate%20%28mathematical%20logic%29">predicates</a>, and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. <a href="Fuzzy%20logic">Fuzzy logic</a>, is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1, rather than simply True (1) or False (0). <a href="Fuzzy%20system">Fuzzy system</a>s can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer <a href="Pattern%20recognition">product control systems</a>. <a href="Subjective%20logic">Subjective logic</a> models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic: a given binomial opinion satisfies belief + disbelief + uncertainty = 1 within a <a href="Beta%20distribution">Beta distribution</a>. By this method, ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence.

<a href="Default%20logic">Default logic</a>s, <a href="non-monotonic%20logic">non-monotonic logic</a>s and <a href="circumscription%20%28logic%29">circumscription</a> are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the <a href="qualification%20problem">qualification problem</a>. Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of <a href="knowledge%20representation">knowledge</a>, such as: <a href="description%20logic">description logic</a>s; <a href="situation%20calculus">situation calculus</a>, <a href="event%20calculus">event calculus</a> and <a href="fluent%20calculus">fluent calculus</a> (for representing events and time); <a href="Causality%23Causal%20calculus">causal calculus</a>; belief calculus; and <a href="modal%20logic">modal logic</a>s.

Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from <a href="probability">probability</a> theory and economics.

<a href="Bayesian%20network">Bayesian network</a>s are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian inference</a> algorithm), <a href="Machine%20learning">learning</a> (using the <a href="expectation-maximization%20algorithm">expectation-maximization algorithm</a>), <a href="Automated%20planning%20and%20scheduling">planning</a> (using <a href="decision%20network">decision network</a>s) and <a href="machine%20perception">perception</a> (using <a href="dynamic%20Bayesian%20network">dynamic Bayesian network</a>s). Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping <a href="machine%20perception">perception</a> systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., <a href="hidden%20Markov%20model">hidden Markov model</a>s or <a href="Kalman%20filter">Kalman filter</a>s).

A key concept from the science of economics is "<a href="utility">utility</a>": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using <a href="decision%20theory">decision theory</a>, <a href="decision%20analysis">decision analysis</a>, and <a href="applied%20information%20economics">information value theory</a>. These tools include models such as <a href="Markov%20decision%20process">Markov decision process</a>es, dynamic <a href="decision%20network">decision network</a>s, <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a> and <a href="mechanism%20design">mechanism design</a>.

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers ("if shiny then diamond") and controllers ("if shiny then pick up"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. <a href="Classifier%20%28mathematics%29">Classifiers</a> are functions that use <a href="pattern%20matching">pattern matching</a> to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.

A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> approaches. The most widely used classifiers are the <a href="Artificial%20neural%20network">neural network</a>,
<a href="kernel%20methods">kernel methods</a> such as the <a href="support%20vector%20machine">support vector machine</a>,
<a href="k-nearest%20neighbor%20algorithm">k-nearest neighbor algorithm</a>,
<a href="Gaussian%20mixture%20model">Gaussian mixture model</a>,
<a href="naive%20Bayes%20classifier">naive Bayes classifier</a>,
and <a href="decision%20tree%20learning">decision tree</a>.
The performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks. Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified. There is no single classifier that works best on all given problems; this is also referred to as the "<a href="No%20free%20lunch%20in%20search%20and%20optimization">no free lunch</a>" theorem. Determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science.

Neural networks are modeled after the neurons in the human brain, where a trained algorithm determines an output response for input signals. . The study of non-learning <a href="artificial%20neural%20network">artificial neural network</a>s began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of <a href="Walter%20Pitts">Walter Pitts</a> and <a href="Warren%20McCullouch">Warren McCullouch</a>. <a href="Frank%20Rosenblatt">Frank Rosenblatt</a> invented the <a href="perceptron">perceptron</a>, a learning network with a single layer, similar to the old concept of <a href="linear%20regression">linear regression</a>. Early pioneers also include <a href="Alexey%20Grigorevich%20Ivakhnenko">Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko</a>, <a href="Teuvo%20Kohonen">Teuvo Kohonen</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Grossberg">Stephen Grossberg</a>, <a href="Kunihiko%20Fukushima">Kunihiko Fukushima</a>, Christoph von der Malsburg, David Willshaw, <a href="Shun-Ichi%20Amari">Shun-Ichi Amari</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Widrow">Bernard Widrow</a>, <a href="John%20Hopfield">John Hopfield</a>, <a href="Eduardo%20R.%20Caianiello">Eduardo R. Caianiello</a>, and others.

The main categories of networks are acyclic or <a href="feedforward%20neural%20network">feedforward neural network</a>s (where the signal passes in only one direction) and <a href="recurrent%20neural%20network">recurrent neural network</a>s (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are <a href="perceptron">perceptron</a>s, <a href="multi-layer%20perceptron">multi-layer perceptron</a>s and <a href="radial%20basis%20network">radial basis network</a>s. Neural networks can be applied to the problem of <a href="intelligent%20control">intelligent control</a> (for robotics) or <a href="machine%20learning">learning</a>, using such techniques as <a href="Hebbian%20learning">Hebbian learning</a>, <a href="GMDH">GMDH</a> or <a href="competitive%20learning">competitive learning</a>.

Today, neural networks are often trained by the <a href="backpropagation">backpropagation</a> algorithm, which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of <a href="automatic%20differentiation">automatic differentiation</a> published by <a href="Seppo%20Linnainmaa">Seppo Linnainmaa</a>, and was introduced to neural networks by <a href="Paul%20Werbos">Paul Werbos</a>.

<a href="Hierarchical%20temporal%20memory">Hierarchical temporal memory</a> is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the <a href="neocortex">neocortex</a>.

<a href="Deep%20learning">Deep learning</a> in <a href="artificial%20neural%20networks">artificial neural networks</a> with many layers has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including <a href="computer%20vision">computer vision</a>, <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a>, <a href="natural%20language%20processing">natural language processing</a> and others.

According to a survey, the expression "Deep Learning" was introduced to the <a href="Machine%20Learning">Machine Learning</a> community by <a href="Rina%20Dechter">Rina Dechter</a> in 1986 and gained traction after
Igor Aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to <a href="Artificial%20Neural%20Networks">Artificial Neural Networks</a> in 2000. The first functional Deep Learning networks were published by <a href="Alexey%20Grigorevich%20Ivakhnenko">Alexey Grigorevich Ivakhnenko</a> and V. G. Lapa in 1965. These networks are trained one layer at a time. Ivakhnenko's 1971 paper describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers, already much deeper than many later networks. In 2006, a publication by <a href="Geoffrey%20Hinton">Geoffrey Hinton</a> and Ruslan Salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered <a href="feedforward%20neural%20network">feedforward neural network</a>s (FNNs) one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an <a href="unsupervised%20learning">unsupervised</a> <a href="restricted%20Boltzmann%20machine">restricted Boltzmann machine</a>, then using <a href="supervised%20learning">supervised</a> <a href="backpropagation">backpropagation</a> for fine-tuning. Similar to shallow artificial neural networks, deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships. Over the last few years, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer.

Deep learning often uses <a href="convolutional%20neural%20network">convolutional neural network</a>s (CNNs), whose origins can be traced back to the <a href="Neocognitron">Neocognitron</a> introduced by <a href="Kunihiko%20Fukushima">Kunihiko Fukushima</a> in 1980. In 1989, <a href="Yann%20LeCun">Yann LeCun</a> and colleagues applied <a href="backpropagation">backpropagation</a> to such an architecture. In the early 2000s, in an industrial application CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US.
Since 2011, fast implementations of CNNs on GPUs have
won many visual pattern recognition competitions.

Deep feedforward neural networks were used in conjunction with <a href="reinforcement%20learning">reinforcement learning</a> by <a href="AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>, Google Deepmind's program that was the first to beat a professional human <a href="Go%20%28game%29">Go</a> player.

Early on, <a href="deep%20learning">deep learning</a> was also applied to sequence learning with <a href="recurrent%20neural%20networks">recurrent neural networks</a> (RNNs) which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The depth of an RNN is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence. RNNs can be trained by <a href="gradient%20descent">gradient descent</a> but suffer from the <a href="vanishing%20gradient%20problem">vanishing gradient problem</a>. In 1992, it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of <a href="recurrent%20neural%20network">recurrent neural network</a>s can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems.

Numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent NN called the <a href="long%20short-term%20memory">long short-term memory</a> (LSTM) network published by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber in 1997. LSTM is often trained by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). At Google, Microsoft and Baidu this approach has revolutionised <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a>. For example, in 2015, Google's speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which is now available through <a href="Google%20Voice">Google Voice</a> to billions of smartphone users. Google also used LSTM to improve machine translation, Language Modeling and Multilingual Language Processing. LSTM combined with CNNs also improved automatic image captioning and a plethora of other applications.

<a href="Control%20theory">Control theory</a>, the grandchild of <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, has many important applications, especially in <a href="robotics">robotics</a>.

AI researchers have developed several specialized languages for AI research, including <a href="Lisp%20programming%20language">Lisp</a>, <a href="Prolog">Prolog</a>, <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>, and <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>.

In 1950, <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the <a href="Turing%20test">Turing test</a>. This procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested. However, it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail.

Artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry, hand-writing recognition and game-playing. Such tests have been termed <a href="subject%20matter%20expert%20Turing%20test">subject matter expert Turing test</a>s. Smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.

For example, performance at <a href="draughts">draughts</a> (i.e. checkers) is optimal, performance at chess is high-human and nearing super-human (see <a href="Computer%20chess%23Computers%20versus%20humans">computer chess: computers versus human</a>) and performance at many everyday tasks (such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something) is sub-human.

A quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from "mathematical" definitions of intelligence. Examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from <a href="Kolmogorov%20complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a> and <a href="data%20compression">data compression</a>. Two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.

A derivative of the Turing test is the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (<a href="CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>). As the name implies, this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human. In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.

AI is relevant to any intellectual task. Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the <a href="AI%20effect">AI effect</a>.

High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as <a href="Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">drones</a> and <a href="self-driving%20cars">self-driving cars</a>), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as <a href="Google%20search">Google search</a>), online assistants (such as <a href="Siri">Siri</a>), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions and targeting online advertisements.

With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution, major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.

There are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence. The main areas promoted are: general machine intelligence, conversational behavior, data-mining, <a href="autonomous%20car">robotic cars</a>, robot soccer and games.

Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.  There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient. One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting <a href="acute%20myeloid%20leukemia">myeloid leukemia</a>, a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.

According to <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, there was a recent study by surgeons at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington which successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel during open surgery, and doing so better than a human surgeon, the team claimed. IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the <a href="IBM%20Watson">IBM Watson</a> which has beaten human intelligence in many level. Watson was taken to a game show jeopardy to test its intelligence and was able to win the game show against the jeopardy champions. Watson did not just won Jeopardy against the champions but, Watson was declare a hero when he was able to successfully diagnosed a women who was suffering from leukemia.

Advancements in AI have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of <a href="driverless%20cars">driverless cars</a>. A few companies involved with AI include <a href="Tesla%20Motors">Tesla</a>, <a href="Google">Google</a>, and <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>.

Many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle.

Recent developments in autonomous automobiles have made the innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though the they are still in the testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018. Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway. 

One main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less automobiles to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings. Some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.

<a href="Financial%20institution">Financial institution</a>s have long used <a href="artificial%20neural%20network">artificial neural network</a> systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in <a href="banking">banking</a> can be traced back to 1987 when <a href="Security%20Pacific%20National%20Bank">Security Pacific National Bank</a> in USA set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards. Apps like Kasisito and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.

Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place. In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated <a href="stock%20trader">financial trading</a> competition. AI has also reduced fraud and financial crimes by monitoring <a href="behavioral%20pattern">behavioral pattern</a>s of users for any abnormal changes or anomalies.

Artificial intelligence is used to generate intelligent behaviors primarily in <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs), often simulating human-like intelligence.

A <a href="platform%20%28computing%29">platform</a> (or "<a href="computing%20platform">computing platform</a>") is defined as "some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run". As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago, it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the AI features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself that affects the AI that results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.

A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from <a href="expert%20systems">expert systems</a> such as <a href="Cyc">Cyc</a> to <a href="Deep%20learning%23Software%20libraries">deep-learning frameworks</a> to robot platforms such as the <a href="Roomba">Roomba</a> with open interface. Recent advances in deep <a href="artificial%20neural%20network">artificial neural network</a>s and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries, including <a href="Deeplearning4j">Deeplearning4j</a>, <a href="TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="Theano%20%28software%29">Theano</a> and <a href="Torch%20%28machine%20learning%29">Torch</a>.

Collective AI is a platform architecture that combines individual AI into a collective entity, in order to achieve global results from individual behaviors. With its collective structure, developers can crowdsource information and extend the functionality of existing AI domains on the platform for their own use, as well as continue to create and share new domains and capabilities for the wider community and greater good. As developers continue to contribute, the overall platform grows more intelligent and is able to perform more requests, providing a scalable model for greater communal benefit. Organizations like <a href="SoundHound">SoundHound</a> Inc. and the <a href="Harvard%20John%20A.%20Paulson%20School%20of%20Engineering%20and%20Applied%20Sciences">Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> have used this collaborative AI model.

Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have established a non-profit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies, advance the public's understanding, and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence. They stated: "This partnership on AI will conduct research, organize discussions, provide thought leadership, consult with relevant third parties, respond to questions from the public and media, and create educational material that advance the understanding of AI technologies including machine perception, learning, and automated reasoning." Apple joined other tech companies as a founding member of the Partnership on AI in January 2017. The corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group, while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board.

There are three philosophical questions related to AI:

Can a machine be intelligent? Can it "think"?







Widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable. Scientists from the <a href="Future%20of%20Life%20Institute">Future of Life Institute</a>, among others, described some short-term research goals to be how AI influences the economy, the laws and ethics that are involved with AI and how to minimize AI security risks. In the long-term, the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies.

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. Research in this area includes "machine ethics", "artificial moral agents", and the study of "malevolent vs. friendly AI".

A common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to mankind. This concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a>, and <a href="Elon%20Musk">Elon Musk</a>. A group of prominent tech titans including <a href="Peter%20Thiel">Peter Thiel</a>, Amazon Web Services and Musk have committed $1billion to <a href="OpenAI">OpenAI</a> a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible AI development. The opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.

In his book "", <a href="Nick%20Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a> provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind. He argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit <a href="Instrumental%20convergence">convergent</a> behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI's goals do not reflect humanity's - one example is an AI told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal.

For this danger to be realized, the hypothetical AI would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity, which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching. Other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.

Concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments. In January 2015, <a href="Elon%20Musk">Elon Musk</a> donated ten million dollars to the <a href="Future%20of%20Life%20Institute">Future of Life Institute</a> to fund research on understanding AI decision making. The goal of the institute is to "grow wisdom with which we manage" the growing power of technology. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as <a href="Google%20DeepMind">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href="Vicarious%20%28company%29">Vicarious</a> to "just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. I think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there."

Development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern. Currently, 50+ countries are researching battlefield robots, including the United States, China, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Many people concerned about risk from superintelligent AI also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers.

<a href="Joseph%20Weizenbaum">Joseph Weizenbaum</a> wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as <a href="customer%20service">customer service</a> or <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as <a href="computationalism">computationalism</a>). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.

Martin Ford, author of "The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future", and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications, robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs. Ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems, machine learning and other AI-enhanced applications. AI-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers, making it more feasible to <a href="Outsourcing">outsource</a> <a href="knowledge%20worker">knowledge work</a>.

This raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other AI agents. This issue was addressed by Wendell Wallach in his book titled "Moral Machines" in which he introduced the concept of <a href="Moral%20agency%23Artificial%20moral%20agents">artificial moral agents</a> (AMA). For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as "Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions" and "Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral". For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of "whether" machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the "constraints" which society may place on the development of AMAs.

The field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making. The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics." Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition "Machine Ethics" that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.

Political scientist <a href="Charles%20T.%20Rubin">Charles T. Rubin</a> believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent. He argues that "any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence." Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably, because there is no "a priori" reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind, and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.

Physicist <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> founder <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a>, and <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> founder <a href="Elon%20Musk">Elon Musk</a> have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could evolve to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could "<a href="Global%20catastrophic%20risk">spell the end of the human race</a>".

One proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '<a href="Friendly%20AI">Friendly AI</a>', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.

Leading AI researcher <a href="Rodney%20Brooks">Rodney Brooks</a> writes, "I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence."

If an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be <a href="Sentience">sentient</a> – will it have a <a href="mind">mind</a> which has <a href="consciousness">conscious experiences</a>? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the <a href="hard%20problem%20of%20consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a>.

Computationalism is the position in the <a href="philosophy%20of%20mind">philosophy of mind</a> that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the <a href="mind-body%20problem">mind-body problem</a>. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers <a href="Jerry%20Fodor">Jerry Fodor</a> and <a href="Hilary%20Putnam">Hilary Putnam</a>.

The philosophical position that John Searle has named <a href="strong%20AI%20hypothesis">"strong AI"</a> states: "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds." Searle counters this assertion with his <a href="Chinese%20room">Chinese room</a> argument, which asks us to look "inside" the computer and try to find where the "mind" might be.

<a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>" considers a key issue in the <a href="ethics%20of%20artificial%20intelligence">ethics of artificial intelligence</a>: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also "<a href="sentience">feel</a>"? If it can feel, does it have the same rights as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film "", in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This issue, now known as "<a href="robot%20rights">robot rights</a>", is currently being considered by, for example, California's <a href="Institute%20for%20the%20Future">Institute for the Future</a>, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature. Some critics of <a href="transhumanism">transhumanism</a> argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> and human rights. The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film "<a href="Plug%20%26amp%3B%20Pray">Plug & Pray</a>".

Are there limits to how intelligent machines – or human-machine hybrids – can be? A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. ‘’Superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.

If research into <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">Strong AI</a> produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to <a href="Intelligence%20explosion">recursive self-improvement</a>. The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer <a href="Vernor%20Vinge">Vernor Vinge</a> named this scenario "<a href="technological%20singularity">singularity</a>". Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.

<a href="Ray%20Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> has used <a href="Moore%27s%20law">Moore's law</a> (which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology) to calculate that <a href="desktop%20computer">desktop computer</a>s will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029, and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045.

Robot designer <a href="Hans%20Moravec">Hans Moravec</a>, cyberneticist <a href="Kevin%20Warwick">Kevin Warwick</a> and inventor <a href="Ray%20Kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into <a href="cyborg">cyborg</a>s that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called <a href="transhumanism">transhumanism</a>, which has roots in <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> and <a href="Robert%20Ettinger">Robert Ettinger</a>, has been illustrated in fiction as well, for example in the <a href="manga">manga</a> "<a href="Ghost%20in%20the%20Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a>" and the science-fiction series "<a href="Dune%20%28novel%29">Dune</a>".

In the 1980s artist <a href="Hajime%20Sorayama">Hajime Sorayama</a>'s Sexy Robots series were painted and published in Japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later "the Gynoids" book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a> and other creatives. Sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind, a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form.

<a href="Edward%20Fredkin">Edward Fredkin</a> argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by <a href="Samuel%20Butler%20%28novelist%29">Samuel Butler</a>'s "<a href="Darwin%20among%20the%20Machines">Darwin among the Machines</a>" (1863), and expanded upon by <a href="George%20Dyson%20%28science%20historian%29">George Dyson</a> in his book of the same name in 1998.

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity.

The implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> since the twentieth century. Early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots. The word "robot" itself was coined by <a href="Karel%20%C4%8Capek">Karel Čapek</a> in his 1921 play "<a href="R.U.R.">R.U.R.</a>", the title standing for "<a href="Rossum%27s%20Universal%20Robots">Rossum's Universal Robots</a>". Later, the SF writer <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> developed the <a href="Three%20Laws%20of%20Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a> which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories. Asimov's laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.

The novel "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>", by <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, tells a science fiction story about Androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world. Elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box, mood organ, and the androids themselves. Throughout the novel, Dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.

Nowadays AI is firmly rooted in popular culture; intelligent robots appear in innumerable works. <a href="HAL%209000">HAL</a>, the murderous computer in charge of the spaceship in "" (1968), is an example of the common "robotic rampage" archetype in science fiction movies. "<a href="The%20Terminator">The Terminator</a>" (1984) and "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>" (1999) provide additional widely familiar examples. In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20Earth%20Stood%20Still">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>" (1951) and Bishop from "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.

Afro Celt Sound System

Their albums have been released through <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>'s <a href="Real%20World%20Records">Real World Records</a>, and they have frequently performed at <a href="WOMAD">WOMAD</a> festivals worldwide. Their sales on the label are exceeded only by Gabriel himself. Their recording contract with Real World was for five albums, of which "Volume 5: Anatomic" was the last.
After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD), releasing a re-mastered retrospective titled "Capture."

On 20 May 2014 Afro Celt Sound System announced the upcoming release of a new album, "Born". In January 2016, a posting to that website revealed that due to a dispute with Emmerson, who announced his departure from the band in 2015, there were two active versions of the band, a version led by Emmerson and a separate line-up headed by <a href="James%20McNally%20%28musician%29">James McNally</a> and <a href="Martin%20Russell">Martin Russell</a>. Emmerson's version of the band released the album "The Source" in 2016.

The dispute ended on December 21, 2016, with an announcement on social media.

The inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991, when Simon Emmerson, a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>-nominated British <a href="Record%20producer">producer</a> and guitarist, collaborated with Afro-pop star <a href="Baaba%20Maal">Baaba Maal</a>. While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician <a href="Davy%20Spillane">Davy Spillane</a> told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries' musical affinities.

In an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought two members of Baaba Maal's band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat. "People thought I was mad when I touted the idea," Emmerson told Jim Carroll of "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>". "At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary".

Jamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel's recording facilities in <a href="Wiltshire%2C%20England">Wiltshire, England</a>, the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, "", was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System.

"Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work," musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald. "We were strangers who didn't even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language." McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played whistles, keyboards, piano, <a href="bodhran">bodhran</a>, and bamboo flute.

"Sound Magic" has now sold over 300,000 copies. The band performed at festivals, raves, and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and <a href="N%27Faly%20Kouyate">N'Faly Kouyate</a> on vocals, <a href="Kora%20%28instrument%29">kora</a> and <a href="balafon">balafon</a>.

Just as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group's core musicians, 27-year-old <a href="keyboardist">keyboardist</a> <a href="Jo%20Bruce">Jo Bruce</a> (son of <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a> bass player <a href="Jack%20Bruce">Jack Bruce</a>), died suddenly of an <a href="asthma">asthma</a> attack. The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. Then Irish pop star <a href="Sin%C3%A9ad%20O%27Connor">Sinéad O'Connor</a> came to the rescue, collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss. "[O'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful," McNally told Katz. "We had this track we didn't know what to do with. Sinéad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up." So taken was the band with O'Connor's song, "Release," that they used the name for the title of their album. "" hit the music stores in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide.

In 2000 the group was nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (England, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, Guinea, Ireland, France and <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music. "We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we're at home," McNally told Patrick MacDonald of <a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>". "We're breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other's traditions. And it's changed our lives".

In 2001 the group released "", which climbed to number one on Billboard's Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a>, the album also incorporated a heightened African sound. "On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation," Emmerson told the Irish Times's Carroll. "For this one, we wanted to have more African vocals and input than we'd done before." Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the album as "a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music." The single "<a href="When%20You%27re%20Falling">When You're Falling</a>", with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States.

In 2003, for the "<a href="Seed%20%28Afro%20Celt%20Sound%20System%20album%29">Seed</a>" album, they temporarily changed their name to the simpler Afrocelts; this was subsequently regarded as a mistake, and they reverted to the longer and more familiar band name for their subsequent albums, "<a href="Pod%20%28Afro%20Celt%20Sound%20System%20album%29">Pod</a>", a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, "" (their fifth studio album), and "<a href="Capture%20-%20Afro%20Celt%20Sound%20System%201995-2010">Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010</a>".

They played a number of shows to promote "Volume 5: Anatomic" in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea, before taking an extended break to work on side projects, amongst them "<a href="The%20Imagined%20Village">The Imagined Village</a>" featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi. Starting in the summer of 2010, the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2-CD album, "<a href="Capture%20-%20Afro%20Celt%20Sound%20System%201995-2010">Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010</a>", released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records. Further performances continue to the present day, and a new album-in-progress titled "Born" was announced on their website in 2014.

During the year 2015, the band had split into two formations, one of them including <a href="Simon%20Emmerson">Simon Emmerson</a>, <a href="N%27Faly%20Kouyate">N'Faly Kouyate</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Kalsi">Johnny Kalsi</a>, the other one <a href="James%20McNally%20%28musician%29">James McNally</a> and <a href="Martin%20Russell">Martin Russell</a>. The split was announced on the band's website in January 2016. The dispute officially ended with an announcement on social media on December 21, 2016. "Simon Emmerson, James McNally and Martin Russell are pleased to announce that they have been able to set aside their differences and come to an amicable agreement to bring their dispute to an end. Going forward, McNally, Russell and Emmerson have agreed that Emmerson will continue to perform as Afro Celt Sound System and McNally and Russell will work under a new name to be announced in due course.
While McNally, Russell and Emmerson will no longer be performing or working together they recognise, and are grateful for each other's contribution to Afro Celt Sound System over the past two decades and will be working with the extensive community of musicians that make up the long standing Afro Celt Sound System family."

When Afro Celt Sound System began their musical journey in the mid-1990s during the <a href="Real%20World%20Records">Real World</a> Recording Week, the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non-existent. However, over time, a combination of people became most often associated with the name Afro Celt Sound System (while "Volume 5: Anatomic" only lists Emmerson, McNally, Ó Lionáird and Russell as regulars). The divided grouping of the band into two versions, both operating under the name Afro Celt Sound System, began in January 2016 and was resolved in December 2016 after McNally and Russell agreed to work under a different name from Emmerson.

Ancient philosophy

This page lists some links to ancient philosophy. In <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>, the spread of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> marked the ending of <a href="Hellenistic%20philosophy">Hellenistic philosophy</a> and ushered in the beginnings of <a href="Medieval%20philosophy">Medieval philosophy</a>, whereas in <a href="Eastern%20philosophy">Eastern philosophy</a>, the <a href="spread%20of%20Islam">spread of Islam</a> through the <a href="Caliphate">Arab Empire</a> marked the end of <a href="%23Ancient%20Iranian%20philosophy">Old Iranian philosophy</a> and ushered in the beginnings of <a href="early%20Islamic%20philosophy">early Islamic philosophy</a>.

Genuinely philosophical thought, depending upon original individual insights, arose in many cultures roughly contemporaneously. <a href="Karl%20Jaspers">Karl Jaspers</a> termed the intense period of philosophical development beginning around the 7th century and concluding around the 3rd century BCE an <a href="Axial%20Age">Axial Age</a> in human thought.

Chinese philosophy is the dominant philosophical thought in China and other countries within the <a href="East%20Asian%20cultural%20sphere">East Asian cultural sphere</a> that <a href="Adoption%20of%20Chinese%20literary%20culture">share a common language</a>, including Japan, <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.

The Hundred Schools of Thought were philosophers and schools that flourished from the 6th century to 221 BCE, an era of great cultural and intellectual expansion in China. Even though this period – known in its earlier part as the <a href="Spring%20and%20Autumn%20period%20period">Spring and Autumn period period</a> and the <a href="Warring%20States">Warring States</a> period – in its latter part was fraught with chaos and bloody battles, it is also known as the Golden Age of <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">Chinese philosophy</a> because a broad range of thoughts and ideas were developed and discussed freely. The thoughts and ideas discussed and refined during this period have profoundly influenced <a href="lifestyle%20%28sociology%29">lifestyle</a>s and <a href="social%20consciousness">social consciousness</a> up to the present day in East Asian countries. The <a href="intellectual">intellectual</a> society of this era was characterized by itinerant scholars, who were often employed by various state rulers as advisers on the methods of <a href="Forms%20of%20government">government</a>, <a href="war">war</a>, and <a href="diplomacy">diplomacy</a>. This period ended with the rise of the <a href="Qin%20Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> and the subsequent <a href="Burning%20of%20books%20and%20burying%20of%20scholars">purge</a> of dissent. The <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Han">pageRank.Book of Han</a> lists ten major schools, they are:

The founder of the <a href="Qin%20Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a>, who implemented Legalism as the official philosophy, <a href="To%20burn%20the%20classics%20and%20to%20bury%20the%20scholars">quashed Mohist and Confucianist schools</a>. Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.

Confucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest <a href="Intellectual">thinker</a> was <a href="Dong%20Zhongshu">Dong Zhongshu</a>, who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination "Old Text") that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.

The 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the "<a href="Xuanxue">Xuanxue</a>" (mysterious learning), also called "Neo-Taoism". The most important philosophers of this movement were <a href="Wang%20Bi">Wang Bi</a>, <a href="Xiang%20Xiu">Xiang Xiu</a> and <a href="Guo%20Xiang">Guo Xiang</a>. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, "ming" and "wuming"). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the <a href="Seven%20Sages%20of%20the%20Bamboo%20Grove">Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove</a>, was the concept of "<a href="feng%20liu">feng liu</a>" (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.

<a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the <a href="Southern%20and%20Northern%20Dynasties">Northern and Southern</a>, <a href="Sui%20Dynasty">Sui</a> and <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang</a> Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>, founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>. <a href="Mahayana%20Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> was far more successful in China than its rival <a href="Hinayana">Hinayana</a>, and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were <a href="Sengzhao">Sengzhao</a> and <a href="Daosheng">Daosheng</a>. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the <a href="Chan%20Buddhism">Chan</a> sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the <a href="Zen">Zen</a> sect.

The ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions : <a href="Sramana">Sramana</a> tradition and Vedic tradition.

Indian philosophy begins with the "<a href="Vedas">Vedas</a>" where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. In the famous <a href="Rigveda">Rigvedic</a> "<a href="Hymn%20of%20Creation">Hymn of Creation</a>" (<a href="Nasadiya%20Sukta">Nasadiya Sukta</a>) the poet says:

In the <a href="Historical%20Vedic%20religion">Vedic</a> view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being ("Purusha"). This leads to the inquiry into "the one being" that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things. Cosmic order is termed "rta" and causal law by "karma". Nature ("prakriti") is taken to have three qualities ("<a href="sattva">sattva</a>", "<a href="rajas">rajas</a>", and "<a href="tamas%20%28philosophy%29">tamas</a>").

<a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. <a href="C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka">Cārvāka</a> (Sanskrit: चार्वाक) (atheist) philosophy, also known as Lokāyata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, Cārvāka, author of the Bārhaspatya-sūtras.

In classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy. Some of the questions asked were:

Anaximander

Anaximander (; "Anaximandros"; was a <a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">pre-Socratic</a> <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosopher</a> who lived in <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a>, a city of <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the <a href="Milesian%20school">Milesian school</a> and learned the teachings of his master <a href="Thales">Thales</a>. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted <a href="Anaximenes%20of%20Miletus">Anaximenes</a> and, arguably, <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> amongst his pupils.

Little of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies, although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.

He was an early proponent of <a href="science">science</a> and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular <a href="cosmogony">interest in its origins</a>, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long. Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> included contributions to many disciplines. In <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or <a href="Apeiron%20%28cosmology%29">apeiron</a>) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of <a href="geometry">geometry</a> allowed him to introduce the <a href="gnomon">gnomon</a> in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of <a href="geography">geography</a>. He was also involved in the <a href="politics">politics</a> of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.

Anaximander, son of Praxiades, was born in the third year of the 42nd <a href="Olympiad">Olympiad</a> (610 BC). According to <a href="Apollodorus%20of%20Athens">Apollodorus of Athens</a>, Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547–546 BC), and died shortly afterwards.

Establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. <a href="Themistius">Themistius</a>, a 4th-century <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>ian, mentions that he was the "first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature." Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in <a href="prose">prose</a>, at least in the Western world. By the time of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, his philosophy was almost forgotten, and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, his successor <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> and a few <a href="Doxography">doxographers</a> provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the Monist school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with <a href="Anaximenes%20of%20Miletus">Anaximenes</a>. 3rd-century <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> rhetorician <a href="Claudius%20Aelianus">Aelian</a> depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to <a href="Sozopol">Apollonia</a> on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen. Indeed, "Various History" (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony’s allegiance.

Anaximander's theories were influenced by the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythical</a> tradition, and by some ideas of <a href="Thales">Thales</a> – the father of philosophy – as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East (especially by the Babylonian astrologers). All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, therefore they could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.

Some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new <a href="rationalism">rational</a> way of thought which is the main characteristic of the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">archaic period</a> (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s. This has given rise to the phrase "Greek miracle". But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature (<a href="Water%20%28classical%20element%29">water</a>, <a href="Air%20%28classical%20element%29">air</a>, <a href="Fire%20%28classical%20element%29">fire</a>, <a href="Earth%20%28classical%20element%29">earth</a>) which the first Greek philosophers believed that constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies – <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> (8th – 7th century BC) and <a href="Pherecydes%20of%20Syros">Pherecydes</a> (6th century BC) – <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony, (the <a href="Titans%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not <a href="monarchic">monarchic</a> but <a href="geometric">geometric</a> and this causes the equilibrium of the earth which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature. In this space there is "isonomy" (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The decisions are now taken by the assembly of "<a href="Glossary%20of%20rhetorical%20terms%23Demos">demos</a>" in the "<a href="agora">agora</a>" which is lying in the middle of the city.

The same "rational" way of thought led him to introduce the abstract "<a href="Apeiron%20%28cosmology%29">apeiron</a>" (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original <a href="Chaos%20%28mythology%29">Chaos</a> (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical <a href="Greece">Greek</a> <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a> from which everything else appeared. It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.

The "Refutation" attributed to <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a> (I, 5), and the later 6th century Byzantine philosopher <a href="Simplicius%20of%20Cilicia">Simplicius of Cilicia</a>, attribute to Anaximander the earliest use of the word "apeíron" ( "infinite" or "limitless") to designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term "<a href="Arche">archế</a>" (), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in <a href="Homer">Homer</a> (indefinite sea) and as in <a href="Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a> (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to "apeiron") i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.

Aristotle writes ("<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>", I III 3–4) that the <a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">Pre-Socratics</a> were searching for the element that constitutes all things. While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element (<a href="water%20%28classical%20element%29">water</a> for Thales and <a href="air%20%28classical%20element%29">air</a> for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass ("apeiron"), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived. He proposed the theory of the "apeiron" in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This "arche" is called "eternal and ageless". (Hippolytus (?), "Refutation", I,6,I;DK B2)

For Anaximander, the <a href="Principle%20%28chemistry%29">principle</a> of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth. Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the "apeiron" as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.

Anaximander explains how the <a href="Classical%20element">four elements</a> of ancient physics (<a href="air%20%28classical%20element%29">air</a>, <a href="earth%20%28classical%20element%29">earth</a>, <a href="water%20%28classical%20element%29">water</a> and <a href="fire%20%28classical%20element%29">fire</a>) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Saint Augustine</a>) as a sort of primal <a href="Chaos%20%28cosmogony%29">chaos</a>. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in "all the worlds" (for he believed there were many).

Anaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came ("apeiron"). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter. Simplicius transmitted it as a quotation, which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements:
Whence things have their origin,
Thence also their destruction happens,
According to necessity;
For they give to each other justice and recompense
For their injustice
In conformity with the ordinance of Time.
Simplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these "in poetic terms", meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice (<a href="Dike%20%28mythology%29">Dike</a>) keeps the cosmic order.
This concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle, and by the Greek <a href="Tragedy">tragedian</a> <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>: "what comes from earth must return to earth." <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, in his "<a href="Philosophy%20in%20the%20Tragic%20Age%20of%20the%20Greeks">Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks</a>", stated that Anaximander viewed "... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance." Physicist <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a>, in commenting upon <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>'s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same “primordial substance,”' proposed that this primordial substance be called "apeiron".

Anaximander's bold use of non-<a href="Greek%20mythology">mythological</a> explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> and the origins of <a href="life">life</a>; for this he is often called the "Father of <a href="Cosmology">Cosmology</a>" and founder of astronomy. However, <a href="pseudo-Plutarch">pseudo-Plutarch</a> states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.

Anaximander was the first to conceive a <a href="Mechanics">mechanical</a> model of the <a href="world">world</a>. In his model, the <a href="Earth">Earth</a> floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains "in the same place because of its indifference", a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in "<a href="On%20the%20Heavens">On the Heavens</a>". Its curious shape is that of a <a href="Cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.

Anaximander's realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking. Karl Popper calls this idea "one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking." Such a model allowed the concept that <a href="Astronomical%20object">celestial bodies</a> could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.

At the origin, after the separation of <a href="Temperature">hot and cold</a>, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the <a href="Occultation">occlusion</a> of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the <a href="Moon">lunar</a> wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining <a href="lunar%20phase">lunar phase</a>s. The <a href="star">star</a>s and the <a href="planet">planet</a>s, located closer, followed the same model.

Anaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a <a href="celestial%20spheres">celestial sphere</a>. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the <a href="Axial%20tilt">obliquity</a> of the <a href="Zodiac">Zodiac</a> as the Roman philosopher <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> reports in "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The <a href="doxography">doxographer</a> and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.

According to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the <a href="Cosmic%20pluralism">plurality of worlds</a>, similar to <a href="atomism">atomists</a> <a href="Leucippus">Leucippus</a> and <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>, and later philosopher <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a>. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, "for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction".

In addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within, which are often infinite in quantity). <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.

This theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the <a href="Epicureanism">Epicureans</a> who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the <a href="Timeline%20of%20Western%20philosophers%23Classical%20philosophers">timeline of the Greek history of thought</a>, some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, <a href="Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a> and <a href="Archelaus%20%28philosopher%29">Archelaus</a>), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous (Anaximenes, Heraclitus, <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> and <a href="Diogenes%20Apolloniates">Diogenes</a>).

Anaximander attributed some phenomena, such as <a href="thunder">thunder</a> and <a href="lightning">lightning</a>, to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes. In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.

He saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth. A part of that mass evaporated under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant. He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun. For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's "<a href="Meteorology%20%28Aristotle%29">Meteorology</a>" (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.

Anaximander speculated about the beginnings and <a href="Evolution">origin</a> of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils , he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break. As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer <a href="Censorinus">Censorinus</a> reports:

Anaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales. He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.

Both <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> and <a href="Agathemerus">Agathemerus</a> (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a>, Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian <a href="Hecataeus%20of%20Miletus">Hecataeus of Miletus</a> to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after <a href="Homer">Homer</a>.

Maps were produced in ancient times, also notably in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet <a href="Babylonian%20Map%20of%20the%20World">BM 92687</a> later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.

Such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons. First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a>'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, <a href="Thales">Thales</a> would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian <a href="Polis">city-states</a> to join in a federation in order to push the <a href="Medes">Median</a> threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.

Surely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or “navel” of the world ( "omphalós gẽs") could have been <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. <a href="Europe">Europe</a> was bordered on the south by the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and was separated from <a href="Asia">Asia</a> by the Black Sea, the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Lake Maeotis</a>, and, further east, either by the <a href="Rioni%20River">Phasis River</a> (now called the Rioni) or the <a href="Tanais">Tanais</a>. The <a href="Nile">Nile</a> flowed south into the ocean, separating <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> (which was the name for the part of the then-known <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n continent) from Asia.

The "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>" relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> of the gnomon. In <a href="Lacedaemon">Lacedaemon</a>, he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of <a href="sundial">sundial</a>s to indicate <a href="solstice">solstice</a>s and <a href="equinox">equinox</a>es. Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.

In his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip’s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.

The invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>ns. It is they, according to <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>' <a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">Histories</a> (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the "Suda" seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.

In his philosophical work <a href="De%20Divinatione">De Divinatione</a> (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of <a href="Lacedaemon">Lacedaemon</a> to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near. The city collapsed when the top of the <a href="Taygetus">Taygetus</a> split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an "admirable inspiration", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.

<a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> in the "<a href="History%20of%20Western%20Philosophy%20%28Russell%29">History of Western Philosophy</a>" interprets Anaximander's theories as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist. His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate.

<a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, in "<a href="Philosophy%20in%20the%20Tragic%20Age%20of%20the%20Greeks">Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks</a>", claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed "...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance". ("Ibid.", § 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.

<a href="Martin%20Heidegger">Martin Heidegger</a> lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled "Anaximander's Saying" which was subsequently included in "Off the Beaten Track". The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or "<a href="Dasein">Dasein</a>" in the context of the Anaximander fragment. Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher <a href="Jacques%20Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a>.

Etymologically, "architect" derives from the Latin "architectus", which derives from the Greek ("arkhi-", chief + "tekton", builder), i.e., chief builder.

Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a "practicum" (or "internship") for practical experience to earn a <a href="Profession">license</a> to practice <a href="architecture">architecture</a>. Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction (see below).

The terms architect and architecture are also used in the disciplines of <a href="landscape%20architecture">landscape architecture</a>, <a href="naval%20architecture">naval architecture</a>, and often <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> (for example a network architect or <a href="software%20architect">software architect</a>). In most jurisdictions, the professional and commercial uses of the terms "architect" and "landscape architect" are legally protected.

Throughout ancient and medieval history, most architectural design and construction was carried out by <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s—such as stone <a href="masonry">mason</a>s and <a href="carpenter">carpenter</a>s, rising to the role of master builder. Until modern times, there was no clear distinction between architect and <a href="Civil%20engineering">engineer</a>. In Europe, the titles "architect" and "engineer" were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.

It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional 'gentleman' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600. The availability of both allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals. Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas. However, the development was gradual. Until the 18th-century, buildings continued to be designed and set out by craftsmen with the exception of high-status projects.

In most developed countries, only qualified people with appropriate license, certification, or registration with a relevant body, often governmental may legally practice architecture. Such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as "<a href="architectural%20designer">architectural designer</a>" are not legally protected.

To practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term "<a href="building%20design">building design</a> professional" (or "Design professional)", by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as <a href="engineering">engineering</a> professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as "<a href="architectural%20technologist">architectural technologist</a>s" and "<a href="intern%20architect">intern architect</a>s". In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.

In the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design and construction management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. However, design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. <a href="Structural%20engineer">Structural</a>, <a href="mechanical%20engineer">mechanical</a>, and <a href="electrical%20engineer">electrical engineer</a>s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.

The architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. Often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning, entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief. The program or brief is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner — it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.

It is generally expected that the design proposal(s) is both imaginative as well as pragmatic, but the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary, depending on the place, time, finance, culture, and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place.

Design buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking, no matter what the scale of the project might be. A strong degree of foresight is a prerequisite. Any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables which include qualities of space(s), the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations, and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of <a href="mathematics%20and%20architecture">mathematics and architecture</a>, new or current <a href="architectural%20theory">architectural theory</a>, or references to <a href="architectural%20history">architectural history</a>.

A key part of design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM (Building Information Management), CAD, and cloud-based technologies.

At all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design.

Architects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and <a href="building%20code">building code</a>s. The architect might need to comply with local <a href="Urban%20planning">planning</a> and <a href="zoning">zoning</a> laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and <a href="land%20use">land use</a>. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and <a href="historic%20preservation">historic preservation</a> guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.

Previously, architects employed drawings to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects, computer technology has now become the industry standard. However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, and other media in design production. 
Increasingly, computer software such as <a href="BIM">BIM</a> is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building's design, construction and maintenance.

As current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use.
However, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future.

As the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.

Depending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable <a href="design-build">design-build</a> functions).

Architects typically put projects to <a href="Call%20for%20bids">tender</a> on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a <a href="general%20contractor">general contractor</a>, facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.

In most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.

The architect will typically review contractor <a href="shop%20drawings">shop drawings</a> and other <a href="Submittals%20%28construction%29">submittals</a>, prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also <a href="Design-bid-build">Design-bid-build</a>) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and other countries, a <a href="quantity%20surveyor">quantity surveyor</a> is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent <a href="Construction%20management">construction manager</a> is sometimes hired to assist in design and to manage construction.

In many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.

Recent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as building code, <a href="building%20envelope">building envelope</a>, <a href="Sustainable%20architecture">sustainable design</a>, <a href="technical%20writing">technical writing</a>, historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), <a href="accessibility">accessibility</a> and other forms of specialist consultants.

Many architects elect to move into <a href="real%20estate%20development">real estate (property) development</a>, corporate facilities planning, <a href="project%20management">project management</a>, construction management, <a href="interior%20design">interior design</a>, or other related fields.

Although there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.

Educational requirements generally consist of a <a href="university%20degree">university degree</a> in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.

Professionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, <a href="engineer">engineer</a>s and often <a href="artist">artist</a>s, and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of <a href="master%20builder%20%28occupation%29">master builder</a> or <a href="wikt%3Asurveyor">surveyor</a> after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.

According to the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a>, titles and job descriptions within American architectural offices might be as follows:

Architects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.

Overall billings for <a href="architectural%20firm">architectural firm</a>s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner, or shareholder, etc.), and the size and location of the firm.

A number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.

A wide variety of <a href="List%20of%20architecture%20prizes">prizes</a> is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures, and professional careers.

The most lucrative award an architect can receive is the <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a>, sometimes termed the "<a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> for architecture." Other prestigious architectural awards are the <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a>, the <a href="AIA%20Gold%20Medal">AIA Gold Medal</a> (USA), AIA Gold Medal (Australia), and the <a href="Praemium%20Imperiale">Praemium Imperiale</a>.

Architects in the UK, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> and can write <a href="FRIBA">FRIBA</a> after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA. Architects in the US, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects and can write <a href="FAIA">FAIA</a> after their name. Architects in Canada, who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service, or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Architectural%20Institute%20of%20Canada">Royal Architectural Institute of Canada</a> and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made special contribution after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), may be elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.

Architects in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="Overseas%20Filipinos">Filipino communities overseas</a> (whether they are Filipinos or not), especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as "Architect", rather than "Sir/Madam" in speech or "Mr./Mrs./Ms." ("G./Gng./Bb." in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.

Abbreviation

An abbreviation (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "brevis", meaning "short") is a shortened form of a word or phrase. It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word "abbreviation" can itself be represented by the abbreviation "abbr.", "abbrv.", or "abbrev."

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with <a href="Contraction%20%28grammar%29">contractions</a>, <a href="crasis">crasis</a>, <a href="acronym">acronym</a>s, or <a href="initialism">initialism</a>s, with which they share some <a href="semantic">semantic</a> and <a href="phonetic">phonetic</a> functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or <a href="syllable">syllable</a>s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the <a href="Council%20of%20Science%20Editors">Council of Science Editors</a>). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, the reduction of words to single letters was common. In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, "A" can be an abbreviation for many words, such as "ager", "amicus", "annus", "as", "Aulus", "Aurelius", "aurum" and "avus".)"

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the <a href="old%20English">old English</a> poem <a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a> used many abbreviations, for example "7" or "&" for "and", and "y" for "since", so that "not much space is wasted". The standardisation of <a href="English%20language">English</a> in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations. At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for "master" and ‹exacɔbate› for "exacerbate". While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:

The <a href="Early%20Modern%20English">Early Modern English</a> period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like "y" for "Þ", used for the word "the": "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."

During the growth of <a href="philology">philological</a> linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and his friend <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, and other members of the <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> literary group known as the <a href="Inklings">Inklings</a>, are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this. Likewise, a century earlier in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term <a href="Okay">OK</a> generally credited as a remnant of its influence.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the British greatly reduced the use of the <a href="full%20stop">full stop</a> and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "<a href="Special%20Operations%2C%20Executive">Special Operations, Executive</a>"—"S.O.,E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In <a href="French%20language">French</a>, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is "not" the last letter of its antecedent: "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-<a href="English%20Channel">channel</a> linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> (PC) or <a href="television">television</a> (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film <a href="IBM%20Selectric%20typewriter%23Ribbons">ribbons</a> since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through <a href="Mobile%20phone%23Mobile%20phones%20in%20society">mobile phones</a> and <a href="Internet%23Social%20impact">the Internet</a> during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as <a href="Instant%20messaging">instant-</a> and <a href="text%20messaging">text messaging</a>. <a href="Short%20Message%20Service">SMS</a>, for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the <a href="GSM%2003.38">GSM 03.38</a> character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called <a href="SMS%20language">Textese</a>, with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated. More recently <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, a popular <a href="social%20networking%20service">social networking service</a>, began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

In <a href="modern%20English">modern English</a>, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be "consistent", and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a <a href="style%20guide">style guide</a>. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for "Leviticus". When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for "year-to-date", PCB for "printed circuit board" and FYI for "for your information". However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to <a href="Hart%27s%20Rules">Hart's Rules</a>, the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions. <a href="Fowler%27s%20Modern%20English%20Usage">Fowler's Modern English Usage</a> says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.

In <a href="American%20English">American English</a>, the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. "Dr." or "Mrs.". In some cases, periods are optional, as in either "US" or "U.S." for "United States", "EU" or "E.U." for "European Union", and "UN" or "U.N." for "United Nations". There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are <a href="sonar">sonar</a>, <a href="radar">radar</a>, <a href="lidar">lidar</a>, <a href="laser">laser</a>, <a href="List%20of%20military%20slang%20terms%23SNAFU">snafu</a>, and <a href="Scuba%20set">scuba</a>.

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U. S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: "The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C".

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the <a href="Modern%20Language%20Association">Modern Language Association</a> explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation". Also, the <a href="American%20Psychological%20Association">American Psychological Association</a> specifically says, "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for the <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of <a href="run%20batted%20in">run batted in</a>, simply add an s to the end of RBI.


For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase "s" to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, "Hart's Rules" recommends putting the "s" after the final one.
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:

According to "Hart's Rules", an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of "<a href="The%20Chicago%20Manual%20of%20Style">The Chicago Manual of Style</a>" and the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. The <a href="U.S.%20Government">U.S. Government</a> follows a style guide published by the <a href="U.S.%20Government%20Printing%20Office">U.S. Government Printing Office</a>. The <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> sets the style for abbreviations of units.

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:


Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure. Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "<a href="inch">inch</a>" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "<a href="kilometre">kilometre</a>".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in <a href="Afrikaans%20language">Afrikaans</a> for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim". Since both "in" and "dm" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process" applies the appropriate shorthand by "substitution" rather than by "contraction". Since the shorthand for kilometre ("" in Portuguese or "" in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a <a href="logogram">logogram</a> rather than an abbreviation.

In the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI) manual the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">defines the way in which units should be written</a>, the principal rules being:

A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as "<a href="Interpol">Interpol</a>" = International" + police". It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using <a href="lower%20case">lower case</a>, sometimes starting with a <a href="capital%20letter">capital letter</a>, and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a>s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. The <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, however, often uses syllabic abbreviations, as described below, and some <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a> government ministries such as <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> (Office of Communications") and <a href="Oftel">Oftel</a> (Office of Telecommunications") use this style.

<a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as <a href="Tribeca">Tribeca</a> (Triangle below Canal Street") and <a href="SoHo">SoHo</a> (South of Houston Street"). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving <a href="South%20of%20Market%2C%20San%20Francisco">SoMa</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> (South of Market") and <a href="LoDo%2C%20Denver">LoDo</a>, <a href="Denver">Denver</a> (Lower Downtown"), among others. <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a> is often abbreviated as NOLA, while <a href="Northern%20Virginia">Northern Virginia</a> is known as NOVA.

On the other hand, they prevailed in Germany under the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a> and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, "<a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>" stands for Geheime Staats-Polizei", or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the "<a href="Comintern">Comintern</a>" ("Communist International") and "<a href="Komsomol">Komsomol</a>" (Kommunisticheskii Soyuz Molodyozhi", or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries, (as in Orwell's <a href="Newspeak">Newspeak</a>), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., "" for "Schutzpolizei", and are still used, e.g. "" for "".

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the <a href="German%20language">German language</a> used in the <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">German Democratic Republic</a>, e.g. "<a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>" for Staatssicherheit" ("state security", the secret police) or "Vopo" for "Volkspolizist" ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as <a href="Aldi">Aldi</a>, from the name of the founder, Theo Albrecht, and the German word Diskont" (discount) or <a href="Haribo">Haribo</a>, from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, Hans Riegl Bonn.

Syllabic abbreviations are "de rigueur" in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as <a href="Pemex">Pemex</a> for Petróleos Mexicanos" ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for Fondo Nacional de Financimiento Forestal" (National Forestry Financing Fund).

East Asian languages whose writing systems use <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a> form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase. For example, in <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> the term for the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, "kokusai rengō" (国際連合) is often abbreviated to "kokuren" (国連). (Such abbreviations are called (略語) in <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>; see also <a href="Japanese%20abbreviated%20and%20contracted%20words">Japanese abbreviated and contracted words</a>). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, "Běidà" (北大) for "Běijīng Dàxué" (北京大学, <a href="Peking%20University">Peking University</a>) and "Tōdai" (東大) for "Tōkyō daigaku" (東京大学, <a href="University%20of%20Tokyo">University of Tokyo</a>). The English phrase "<a href="%3Awikt%3Agung%20ho">Gung ho</a>" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence "<a href="DESRON">DESRON</a> 6" is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while "<a href="COMNAVAIRLANT">COMNAVAIRLANT</a>" would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

Aphrodite

Aphrodite ( ; "Aphrodite") is the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> <a href="goddess">goddess</a> of <a href="love">love</a>, <a href="beauty">beauty</a>, <a href="pleasure">pleasure</a>, and <a href="procreation">procreation</a>. She is identified with the planet <a href="Venus">Venus</a>; her <a href="Roman%20equivalent">Roman equivalent</a> is the goddess . <a href="Myrtle%20%28plant%29">Myrtle</a>, roses, <a href="dove">dove</a>s, <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a>s and <a href="swan">swan</a>s were sacred to her. 

In <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>", Aphrodite was created from the sea foam ("aphros") produced by <a href="Uranus%20%28mythology%29">Uranus</a>'s genitals, which had been severed by <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a>.
In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", however, she is the daughter of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Dione%20%28Titaness/Oceanid%29">Dione</a>. In <a href="Plato">Plato</a> ("Symposium", 180e), these two origins are said to be of hitherto separate entities: <a href="Aphrodite%20Urania">Aphrodite Ourania</a> (a transcendent, "Heavenly" Aphrodite) and <a href="Aphrodite%20Pandemos">Aphrodite Pandemos</a> (Aphrodite common to "all the people"). She had many other names, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as Cytherea ("Lady of <a href="Kythira">Cythera</a>") and Cypris ("Lady of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>"), both of which claimed to be her place of birth. 

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the other gods feared that Aphrodite's beauty might lead to conflict and war, through rivalry for her favours; so Zeus married her off to <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>. Despite this, Aphrodite followed her own inclinations, and had many lovers — both gods, such as <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, and men, such as <a href="Anchises">Anchises</a>. She played a role in the <a href="Eros%20and%20Psyche">Eros and Psyche</a> legend, and was both lover and surrogate mother of <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>.

<a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> derives "Aphrodite" from "aphrós" (ἀφρός) "sea-foam", interpreting the name as "risen from the foam". Michael Janda, accepting this as genuine, claims the story of a birth from the foam as an <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20mythology">Indo-European</a> <a href="mytheme">mytheme</a>. The second part of the compound has been variously analyzed as *"-odítē" "wanderer" or *"-dítē" "bright". Janda, agreeing with the latter, interprets the meaning of the name as "she who shines from the foam (of the ocean)", supposing the name as an epithet of <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, the <a href="Hausos">dawn goddess</a>. Likewise, Witczak proposes an Indo-European compound ' "very" and ' "to shine", also referring to Eos. Other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since Aphrodite's attributes are entirely different from those of both Eos and the <a href="Vedic%20deity">Vedic deity</a> <a href="Ushas">Ushas</a>. Janda disputes this assumption.

A number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian "barīrītu", the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. Hammarström looks to <a href="Etruscan%20language">Etruscan</a>, comparing "(e)prϑni" "lord", an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as <a href="Prytaneis">πρύτανις</a>. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, "the lady". <a href="Hjalmar%20Frisk">Hjalmar Frisk</a> and <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">Robert Beekes</a> reject this etymology as implausible, especially since Aphrodite actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form "Apru" (from Greek "Aphrō", clipped form of "Aphrodite").

The medieval "<a href="Etymologicum%20Magnum">Etymologicum Magnum</a>" (c. 1150) offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving "Aphrodite" from the compound "habrodíaitos" (), "she who lives delicately", from "habrós" and "díaita". The alteration from "b" to "ph" is explained as a "familiar" characteristic of Greek "obvious from the <a href="Ancient%20Macedonian%20language">Macedonians</a>", despite the fact that the name cannot be of Macedonian origin.

The cult of Aphrodite in Greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a> in <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>, which, in turn, was derived from the cult of the Babylonian goddess <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, which itself was largely derived from the cult of the Sumerian goddess <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a>. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Assyrians</a>, after the Assyrians, the <a href="Paphos">Paphians</a> of Cyprus, and then the Phoenicians at <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of <a href="Cythera%20%28island%29">Cythera</a>.

Classical nineteenth-century scholars viewed the notion of a Near Eastern origin for Aphrodite with skepticism. Authors such as A. Enmann ("Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes" 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development. Scholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to <a href="Walter%20Burkert">Walter Burkert</a> (1984). The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of <a href="Orientalizing%20period">orientalization</a> during the eighth century BC, when <a href="archaic%20Greece">archaic Greece</a> was on the fringes of the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Neo-Assyrian Empire</a>.

Hans Georg Wunderlich has drawn a connection between Aphrodite and the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> <a href="Snake%20Goddess">snake goddess</a>. This theory is supported by the fact that the Egyptian snake goddess <a href="Wadjet">Wadjet</a> was associated with the city known to the Greeks as "Aphroditopolis", which means "City of Aphrodite."

In native Greek tradition, the planet Venus had two names: "Hesperos" as the evening star and "Eosphoros" as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening stars, as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite, during the 4th century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology, such as the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> (<a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>).

The ancient Greeks also identified Aphrodite with the ancient Egyptian goddess <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>.

It has long been accepted in <a href="comparative%20mythology">comparative mythology</a> that Aphrodite preserves some aspects of the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20religion">Indo-European</a> dawn goddess <a href="Hausos">*"Héusōs"</a> (properly Greek <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, Latin <a href="Aurora%20%28mythology%29">Aurora</a>, Sanskrit <a href="Ushas">Ushas</a>). Janda etymologizes her name as "she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]" and points to Hesiod's "Theogony" account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the <a href="Rig%20Veda">Rigvedic</a> myth of <a href="Indra">Indra</a> defeating <a href="Vrtra">Vrtra</a>, liberating <a href="Ushas">Ushas</a>.

By the late 5th century BC, <a href="Platonism">Platonists</a> distinguished two separate "Aphrodites". "<a href="Aphrodite%20Ourania">Aphrodite Ourania</a>", the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, was thought the older form; she also inspired homosexual male desire or, more specifically, <a href="Ephebic%20Oath">ephebic</a> <a href="Eros%20%28concept%29">eros</a>. The "younger" "<a href="Aphrodite%20Pandemos">Aphrodite Pandemos</a>", the common Aphrodite "of all the folk", born from the union of Zeus and Dione, inspired all love for women.

Among the <a href="neo-Platonist">neo-Platonist</a>s and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it was the subject of a <a href="chryselephantine">chryselephantine</a> sculpture by <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a> for <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>).

She was also called "Kypris" or "Cytherea" after her birth-places in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and <a href="Cythera%20%28island%29">Cythera</a>, respectively, both centers of her cult. She was associated with <a href="Hesperides">Hesperia</a> and frequently accompanied by the <a href="Oread">Oread</a>s, <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s of the mountains. She was also often depicted with the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a>s, sceptres, apples, <a href="Myrtus">myrtle</a>, rose trees, <a href="lime%20%28fruit%29">lime</a> trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.

Her festival, "<a href="Aphrodisia">Aphrodisia</a>", was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of <a href="Acrocorinth">Acrocorinth</a> (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC), intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was re-established under Roman rule in 44 BC, but the fertility rituals likely continued in the main city near the agora.

<a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as "Areia", which means "warlike." This epithet stresses Aphrodite's connections to Ares, with whom she had extramarital relations. Pausanias also records that, in Sparta and on Cythera, there were extremely ancient cult statues of Aphrodite portraying her bearing arms.

The cult of Aphrodite may have involved <a href="ritual%20prostitution">ritual prostitution</a>. The Greek euphemism for a sacred prostitute is "<a href="hierodoule">hierodoule</a>", meaning "sacred slave". Ritual prostitution is attested in association with Aphrodite in <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a> and on the islands of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Cythera">Cythera</a>, and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, but it is not attested in Athens. Ritual prostitution was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite's Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a> and Akkadian <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, whose temple priestesses were the "women of Ishtar," "ishtaritum". Ritual prostitution has been documented in Babylon, Syria, and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyrian</a> colony <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the "<a href="hetaera">hetaera</a>" and <a href="courtesan">courtesan</a>. In <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> on the coast of Asia Minor, "hierodoulai" served in the <a href="temple%20of%20Artemis">temple of Artemis</a>.

As one of the Twelve Olympians of the Greek pantheon and thus a major deity, worship of Aphrodite or "Aphrodíti" as a living goddess is one of the more prominent devotionals in "<a href="Hellenismos">Hellenismos</a>" (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism), the revival of ancient Greek religious practices in the present day.

Hellenic polytheists of today celebrate their religious devotion to Aphrodite on two annual and monthly festival days. Aphrodisia is her main festival day, which is celebrated on the 4th day of "Hekatombaion" in the <a href="Attic%20calendar">Attic calendar</a>, falling in the months of July and August in the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, depending on the year. Adonia, a joint festival of Aphrodite and her partner Adonis, is celebrated on the first <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a> following the <a href="Northern%20spring%20equinox">Northern spring equinox</a>, often roughly as the same week the Christian festival of <a href="Easter">Easter</a> is celebrated. The fourth day of each month is considered a sacred day of both Aphrodite and her son Eros.

Devotional offerings to Aphrodite can include incense, fruit (particularly apples and pomegranates), flowers (particularly fragrant roses), sweet dessert wine (particularly "Commandaria" wine from <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>), and cakes made with honey.

Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a>, on the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, which is why she is sometimes called "Cyprian", especially in the poetic works of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of <a href="Cythera%20%28island%29">Cythera</a>, hence another of her names, "Cytherea". Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponesus</a>, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite's cult from the <a href="Levant">Middle East</a> to mainland <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

According to the version of her birth recounted by <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> in his "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>", <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a> severed <a href="Uranus%20%28mythology%29">Uranus'</a> genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, meaning "foam-arisen"), while the <a href="Giants%20%28Greek%20mythology%29">Giants</a>, the <a href="Erinyes">Erinyes</a> (furies), and the <a href="Meliae">Meliae</a> emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals "were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew." The girl, Aphrodite, floated ashore on a <a href="scallop">scallop</a> shell. This iconic representation of Aphrodite as a mature "Venus rising from the sea" ("<a href="Venus%20Anadyomene">Venus Anadyomene</a>") was made famous in a much-admired painting by <a href="Apelles">Apelles</a>, now lost, but described in the "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>.

According to the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", Aphrodite was considered a daughter of Zeus and Dione, the mother goddess whose oracle was at <a href="Dodona">Dodona</a>.

Aphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult, having had no childhood. She is often depicted nude. In many of the later myths, she is portrayed as vain, ill-tempered, and easily offended. Although she is married—she is one of the few gods in the <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20characters">Greek Pantheon</a> who is—she is frequently unfaithful to her husband.

According to one version of Aphrodite's story, because of her immense beauty Zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her. To forestall this, he forces her to marry <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of the story, his mother, <a href="Hera">Hera</a> casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite's hand in marriage.

Hephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forges her beautiful jewelry, including a "<a href="History%20of%20bras%23Greece">strophion</a>" known as the "kestos imas", a saltire-shaped undergarment (usually translated as "girdle"), which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men. Such "strophia" were commonly used in depictions of the Near Eastern goddesses Ishtar and <a href="Atargatis">Atargatis</a>.

Aphrodite is a major figure in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> legend. She is a contestant in the "Judgement of Paris" (see below), which leads to the war. She had been the lover of the Trojan <a href="Anchises">Anchises</a>, and mother of his son <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>. Later, during the war, she saves Aeneas from <a href="Diomedes">Diomedes</a>, who wounds her.

In pageRank.Book Eight of the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", the blind singer <a href="Demodocus%20%28Odyssey%20character%29">Demodocus</a> tells of how Aphrodite committed <a href="adultery">adultery</a> with <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the god of war. The sun-god <a href="Helios">Helios</a> saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers, but <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the <a href="Charites">Charites</a>. This narrative probably originated as a Greek <a href="fairy%20tale">folk tale</a>, originally independent of the "Odyssey".

<a href="Adonis">Adonis</a> was the son of <a href="Myrrha">Myrrha</a>, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King <a href="Cinyras">Cinyras</a> of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a <a href="myrrh">myrrh</a> tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.

Aphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a>. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. Persephone wanted to keep Adonis; Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose Aphrodite, and they remained constantly together.

Adonis, who loved to hunt, was wounded by a wild boar, and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms. As she mourned his death, she caused <a href="anemone">anemone</a>s to grow wherever his blood fell, and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. According to <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a>'s "<a href="De%20Dea%20Syria">De Dea Syria</a>", the river Adonis in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> ran red with blood. The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the Near Eastern legend of Ishtar and <a href="Tammuz%20%28deity%29">Tammuz</a>.

The gods are all invited to the marriage of <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a> and <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> (the eventual parents of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>), except <a href="Eris%20%28mythology%29">Eris</a>, goddess of discord. In revenge, Eris makes a golden <a href="Apple%20of%20Discord">Apple of Discord</a> inscribed "kallistēi" ("to the fairest one"), which she throws among the goddesses. Aphrodite, <a href="Hera">Hera</a>, and <a href="Athena">Athena</a> all claim it.

Zeus delegates the choice to a mortal, Paris. The goddesses offer him bribes. Hera offers him supreme power and Athena offers him wisdom, fame, and glory in battle. Aphrodite offers him <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen of Troy</a>, the most beautiful mortal woman in the world, as a wife. As the goddess of desire, she causes Paris to become inflamed with desire for Helen at first sight, and he awards the Apple of Discord to her. Helen is already married to King <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> of <a href="Sparta%23Prehistory">Sparta</a>. The other two goddesses are enraged by this, and through Helen's abduction by Paris, they bring about the Trojan War.

In one version of <a href="Hippolytus%20%28mythology%29">the legend of Hippolytus</a>, Aphrodite is the cause of his death. He scorned the worship of Aphrodite, preferring <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. Aphrodite caused his stepmother, <a href="Phaedra%20%28mythology%29">Phaedra</a>, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her. This led to Phaedra's suicide, and the death of Hippolytus.

<a href="Glaucus%20%28son%20of%20Sisyphus%29">Glaucus</a> of Corinth angered Aphrodite. During the chariot race at the funeral games of King <a href="Pelias">Pelias</a>, she drove his horses mad and they tore him apart.

<a href="Polyphonte">Polyphonte</a> was a young woman who chose virginal life with Artemis instead of marriage and children, as favoured by Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the whole family were transformed into birds of ill omen.

Antisymmetric relation

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a <a href="binary%20relation">binary relation</a> "R" on a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "X" is anti-symmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of "X" each of which is related by "R" to the other. More formally, "R" is anti-symmetric precisely if for all "a" and "b" in "X"
or, equivalently,

As a simple example, the <a href="divisibility">divisibility</a> order on the <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s is an anti-symmetric relation. In this context, anti-symmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if "n" and "m" are distinct and "n" is a factor of "m", then "m" cannot be a factor of "n".

In <a href="mathematical%20notation">mathematical notation</a>, this is:

or, equivalently,

The usual <a href="order%20relation">order relation</a> ≤ on the <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s is anti-symmetric: if for two real numbers "x" and "y" both <a href="inequality%20%28mathematics%29">inequalities</a> "x" ≤ "y" and "y" ≤ "x" hold then "x" and "y" must be equal. Similarly, the <a href="subset%20order">subset order</a> ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is anti-symmetric: given two sets "A" and "B", if every <a href="Element%20%28mathematics%29">element</a> in "A" also is in "B" and every element in "B" is also in "A", then "A" and "B" must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:

<a href="partial%20order">Partial</a> and <a href="total%20order">total order</a>s are anti-symmetric by definition. A relation can be both <a href="symmetric%20relation">symmetric</a> and anti-symmetric (e.g., <a href="equality%20%28mathematics%29">the equality relation</a>), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric (e.g., the "preys on" relation on biological <a href="species">species</a>).

Anti-symmetry is different from <a href="Asymmetric%20relation">asymmetry</a>, which requires both anti-symmetry and <a href="reflexive%20relation">irreflexivity</a>.

The relation ""x" is even, "y" is odd" between a pair ("x", "y") of <a href="integer">integer</a>s is anti-symmetric:

Aleister Crowley

Aleister Crowley (; born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947) was an English <a href="occult">occult</a>ist, <a href="ceremonial%20magic">ceremonial magic</a>ian, <a href="poetry">poet</a>, <a href="painting">painter</a>, <a href="novelist">novelist</a>, and <a href="mountaineering">mountaineer</a>. He founded the religion of <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a>, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the <a href="Aeon%20%28Thelema%29">Æon of Horus</a> in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.

Born to a wealthy <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a> family in <a href="Royal%20Leamington%20Spa">Royal Leamington Spa</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, Crowley rejected this <a href="Christian%20fundamentalism">fundamentalist Christian</a> faith to pursue an interest in <a href="Western%20esotericism">Western esotericism</a>. He was educated at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a <a href="List%20of%20intelligence%20agencies%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British intelligence agency</a>, further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>, where he was trained in ceremonial magic by <a href="Samuel%20Liddell%20MacGregor%20Mathers">Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers</a> and <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Allan%20Bennett">Allan Bennett</a>. Moving to <a href="Boleskine%20House">Boleskine House</a> by <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a> in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with <a href="Oscar%20Eckenstein">Oscar Eckenstein</a>, before studying <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> practices in India. He married <a href="Rose%20Edith%20Kelly">Rose Edith Kelly</a> and in 1904 they honeymooned in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named <a href="Aiwass">Aiwass</a>, who provided him with "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Law">The pageRank.Book of the Law</a>", a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the Æon of Horus, "The pageRank.Book" declared that its followers should "Do what thou wilt" and seek to align themselves with their <a href="True%20Will">True Will</a> through the practice of <a href="Magick%20%28Thelema%29">magick</a>.

After <a href="1905%20Kanchenjunga%20expedition">an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga</a> and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and <a href="George%20Cecil%20Jones">George Cecil Jones</a> co-founded a Thelemite order, the <a href="A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴</a>, through which they propagated the religion. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Thelema">Abbey of Thelema</a>, a religious commune in <a href="Cefal%C3%B9">Cefalù</a>, Sicily where he lived with various followers. His <a href="libertine">libertine</a> lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.

Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drug experimenter</a>, <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a> and an <a href="Individualism">individualist</a> <a href="social%20criticism">social critic</a>. He was denounced in the popular press as "the wickedest man in the world" and a <a href="Satanist">Satanist</a>. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter-culture, and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema.

Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in <a href="Royal%20Leamington%20Spa">Royal Leamington Spa</a>, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875. His father, Edward Crowley (1834–87), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as "the Beast", a name that he revelled in. The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874, and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a>, but had converted to the <a href="Exclusive%20Brethren">Exclusive Brethren</a>, a faction of a <a href="Christian%20fundamentalist">Christian fundamentalist</a> group known as the <a href="Plymouth%20Brethren">Plymouth Brethren</a>, with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to <a href="Redhill%2C%20Surrey">Redhill</a>, Surrey. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a>, and then to Ebor preparatory school in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.

In March 1887, when Crowley was 11, his father died of <a href="oral%20cancer">tongue cancer</a>. Crowley described this as a turning point in his life, and he always maintained an admiration of his father, describing him as "his hero and his friend". Inheriting a third of his father's wealth, he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney; Crowley's family removed him from the school when he developed <a href="albuminuria">albuminuria</a>. He then attended <a href="Malvern%20College">Malvern College</a> and <a href="Tonbridge%20School">Tonbridge School</a>, both of which he despised and left after a few terms. He became increasingly sceptical regarding Christianity, pointing out <a href="inconsistencies%20in%20the%20Bible">inconsistencies in the Bible</a> to his religious teachers, and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking, masturbating, and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>. Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, he undertook chemistry courses at <a href="Eastbourne%20College">Eastbourne College</a>. Crowley developed interests in <a href="chess">chess</a>, poetry, and <a href="mountain%20climbing">mountain climbing</a>, and in 1894 climbed <a href="Beachy%20Head">Beachy Head</a> before visiting the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and joining the <a href="Scottish%20Mountaineering%20Club">Scottish Mountaineering Club</a>. The following year he returned to the <a href="Bernese%20Alps">Bernese Alps</a>, climbing the <a href="Eiger">Eiger</a>, <a href="Trift%20Glacier">Trift</a>, <a href="Jungfrau">Jungfrau</a>, <a href="M%C3%B6nch">Mönch</a>, and <a href="Wetterhorn">Wetterhorn</a>.

Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward, in October 1895 Crowley began a three-year course at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he was entered for the <a href="Moral%20Science">Moral Science</a> <a href="Tripos">Tripos</a> studying philosophy. With approval from his personal tutor, he changed to English literature, which was not then part of the curriculum offered. Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes, becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player. Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry, particularly the works of <a href="Richard%20Francis%20Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as "<a href="Granta">The Granta</a>", "Cambridge Magazine", and "Cantab". He continued his mountaineering, going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898, often with his friend <a href="Oscar%20Eckenstein">Oscar Eckenstein</a>, and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the <a href="M%C3%B6nch">Mönch</a> without a guide. These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community.

Crowley had his first significant <a href="religious%20experience">mystical experience</a> while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including <a href="Lawrence%20Sutin">Lawrence Sutin</a>, <a href="Richard%20Kaczynski">Richard Kaczynski</a>, and <a href="Tobias%20Churton">Tobias Churton</a>, believed that this was the result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a>. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite <a href="Offences%20against%20the%20Person%20Act%201861%23Unnatural%20offences">their illegality</a>. In October 1897, Crowley met <a href="Herbert%20Charles%20Pollitt">Herbert Charles Pollitt</a>, president of the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Footlights%20Dramatic%20Club">Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club</a>, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a breakup that Crowley would regret for many years.

In 1897, Crowley travelled to <a href="St%20Petersburg">St Petersburg</a> in Russia, later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge.

In October 1897, a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and "the futility of all human endeavour", and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult. In March 1898, he obtained <a href="A.E.%20Waite">A.E. Waite</a>'s "The pageRank.Book of Black Magic and of Pacts" (1898), and then <a href="Karl%20von%20Eckartshausen">Karl von Eckartshausen</a>'s "The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary" (1896), furthering his occult interests.
In 1898 Crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem "Aceldama: A Place to Bury Strangers In", but it was not a particular success. That same year he published a string of other poems, including "<a href="White%20Stains">White Stains</a>", a <a href="Decadent%20movement">Decadent</a> collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities. In July 1898, he left Cambridge, not having taken any degree at all despite a <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">"first class"</a> showing in his 1897 exams and consistent "second class honours" results before that.

In August 1898, Crowley was in <a href="Zermatt">Zermatt</a>, Switzerland, where he met the chemist <a href="Julian%20L.%20Baker">Julian L. Baker</a>, and the two began discussing their common interest in <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>. Back in London, Baker introduced Crowley to <a href="George%20Cecil%20Jones">George Cecil Jones</a>, Baker's brother in-law, and a fellow member of the occult society known as the <a href="Hermetic%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>, which had been founded in 1888. Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group's leader, <a href="Samuel%20Liddell%20MacGregor%20Mathers">Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers</a>. The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn's Isis-Urania Temple held at London's Mark Masons Hall, where Crowley took the magical motto and name "Frater Perdurabo", which he interpreted as "I shall endure to the end". Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley joined the Order under the command of the British secret services to monitor the activities of Mathers, who was known to be a <a href="Carlism">Carlist</a>.

Crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67–69 <a href="Chancery%20Lane">Chancery Lane</a> and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member, <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Allan%20Bennett">Allan Bennett</a>, to live with him as his personal magical tutor. Bennett taught Crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs, and together they performed the rituals of the "<a href="Goetia">Goetia</a>", until Bennett left for South Asia to study <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. In November 1899, Crowley purchased <a href="Boleskine%20House">Boleskine House</a> in <a href="Foyers">Foyers</a> on the shore of <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a> in Scotland. He developed a love of Scottish culture, describing himself as the "Laird of Boleskine", and took to wearing traditional highland dress, even during visits to London. He continued writing poetry, publishing "Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems", "Tales of Archais", "Songs of the Spirit", "Appeal to the American Republic", and "Jephthah" in 1898–99; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics, although "Jephthah" was considered a particular critical success.

Crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn, and was ready to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his bisexuality and <a href="libertine">libertine</a> lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation, and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including <a href="W.B.%20Yeats">W.B. Yeats</a>. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders, Crowley – with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate <a href="Elaine%20Simpson">Elaine Simpson</a> – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in <a href="West%20Kensington">West Kensington</a>, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.

In 1900, Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States, settling in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> and taking a local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a>'s <a href="Enochian">Enochian</a> invocations. He later claimed to have been initiated into <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> while there, and he wrote a play based on <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>" as well as a series of poems, published as "Oracles" (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including <a href="Iztaccihuatl">Iztaccihuatl</a>, <a href="Popocatepetl">Popocatepetl</a>, and <a href="Colima%20%28volcano%29">Colima</a>, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> before sailing for Hawaii aboard the "Nippon Maru". On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he had fallen in love with her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as "Alice: An Adultery" (1903).
Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong, Crowley reached Ceylon, where he met with Allan Bennett, who was there studying <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a>. The pair spent some time in <a href="Kandy">Kandy</a> before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> tradition, travelling to Burma to do so. Crowley decided to tour India, devoting himself to the Hindu practice of "<a href="raja%20yoga">raja yoga</a>", from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of "<a href="Dhyana%20in%20Hinduism">dhyana</a>". He spent much of this time studying at the <a href="Meenakshi%20Amman%20Temple">Meenakshi Amman Temple</a> in <a href="Madurai">Madura</a>. At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as "The Sword of Song" (1904). He contracted <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon. In 1902, he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers: Guy Knowles, H. Pfannl, V. Wesseley, and <a href="Jules%20Jacot-Guillarmod">Jules Jacot-Guillarmod</a>. Together the Eckenstein-Crowley expedition attempted <a href="K2">K2</a>, which had never been climbed. On the journey, Crowley was afflicted with <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, malaria, and <a href="snow%20blindness">snow blindness</a>, and other expedition members were also struck with illness. They reached an altitude of before turning back.

Having arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother-in-law, the painter <a href="Gerald%20Festus%20Kelly">Gerald Kelly</a>, and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene. Whilst there, Crowley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance, the sculptor <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>. These poems were later published as "Rodin in Rime" (1907). One of those frequenting this milieu was <a href="W.%20Somerset%20Maugham">W. Somerset Maugham</a>, who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of <a href="Oliver%20Haddo">Oliver Haddo</a> in his novel "<a href="The%20Magician%20%28Maugham%20novel%29">The Magician</a>" (1908). Returning to Boleskine in April 1903, in August Crowley wed Gerald's sister <a href="Rose%20Edith%20Kelly">Rose Edith Kelly</a> in a "marriage of convenience" to prevent her entering an <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged marriage</a>; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald. Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections. While on his honeymoon, he wrote her a series of love poems, published as "Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs" (1906), as well as authoring the religious satire "Why Jesus Wept" (1904).

In February 1904, Crowley and Rose arrived in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. Claiming to be a prince and princess, they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities, while studying <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a> and <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>. According to Crowley's later account, Rose regularly became delirious and informed him "they are waiting for you." On 18 March, she explained that "they" were the god <a href="Horus">Horus</a>, and on 20 March proclaimed that "the Equinox of the Gods has come". She led him to a nearby museum, where she showed him a seventh-century BCE mortuary <a href="stele">stele</a> known as the <a href="Stele%20of%20Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu">Stele of Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu</a>; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit's number was 666, the <a href="number%20of%20the%20beast">number of the beast</a> in Christian belief, and in later years termed the artefact the "Stele of Revealing."

According to Crowley's later statements, on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of <a href="Aiwass">Aiwass</a>, the messenger of Horus, or <a href="Heru-ra-ha">Hoor-Paar-Kraat</a>. Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days, and titled it "Liber L vel Legis" or "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Law">The pageRank.Book of the Law</a>". The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new <a href="Aeon%20%28Thelema%29">Aeon</a>, and that Crowley would serve as its <a href="prophet">prophet</a>. It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will. This book, and the philosophy that it espoused, became the cornerstone of Crowley's religion, <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a>. Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with "The pageRank.Book of the Law". Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.

Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic "Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden" to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the <a href="Society%20for%20Promoting%20Christian%20Knowledge">Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge</a>. Among its first publications were Crowley's "Collected Works", edited by <a href="Ivor%20Back">Ivor Back</a>. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was <a href="J.%20F.%20C.%20Fuller">J. F. C. Fuller</a>, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, "The Star in the West" (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.

Crowley decided to climb <a href="Kangchenjunga">Kangchenjunga</a> in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of <a href="Jules%20Jacot-Guillarmod">Jacot-Guillarmod</a>, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, <a href="1905%20Kanchenjunga%20expedition">the expedition</a> was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others, who thought that he was reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.

Spending time in <a href="Hariharpur%2C%20India">Moharbhanj</a>, where he took part in <a href="big%20game%20hunting">big game hunting</a> and wrote the homoerotic work "The Scented Garden", Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> before being forced to leave India after shooting dead a native man who tried to mug him. Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma, Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China, hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose. Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region's opium trade. Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey, which took the family from <a href="Tengyueh">Tengyueh</a> through to <a href="Yongchang">Yungchang</a>, <a href="Dali%2C%20Yunnan">Tali</a>, <a href="Yunnanfu">Yunnanfu</a>, and then <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>. On the way he spent much time on spiritual and magical work, reciting the "Bornless Ritual", an invocation to his <a href="Holy%20Guardian%20Angel">Holy Guardian Angel</a>, on a daily basis.

While Rose and Lilith returned to Europe, Crowley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend Elaine Simpson, who was fascinated by "The pageRank.Book of the Law"; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Aiwass. Crowley then sailed to Japan and Canada, before continuing to New York City, where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up Kangchenjunga. Upon arrival in Britain, Crowley learned that his daughter Lilith had died of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> in <a href="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>, something he later blamed on Rose's increasing alcoholism. Under emotional distress, his health began to suffer, and he underwent a series of surgical operations. He began short-lived romances with actress Vera "Lola" Neville (née Snepp) and author <a href="Ada%20Leverson">Ada Leverson</a>, while Rose gave birth to Crowley's second daughter, Lola Zaza, in February 1907.

With his old mentor George Cecil Jones, Crowley continued performing <a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Magic%20of%20Abramelin%20the%20Mage">the Abramelin rituals</a> at the Ashdown Park Hotel in <a href="Coulsdon">Coulsdon</a>, Surrey. Crowley claimed that in doing so he attained "<a href="samadhi">samadhi</a>", or union with Godhead, thereby marking a turning point in his life. Making heavy use of <a href="hashish">hashish</a> during these rituals, he wrote an essay on "The Psychology of Hashish" (1909) in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism. He also claimed to have been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907, adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him, "Liber VII" and "Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente", both of which were later classified in the corpus of <a href="Holy%20Books%20of%20Thelema">Holy Books of Thelema</a>. Crowley wrote down more Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year, including "Liber LXVI", "Liber Arcanorum", "Liber Porta Lucis, Sub Figura X", "Liber Tau", "Liber Trigrammaton" and "Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita", which he again claimed to have received from a preternatural source. Crowley stated that in June 1909, when the manuscript of "The pageRank.Book of the Law" was rediscovered at Boleskine, he developed the opinion that Thelema represented <a href="Objectivity%20%28philosophy%29">objective truth</a>.

Crowley's inheritance was running out. Trying to earn money, he was hired by George Montagu Bennett, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Tankerville">Earl of Tankerville</a>, to help protect him from <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. <a href="Victor%20Benjamin%20Neuburg">Victor Neuburg</a>, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a>, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochism</a>. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as "Ambergris", "Clouds Without Water", and "Konx Om Pax", as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, "The World's Tragedy". Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28British%20magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>", a magazine edited by his friend <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a>. He also wrote "<a href="777%20and%20Other%20Qabalistic%20Writings%20of%20Aleister%20Crowley">Liber 777</a>", a book of magical and <a href="Hermetic%20Qabalah">Qabalistic</a> <a href="Correspondence%20%28theology%29">correspondences</a> that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.

In November 1907, Crowley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, being aided in doing so by Fuller. The result was the <a href="A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴</a>. The group's headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London, and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn, but with an added Thelemic basis. Its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren, artist <a href="Austin%20Osman%20Spare">Austin Osman Spare</a>, Horace Sheridan-Bickers, author George Raffalovich, Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding, engineer Herbert Edward Inman, Kenneth Ward, and <a href="Charles%20Stansfeld%20Jones">Charles Stansfeld Jones</a>. In March 1909, Crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled "<a href="The%20Equinox">The Equinox</a>". He billed this periodical, which was to become the "Official Organ" of the A∴A∴, as "The Review of Scientific Illuminism".

Crowley had become increasingly frustrated with Rose's alcoholism, and in November 1909 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery. Lola was entrusted to Rose's care; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine. Her alcoholism worsened, and as a result she was institutionalised in September 1911.

In November 1909, Crowley and Neuburg travelled to Algeria, touring the desert from <a href="Jendouba">El Arba</a> to <a href="Sour%20El-Ghozlane">Aumale</a>, <a href="Bou%20Sa%C3%A2da">Bou Saâda</a>, and then <a href="D%C4%81%27leh%20Addin">Dā'leh Addin</a>, with Crowley reciting the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> on a daily basis. During the trip he invoked the thirty aethyrs of <a href="Enochian%20magic">Enochian magic</a>, with Neuburg recording the results, later published in "The Equinox" as "The Vision and the Voice". Following a mountaintop <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a> ritual, Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon <a href="Choronzon">Choronzon</a> involving <a href="blood%20sacrifice">blood sacrifice</a>, considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career. Returning to London in January 1910, Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in "The Equinox"; the court found in favour of Crowley. The case was widely reported in the press, with Crowley gaining wider fame. Crowley enjoyed this, and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice, despite being neither.

The publicity attracted new members to the A∴A∴, among them Frank Bennett, James Bayley, Herbert Close, and James Windram. The Australian violinist <a href="Leila%20Waddell">Leila Waddell</a> soon became Crowley's lover. Deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience, Crowley developed the Rites of Artemis, a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring A∴A∴ members personifying various deities. It was first performed at the A∴A∴ headquarters, with attendees given a fruit punch containing <a href="peyote">peyote</a> to enhance their experience. Various members of the press attended, and reported largely positively on it. In October and November 1910, Crowley decided to stage something similar, the <a href="Rites%20of%20Eleusis">Rites of Eleusis</a>, at <a href="Caxton%20Hall">Caxton Hall</a>, <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>; this time press reviews were mixed. Crowley came under particular criticism from West de Wend Fenton, editor of "<a href="The%20Looking%20Glass%20%28newspaper%29">The Looking Glass</a>" newspaper, who called him "one of the most blasphemous and cold-blooded villains of modern times". Fenton's articles suggested that Crowley and Jones were involved in homosexual activity; Crowley did not mind, but Jones unsuccessfully sued for libel. Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crowley over the scandal, and Crowley and Neuburg returned to Algeria for further magical workings.

"The Equinox" continued publishing, and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint, like Crowley's "Ambergris", "The Winged Beetle", and "The Scented Garden", as well as Neuburg's "The Triumph of Pan" and <a href="Ethel%20Archer">Ethel Archer</a>'s "The Whirlpool". In 1911, Crowley and Waddell holidayed in <a href="Montigny-sur-Loing">Montigny-sur-Loing</a>, where he wrote prolifically, producing poems, short stories, plays, and 19 works on magic and mysticism, including the two final Holy Books of Thelema. In Paris, he met <a href="Mary%20Desti">Mary Desti</a>, who became his next <a href="Babalon">"Scarlet Woman"</a>, with the two undertaking magical workings in <a href="St.%20Moritz">St. Moritz</a>; Crowley believed that one of the <a href="Secret%20Chiefs">Secret Chiefs</a>, Ab-ul-Diz, was speaking through her. Based on Desti's statements when in trance, Crowley wrote the two-volume "<a href="Magick%20%28Book%204%29">pageRank.Book 4</a>" (1912–13) and at the time developed the spelling "magick" in reference to the <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">paranormal phenomenon</a> as a means of distinguishing it from the <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">stage magic</a> of illusionists.

In early 1912, Crowley published "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Lies%20%28Crowley%29">The pageRank.Book of Lies</a>", a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as "his greatest success in merging his talents as poet, scholar, and magus". The German occultist <a href="Theodor%20Reuss">Theodor Reuss</a> later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order, the <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (O.T.O.), within "The pageRank.Book". Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental, and the two became friends. Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.O's British branch, the Mysteria Mystica Maxima (MMM), and at a ceremony in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> Crowley adopted the magical name of <a href="Baphomet">Baphomet</a> and was proclaimed "X° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona, and all the Britons". With Reuss' permission, Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re-writing many O.T.O. rituals, which were then based largely on <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group. Fascinated by the O.T.O's emphasis on <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a>, Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis%23Initiation%20and%20teachings">eleventh degree</a>.

In March 1913 Crowley acted as producer for "The Ragged Ragtime Girls", a group of female violinists led by Waddell, as they performed at London's <a href="Old%20Tivoli">Old Tivoli</a> theatre. They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks, where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler. In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including "<a href="Hymn%20to%20Pan">Hymn to Pan</a>", and the <a href="Gnostic%20Mass">Gnostic Mass</a>, a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city. In January 1914 Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding <a href="Jacob%20Epstein">Jacob Epstein</a>'s new monument to <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>. Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week "Paris Working", a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods <a href="Mercury%20%28mythology%29">Mercury</a> and <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a>. As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist <a href="Walter%20Duranty">Walter Duranty</a>. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote "Liber Agapé", a treatise on sex magic. Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley <a href="curse">curse</a>d him.

By 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A∴A∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons, and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps. During this time the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out.
After recuperating from a bout of <a href="phlebitis">phlebitis</a>, Crowley set sail for the United States aboard the "<a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS Lusitania</a>" in October 1914. Arriving in New York City, he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28US%20magazine%201913%E2%80%9336%29">Vanity Fair</a>" and undertaking freelance work for the famed astrologer <a href="Evangeline%20Adams">Evangeline Adams</a>. In the city, he continued experimenting with sex magic, through the use of masturbation, female prostitutes, and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries.
Professing to be of Irish ancestry and a supporter of <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish independence</a> from Great Britain, Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain. He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy <a href="George%20Sylvester%20Viereck">George Sylvester Viereck</a> employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, "<a href="The%20Fatherland">The Fatherland</a>", which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict. In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action. In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in "The Fatherland" were hyperbolic, for instance comparing <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt – reported on by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" – in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public. It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the "Lusitania", informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.

Crowley entered into a relationship with <a href="Jeanne%20Robert%20Foster">Jeanne Robert Foster</a>, with whom he toured the West Coast. In <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with <a href="Charles%20Stansfeld%20Jones">Charles Stansfeld Jones</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Talbot%20Smith">Wilfred Talbot Smith</a> to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with <a href="anhalonium">anhalonium</a> at <a href="Parke-Davis">Parke-Davis</a>, then visited Seattle, San Francisco, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%2C%20California">Santa Cruz</a>, Los Angeles, San Diego, <a href="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>, and the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>, before returning to New York. There he befriended <a href="Ananda%20Coomaraswamy">Ananda Coomaraswamy</a> and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried. Later that year he took a "magical retirement" to a cabin by <a href="Newfound%20Lake">Lake Pasquaney</a> owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself "Master Therion". He also wrote several short stories based on <a href="James%20George%20Frazer">J.G. Frazer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>" and a work of literary criticism, "The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw".

In December he moved to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, his favourite US city, before spending February 1917 with evangelical Christian relatives in <a href="Titusville%2C%20Florida">Titusville, Florida</a>. Returning to New York City, he moved in with artist and A∴A∴ member <a href="Leon%20Engers%20Kennedy">Leon Engers Kennedy</a> in May, learning of his mother's death. After the collapse of "The Fatherland", Crowley continued his association with Viereck, who appointed him contributing editor of arts journal "The International". Crowley used it to promote Thelema, but it soon ceased publication. He then moved to the studio apartment of Roddie Minor, who became his partner and Scarlet Woman. Through their rituals, which Crowley called "The Amalantrah Workings", he believed that they were contacted by a preternatural entity named Lam. The relationship soon ended.

In 1918, Crowley went on a magical retreat in the wilderness of <a href="Esopus%20Island">Esopus Island</a> on the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>. Here, he began a translation of the "<a href="Tao%20Te%20Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>", painted Thelemic slogans on the riverside cliffs, and – he later claimed – experienced <a href="reincarnation">past life memories</a> of being <a href="Ge%20Xuan">Ge Xuan</a>, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20VI">Pope Alexander VI</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Cagliostro">Alessandro Cagliostro</a>, and <a href="Eliphas%20Levi">Eliphas Levi</a>. Back in New York City, he moved to <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, where he took <a href="Leah%20Hirsig">Leah Hirsig</a> as his lover and next Scarlet Woman. He took up painting as a hobby, exhibiting his work at the Greenwich Village Liberal Club and attracting the attention of the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20World">New York Evening World</a>". With the financial assistance of sympathetic Freemasons, Crowley revived "The Equinox" with the first issue of volume III, known as "The Blue Equinox". He spent mid-1919 on a climbing holiday in <a href="Montauk%2C%20New%20York">Montauk</a> before returning to London in December.

Now destitute and back in London, Crowley came under attack from the tabloid "<a href="John%20Bull%20%28magazine%29">John Bull</a>", which labelled him traitorous "scum" for his work with the German war effort; several friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue, but he decided not to. When he was suffering from asthma, a doctor prescribed him heroin, to which he soon became addicted. In January 1920, he moved to Paris, renting a house in <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a> with <a href="Leah%20Hirsig">Leah Hirsig</a>; they were soon joined in a "ménage à trois" by Ninette Shumway, and also by Leah's newborn daughter Anne "Poupée" Leah. Crowley had ideas of forming a community of Thelemites, which he called the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Thelema">Abbey of Thelema</a> after the Abbaye de Thélème in <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais">François Rabelais</a>' satire "<a href="Gargantua%20and%20Pantagruel">Gargantua and Pantagruel</a>". After consulting the "<a href="I%20Ching">I Ching</a>", he chose <a href="Cefal%C3%B9">Cefalù</a> (on Sicily, Italy) as a location, and after arriving there, began renting the old Villa Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April.
Moving to the commune with Hirsig, Shumway, and their children Hansi, Howard, and Poupée, Crowley described the scenario as "perfectly happy ... my idea of heaven." They wore robes, and performed rituals to the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> at set times during the day, also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass; the rest of the day they were left to follow their own interests. Undertaking widespread correspondences, Crowley continued to paint, wrote a commentary on "The pageRank.Book of the Law", and revised the third part of "pageRank.Book 4". He offered a libertine education for the children, allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic. He occasionally travelled to <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> to visit <a href="rent%20boys">rent boys</a> and buy supplies, including drugs; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life, and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity. There was no cleaning rota, and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building, which soon became unsanitary. Poupée died in October 1920, and Ninette gave birth to a daughter, Astarte Lulu Panthea, soon afterwards.

New followers continued to arrive at the Abbey to be taught by Crowley. Among them was film star <a href="Jane%20Wolfe">Jane Wolfe</a>, who arrived in July 1920, where she was initiated into the A∴A∴ and became Crowley's secretary. Another was Cecil Frederick Russell, who often argued with Crowley, disliking the same-sex sexual magic that he was required to perform, and left after a year. More conducive was the Australian Thelemite Frank Bennett, who also spent several months at the Abbey. In February 1922, Crowley returned to Paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction. He then went to London in search of money, where he published articles in "<a href="The%20English%20Review">The English Review</a>" criticising the <a href="Dangerous%20Drugs%20Act%201920">Dangerous Drugs Act 1920</a> and wrote a novel, "<a href="Diary%20of%20a%20Drug%20Fiend">Diary of a Drug Fiend</a>", completed in July. On publication, it received mixed reviews; he was lambasted by the "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>", which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further reprints.

Subsequently, a young Thelemite named Raoul Loveday moved to the Abbey with his wife Betty May; while Loveday was devoted to Crowley, May detested him and life at the commune. She later said that Loveday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat, and that they were required to cut themselves with razors every time they used the pronoun "I". Loveday drank from a local polluted stream, soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in February 1923. Returning to London, May told her story to the press. "John Bull" proclaimed Crowley "the wickedest man in the world" and "a man we'd like to hang", and although Crowley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slanderous, he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them. As a result, "John Bull" continued its attack, with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout Europe and in North America. The <a href="Italian%20Fascism">Fascist</a> government of <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> learned of Crowley's activities and in April 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave Italy; without him, the Abbey closed.

Crowley and Hirsig went to <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, where, dogged by continuing poor health, he unsuccessfully tried again to give up heroin, and began writing what he termed his "<a href="hagiography">autohagiography</a>", "<a href="The%20Confessions%20of%20Aleister%20Crowley">The Confessions of Aleister Crowley</a>". They were joined in Tunis by the Thelemite <a href="Norman%20Mudd">Norman Mudd</a>, who became Crowley's public relations consultant. Employing a local boy, Mohammad ben Brahim, as his servant, Crowley went with him on a retreat to <a href="Nefta">Nefta</a>, where they performed sex magic together. In January 1924, Crowley travelled to <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, France, where he met with <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a>, underwent a series of nasal operations, and visited the <a href="Institute%20for%20the%20Harmonious%20Development%20of%20Man">Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man</a> and had a positive opinion of its founder, <a href="George%20Gurdjieff">George Gurdjieff</a>. Destitute, he took on a wealthy student, Alexander Zu Zolar, before taking on another American follower, Dorothy Olsen. Crowley took Olsen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in Nefta, where he also wrote "To Man" (1924), a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thelema to humanity. After spending the winter in Paris, in early 1925 Crowley and Olsen returned to Tunis, where he wrote "The Heart of the Master" (1938) as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance. In March Olsen became pregnant, and Hirsig was called to take care of her; she miscarried, following which Crowley took Olsen back to France. Hirsig later distanced herself from Crowley, who then denounced her.

According to Crowley, Reuss had named him head of the O.T.O. upon his death, but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.T.O., <a href="Heinrich%20Tr%C3%A4nker">Heinrich Tränker</a>. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like <a href="Karl%20Germer">Karl Germer</a> and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like <a href="Albin%20Grau">Albin Grau</a>, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman <a href="Israel%20Regardie">Israel Regardie</a>, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met <a href="Gerald%20Yorke">Gerald Yorke</a>, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended <a href="Thomas%20Driberg">Thomas Driberg</a>; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, "<a href="Magick%20in%20Theory%20and%20Practice">Magick in Theory and Practice</a>", which received little attention at the time.

In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was deported from France by the authorities, who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel "Moonchild" and book of short stories "The Stratagem". Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's "Confessions" could be published. Mandrake's owner <a href="P.R.%20Stephenson">P.R. Stephenson</a> meanwhile wrote "The Legend of Aleister Crowley", an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him.

In April 1930, Crowley moved to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, where he took Hanni Jaegar as his magical partner; the relationship was troubled. In September he went to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in Portugal to meet the poet <a href="Fernando%20Pessoa">Fernando Pessoa</a>. There, he decided to fake his own death, doing so with Pessoa's help at the <a href="Boca%20do%20Inferno">Boca do Inferno</a> rock formation. He then returned to Berlin, where he reappeared three weeks later at the opening of his art exhibition at the Gallery Neumann-Nierendorf. Crowley's paintings fitted with the fashion for <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a>; few of them sold, but the press reports were largely favourable. In August 1931, he took Bertha Busch as his new lover; they had a violent relationship, and often physically assaulted one another. He continued to have affairs with both men and women while in the city, and met with famous people like <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Adler">Alfred Adler</a>. After befriending him, in January 1932 he took the communist <a href="Gerald%20Hamilton">Gerald Hamilton</a> as a lodger, through whom he was introduced to many figures within the Berlin far left; it is possible that he was operating as a spy for British intelligence at this time, monitoring the communist movement.

Crowley left Busch and returned to London, where he took Pearl Brooksmith as his new Scarlet Woman. Undergoing further nasal surgery, it was here in 1932 that he was invited to be guest of honour at <a href="Foyles">Foyles</a>' Literary Luncheon, also being invited by <a href="Harry%20Price">Harry Price</a> to speak at the <a href="National%20Laboratory%20of%20Psychical%20Research">National Laboratory of Psychical Research</a>. In need of money, he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had libelled him, some of which proved successful. He gained much publicity for his lawsuit against <a href="Constable%20%26amp%3B%20Robinson">Constable and Co</a> for publishing <a href="Nina%20Hamnett">Nina Hamnett</a>'s "Laughing Torso" (1932) – a book he thought libelled him – but lost the case. The court case added to Crowley's financial problems, and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt. During the hearing, it was revealed that Crowley had been spending three times his income for several years.

Crowley developed a platonic friendship with Deidre Patricia O'Doherty; she offered to bear his child, who was born in May 1937. Named Randall Gair, Crowley nicknamed him Aleister Atatürk. Crowley continued to socialise with friends, holding curry parties in which he cooked particularly spicy food for them. In 1936, he published his first book in six years, "The Equinox of the Gods", which contained a facsimile of "The pageRank.Book of the Law" and was considered to be volume III, number 3, of "The Equinox" periodical. The work sold well, resulting in a second print run. In 1937 he gave a series of public lectures on yoga in Soho. Crowley was now living largely off contributions supplied by the O.T.O.'s <a href="Agape%20Lodge">Agape Lodge</a> in California, led by rocket scientist <a href="Jack%20Parsons%20%28rocket%20propulsion%20engineer%29">John Whiteside "Jack" Parsons</a>. Crowley was intrigued by the rise of Nazism in Germany, and influenced by his friend Martha Küntzel believed that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> might convert to Thelema; when the Nazis abolished the German O.T.O. and imprisoned Germer, who fled to the US, Crowley then lambasted Hitler as a <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>ian.

When the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> broke out, Crowley wrote to the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a> offering his services, but they declined. He associated with a variety of figures in Britain's intelligence community at the time, including <a href="Dennis%20Wheatley">Dennis Wheatley</a>, <a href="Roald%20Dahl">Roald Dahl</a>, <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>, and <a href="Maxwell%20Knight">Maxwell Knight</a>, and claimed to have been behind the "<a href="V%20sign">V for Victory</a>" sign first used by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>; this has never been proven.
In 1940, his asthma worsened, and with his German-produced medication unavailable, he returned to using heroin, once again becoming addicted. As <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> hit London, Crowley relocated to <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a>, where he was briefly hospitalised with asthma, and entertained himself with visits to the local chess club. Tiring of Torquay, he returned to London, where he was visited by American Thelemite <a href="Grady%20McMurtry">Grady McMurtry</a>, to whom Crowley awarded the title of "Hymenaeus Alpha". He stipulated that though Germer would be his immediate successor, McMurty should succeed Germer as head of the O.T.O. after the latter's death. With O.T.O. initiate <a href="Lady%20Frieda%20Harris">Lady Frieda Harris</a>, Crowley developed plans to produce a <a href="tarot%20card">tarot card</a> set, designed by him and painted by Harris. Accompanying this was a book, published in a limited edition as "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Thoth%20%28Crowley%29">The pageRank.Book of Thoth</a>" by <a href="Chiswick%20Press">Chiswick Press</a> in 1944. To aid the war effort, he wrote a proclamation on the rights of humanity, "Liber Oz", and a poem for the liberation of France, "Le Gauloise". Crowley's final publication during his lifetime was a book of poetry, "Olla: An Anthology of Sixty Years of Song". Another of his projects, "Aleister Explains Everything", was posthumously published as "<a href="Magick%20Without%20Tears">Magick Without Tears</a>".

In April 1944 Crowley briefly moved to <a href="Aston%20Clinton">Aston Clinton</a> in Buckinghamshire, where he was visited by the poet <a href="Nancy%20Cunard">Nancy Cunard</a>, before relocating to <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a> in Sussex, where he took up residence at the Netherwood boarding house. He took a young man named <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a> as his secretary, paying him in magical teaching rather than wages. He was also introduced to <a href="John%20Symonds">John Symonds</a>, whom he appointed to be his literary executor; Symonds thought little of Crowley, later publishing negative biographies of him. Corresponding with the illusionist <a href="Arnold%20Crowther">Arnold Crowther</a>, it was through him that Crowley was introduced to <a href="Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29">Gerald Gardner</a>, the future founder of <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a>. They became friends, with Crowley authorising Gardner to revive Britain's ailing O.T.O. Another visitor was <a href="Eliza%20Marian%20Butler">Eliza Marian Butler</a>, who interviewed Crowley for her book "The Myth of the Magus". Other friends and family also spent time with him, among them Doherty and Crowley's son Aleister Atatürk. On 1 December 1947, Crowley died at Netherwood of <a href="Chronic%20obstructive%20pulmonary%20disease">chronic bronchitis</a> aggravated by <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a> and myocardial degeneration, aged 72. His funeral was held at a <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> crematorium on 5 December; about a dozen people attended, and <a href="Louis%20Wilkinson">Louis Wilkinson</a> read excerpts from the <a href="Liber%20XV%2C%20The%20Gnostic%20Mass">Gnostic Mass</a>, "The pageRank.Book of the Law", and "Hymn to Pan". The funeral generated press controversy, and was labelled a <a href="Black%20Mass">Black Mass</a> by the tabloids. Crowley's ashes were sent to <a href="Karl%20Germer">Karl Germer</a> in the US, who buried them in his garden in <a href="Hampton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hampton, New Jersey</a>.

Crowley's belief system, Thelema, has been described by scholars as a religion, and more specifically as both a <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a>, and as a "magico-religious doctrine". It has also been characterised as a form of esotericism and <a href="modern%20Paganism">modern Paganism</a>. Although holding "The pageRank.Book of the Law"—which was composed in 1904—as its central text, Thelema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904.

In his autobiography, Crowley claimed that his purpose in life had been to "bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form", although what he meant by "<a href="paganism">paganism</a>" was unclear.
Crowley's thought was not always cohesive, and was influenced by a variety of sources, ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism, <a href="scientific%20naturalism">scientific naturalism</a>, and various currents within Western esotericism, among them ceremonial magic, alchemy, astrology, Rosicrucianism, Kabbalah, and the Tarot. He was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done. Crowley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and <a href="Tantra">Tantra</a> into his Thelemic system, believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems.
The historian Alex Owen noted that Crowley adhered to the "modus operandi" of the <a href="Decadent%20movement">Decadent movement</a> throughout his life.

Crowley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity's entry to the Aeon of Horus, a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny. He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship. He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus, and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon. Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe. Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be "the Great Work" or the attaining of the "knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel". His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire. The moral code of "Do What Thou Wilt" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not <a href="anarchism">anarchistic</a> or <a href="libertarianism">libertarian</a> in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.

Crowley believed in the objective existence of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, which he chose to spell "Magick", an older archaic spelling of the word. He provided various different definitions of this term over his career. In his book "Magick in Theory and Practice", Crowley defined Magick as "the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will". He also told his disciple Karl Germer that "Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours. Mysticism is the raising of oneself to their level." Crowley saw Magick as a third way between religion and science, giving "The Equinox" the subtitle of "The Method of Science; the Aim of Religion". Within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>, and urged magicians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments, "The more scientific the record is, the better". His understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a <a href="cultural%20evolution">cultural evolution</a>ary framework. Unlike Frazer however, Crowley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication, but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science.

Sexuality played an important role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>. This was often manifested as the <a href="Cake%20of%20Light">Cakes of Light</a>, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.

Crowley's theological beliefs were not clear. The historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> noted that some of Crowley's writings could be used to argue that he was an <a href="atheism">atheist</a>, while some support the idea that he was a <a href="polytheism">polytheist</a>, and others would bolster the idea that he was a <a href="mysticism">mystical</a> <a href="monotheism">monotheist</a>. On the basis of the teachings in "The pageRank.Book of the Law", Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he made the claim that all "true" deities were "derived" from this trinity.

Both during his life and after it, Crowley has been widely described as a <a href="Satanism">Satanist</a>, usually by detractors. Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist. He nevertheless utilised Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as "the Beast 666" and referring to the <a href="Whore%20of%20Babylon">Whore of Babylon</a> in his work, while in later life he sent "<a href="Christmas%20cards">Antichristmas cards</a>" to his friends. In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as "Our Lord God the Devil" at one occasion. The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley "was emphatically not" a Satanist, "if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such". Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity "as Socialists hate soap", an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren. He was also accused of advocating <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a>, largely because of a passage in "pageRank.Book 4" in which he stated that "A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to <a href="ejaculation">ejaculation</a>, something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own "ignorance and prejudice" toward Crowley.

Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time. The historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> stated that in Crowley's youth, he was "a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man" who "set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms", while being shielded from an "outraged public opinion" by his inherited wealth. Hutton also described Crowley as having both an "unappeasable desire" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and "a tendency to quarrel savagely" with those who challenged him. Crowley biographer <a href="Martin%20Booth">Martin Booth</a> asserted that Crowley was "self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel". Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was "capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty". Biographer <a href="Lawrence%20Sutin">Lawrence Sutin</a> noted that Crowley exhibited "courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will" while at the same time showing a "blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men". The Thelemite <a href="Lon%20Milo%20DuQuette">Lon Milo DuQuette</a> noted that Crowley "was by no means perfect" and "often alienated those who loved him dearest."

Crowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality, with <a href="John%20Symonds">John Symonds</a> noting that he "was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time". Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones. Pasi argued that it was difficult to classify Crowley as being either on the political <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left</a> or <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right</a> but he was perhaps best categorised as a "conservative revolutionary" despite not being affiliated with the German-based <a href="conservative%20revolutionary%20movement">conservative revolutionary movement</a>. Pasi noted that Crowley sympathised with extreme ideologies like <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> and <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>, in that they wished to violently overturn society and hoped that both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union might adopt Thelema. Crowley described democracy as an "imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness," and commented that "The pageRank.Book of the Law" proclaimed that "there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd". In this attitude he was influenced by the work of <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and by <a href="Social%20Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>. Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine, once describing his ideology as "aristocratic communism".

Crowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women, with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life. In particular he had an attraction toward "exotic women", and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that "when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived". Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma. During homosexual <a href="anal%20sex">anal intercourse</a>, he usually played the passive role, which Booth believed "appealed to his masochistic side". Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation, commenting that a person "must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise." On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.

Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that "blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings". Sutin thought Crowley "a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst <a href="John%20Bull">John Bull</a> racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries", noting that he "embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour". Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using <a href="Anti-Semitism">anti-Semitic</a> slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their "sublime" poetry and stated that they exhibited "imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit "avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest". He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a "spiritual superiority" to the English, and praised Muslims for exhibiting "manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect".

Crowley also exhibited a "general misogyny" that Booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother. Sutin noted that Crowley "largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility". Crowley described women as "moral inferiors" who had to be treated with "firmness, kindness and justice".

Crowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world. In 2002, a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy-third in a list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>. <a href="Richard%20Cavendish%20%28occult%20writer%29">Richard Cavendish</a> has written of him that "In native talent, penetrating intelligence and determination, Aleister Crowley was the best-equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century." The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as "one of the most well-known figures in modern occultism". The scholar of esotericism <a href="Wouter%20Hanegraaff">Wouter Hanegraaff</a> asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of "the dark side of the occult", adding that he was "the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century". The philosopher John Moore opined that Crowley stood out as a "Modern Master" when compared with other prominent occult figures like <a href="George%20Gurdjieff">George Gurdjieff</a>, <a href="P.D.%20Ouspensky">P.D. Ouspensky</a>, <a href="Rudolf%20Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a>, or <a href="Helena%20Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky</a>, also describing him as a "living embodiment" of <a href="Oswald%20Spengler">Oswald Spengler</a>'s "<a href="The%20Decline%20of%20the%20West">Faustian Man</a>".
Biographer <a href="Tobias%20Churton">Tobias Churton</a> considered Crowley "a pioneer of consciousness research". Hutton noted that Crowley had "an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions", while Sutin thought that he had made "distinctly original contributions" to the study of yoga in the West.

Thelema continued to develop and spread following Crowley's death. In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry; in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite <a href="Marcelo%20Ramos%20Motta">Marcelo Ramos Motta</a>.
Another American Thelemite was the filmmaker <a href="Kenneth%20Anger">Kenneth Anger</a>, who had been influenced by Crowley's writings from a young age. In the United Kingdom, <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a> propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the <a href="Typhonian%20Order">Typhonian Order</a>.
Also in Britain, an occultist known as <a href="Amado%20Crowley">Amado Crowley</a> claimed to be Crowley's son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado claimed to be propagating.

Several Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that "Crowley's influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous". Gerald Gardner, founder of <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a>, made use of much of Crowley's published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy, and the Australian witch <a href="Rosaleen%20Norton">Rosaleen Norton</a> was also heavily influenced by Crowley's ideas. More widely, Crowley became "a dominant figure" in the modern Pagan community. <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, the American founder of <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>, was involved in Thelema in the early 1940s (with <a href="Jack%20Parsons%20%28rocket%20engineer%29">Jack Parsons</a>), and it has been argued that <a href="Scientology%20and%20the%20occult">Crowley's ideas influenced some of Hubbard's work</a>. The scholars of religion Asbjørn Dyrendel, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist, he "in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy", with his "image and ought" becoming an "important influence" on the later development of religious Satanism. For instance, two prominent figures in religious Satanism, <a href="Anton%20LaVey">Anton LaVey</a> and <a href="Temple%20of%20Set">Michael Aquino</a>, were influenced by Crowley's work.

Crowley also had a wider influence in <a href="British%20popular%20culture">British popular culture</a>. He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' album "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>" (1967), and his motto of "Do What Thou Wilt" was inscribed on the vinyl of <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s album "<a href="Led%20Zeppelin%20III">Led Zeppelin III</a>" (1970). Led Zeppelin co-founder <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a> bought Boleskine in 1971, and part of the band's film "<a href="The%20Song%20Remains%20the%20Same%20%28film%29">The Song Remains the Same</a>" was filmed in the grounds. He sold it in 1992. <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> made reference to Crowley in the lyrics of his song "<a href="Quicksand%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Quicksand</a>" (1971), while <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> and his lyricist <a href="Bob%20Daisley">Bob Daisley</a> wrote a song titled "<a href="Mr%20Crowley">Mr Crowley</a>" (1980). Crowley began to receive scholarly attention from academics in the late 1990s.

Afterlife

The afterlife (also referred to as life after death or the hereafter) is the belief that an <a href="essence">essential part</a> of an individual's <a href="Personal%20identity">identity</a> or the <a href="Stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28psychology%29">stream of consciousness</a> continues to manifest after the <a href="death">death</a> of the physical body. According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire <a href="soul">soul</a> or <a href="spirit">spirit</a>, of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian <a href="nirvana">nirvana</a>. Belief in an afterlife, which may be <a href="Naturalism%20%28philosophy%29">natural</a>istic or <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a>, is in contrast to the belief in <a href="eternal%20oblivion">oblivion after death</a>.

In some popular views, this continued existence often takes place in a <a href="Spirituality">spiritual</a> realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be <a href="%23Reincarnation">reborn</a> into <a href="World%20%28theology%29">this world</a> and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or <a href="Otherworld">Otherworld</a>. Major views on the afterlife derive from <a href="religion">religion</a>, <a href="esotericism">esotericism</a> and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>.

Some belief systems, such as those in the <a href="Abrahamic%20religion">Abrahamic tradition</a>, hold that the dead go to a specific <a href="Plane%20%28esotericism%29">plane of existence</a> after death, as determined by <a href="God">God</a>, or other <a href="divine%20judgment">divine judgment</a>, based on their <a href="orthopraxy">actions</a> or <a href="orthodoxy">beliefs</a> during life. In contrast, in systems of <a href="%23Reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, such as those in the <a href="Indian%20religions">Indian religions</a>, the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of another being.
<a href="Theists">Theists</a> generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The <a href="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.

Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.

Reincarnation is the <a href="Philosophy">philosophical</a> or <a href="Religion">religious</a> concept that an aspect of a living <a href="being">being</a> starts a new <a href="life">life</a> in a different <a href="physical%20body">physical body</a> or form after each biological <a href="death">death</a>. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the <a href="Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra">Saṃsāra</a> doctrine of cyclic existence. It is a central tenet of all major <a href="Indian%20religions">Indian religions</a>, namely <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, and <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>. The idea of reincarnation is found in many ancient cultures, and a belief in rebirth/<a href="metempsychosis">metempsychosis</a> was held by Greek historic figures, such as <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as <a href="Spiritism">Spiritism</a>, <a href="Theosophy">Theosophy</a>, and <a href="Eckankar">Eckankar</a> and is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>.

Although the majority of denominations within the <a href="Abrahamic%20religions">Abrahamic religions</a> of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and <a href="Islam">Islam</a> do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, the <a href="Catharism">Cathars</a>, <a href="Alawites">Alawites</a>, the <a href="Druze">Druze</a>, and the <a href="Rosicrucians">Rosicrucians</a>. The historical relations between these sects and the beliefs about reincarnation that were characteristic of <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>, <a href="Orphism%20%28religion%29">Orphism</a>, <a href="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="Manicheanism">Manicheanism</a>, and <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> of the <a href="Roman%20era">Roman era</a> as well as the Indian religions have been the subject of recent scholarly research. <a href="Unity%20Church">Unity Church</a> and its founder <a href="Charles%20Fillmore%20%28Unity%20Church%29">Charles Fillmore</a> teach reincarnation.

Rosicrucians speak of a <a href="life%20review">life review</a> period occurring immediately after death and before entering the afterlife's <a href="Plane%20%28esotericism%29">planes of existence</a> (before the <a href="silver%20cord">silver cord</a> is broken), followed by a <a href="Last%20Judgment%23Esoteric%20Christian%20tradition">judgment</a>, more akin to a final review or end report over one's life.

Heaven, the heavens, <a href="Seven%20Heavens">seven heavens</a>, <a href="pure%20land">pure land</a>s, <a href="Tian">Tian</a>, <a href="Jannah">Jannah</a>, <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, or <a href="the%20Summerland">the Summerland</a>, is a common <a href="Religious%20cosmology">religious, cosmological</a>, or <a href="transcendence%20%28philosophy%29">transcendent</a> place where beings such as <a href="Deity">gods</a>, <a href="angel">angel</a>s, <a href="jinn">jinn</a>, <a href="saint">saint</a>s, or <a href="Veneration%20of%20the%20dead">venerated ancestors</a> are said to originate, be <a href="throne">enthroned</a>, or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or <a href="Incarnation">incarnate</a>, and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases <a href="Entering%20Heaven%20alive">enter Heaven alive</a>.

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the <a href="Sacred">holiest</a> place, a <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a>, in contrast to <a href="Hell">Hell</a> or the <a href="Underworld">Underworld</a> or the "low places", and <a href="Universal%20reconciliation">universally</a> or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of <a href="divinity">divinity</a>, <a href="good%20and%20evil">goodness</a>, <a href="piety">piety</a>, <a href="faith">faith</a> or other <a href="virtue">virtue</a>s or <a href="orthodoxy">right beliefs</a> or simply the <a href="will%20of%20God">will of God</a>. Some believe in the possibility of a Heaven on Earth in a <a href="World%20to%20Come">World to Come</a>.

In <a href="Indian%20religions">Indian religions</a>, Heaven is considered as "<a href="Svarga">Svarga loka</a>", and the soul is again subjected to <a href="Reincarnation">rebirth</a> in different living forms according to its "<a href="karma">karma</a>". This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves "<a href="Moksha">Moksha</a>" or "<a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a>". Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) is referred to as "<a href="otherworld">otherworld</a>."

Hell, in many religious and folkloric traditions, is a place or state of <a href="torture">torment</a> and <a href="punishment">punishment</a> in an afterlife. <a href="Religion">Religion</a>s with a <a href="Philosophy%20of%20history%23Cyclical%20and%20linear%20history">linear</a> <a href="Divinity">divine</a> history often depict hells as eternal destinations while Religions with a <a href="reincarnation">cyclic history</a> often depict a hell as an intermediary period between <a href="incarnation">incarnation</a>s. Typically these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>, <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a>, <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a>, and <a href="Limbo">Limbo</a>.

Other traditions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe hell as an abode of the dead, the <a href="grave">grave</a>, a neutral place located under the surface of Earth (for example, see <a href="sheol">sheol</a> and <a href="Christian%20views%20on%20Hades">Hades</a>).

The afterlife played an important role in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Ancient Egyptian religion</a>, and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as "ka" (body double) and the "ba" (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the <a href="Aaru">Fields of Aaru</a>, <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.

Arriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20the%20Dead">pageRank.Book of the Dead</a>. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the "Shu" feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess <a href="Ma%27at">Ma'at</a>. If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon <a href="Ammit">Ammit</a>.

Egyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian "coffin" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly <a href="Embalming">embalmed</a> and entombed in a <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a>, could the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20Dead">dead live again</a> in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the pageRank.Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the "opening of the mouth".

Ancient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through <a href="mummification">mummification</a>, and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the "ka", the "ba", and the "akh". The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.

On March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by <a href="User%20%28Ancient%20Egyptian%20official%29">User</a>, a powerful adviser to the <a href="18th%20dynasty">18th dynasty</a> Queen <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a>.

The Greek god <a href="Hades">Hades</a> is known in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> as the king of the <a href="underworld">underworld</a>, a place where souls live after death. The Greek god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River <a href="Styx">Styx</a>, the river between life and death.

<a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Charon</a>, also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by <a href="Aeacus">Aeacus</a>, <a href="Rhadamanthus">Rhadamanthus</a> and King <a href="Minos">Minos</a>. The soul would be sent to <a href="Elysium">Elysium</a>, <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, <a href="Asphodel%20Fields">Asphodel Fields</a>, or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.

The Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>. In the ancient Greek myth about the <a href="Labours%20of%20Heracles">Labours of Heracles</a>, the hero <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> had to travel to the underworld to capture <a href="Cerberus">Cerberus</a>, the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.

In "<a href="Dream%20of%20Scipio">Dream of Scipio</a>", <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> describes what seems to be an <a href="out%20of%20body%20experience">out of body experience</a>, of the <a href="soul">soul</a> traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.

In pageRank.Book VI of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", the hero, <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>, and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, <a href="Lethe">Lethe</a>, which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.

The <a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic</a> and <a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:

<a href="She%27ol">She'ol</a>, in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.

The inhabitants of Sheol are the "shades" ("<a href="rephaim">rephaim</a>"), entities without personality or strength. Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the <a href="Witch%20of%20Endor">Witch of Endor</a> contacts the shade of <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a> for <a href="Saul">Saul</a>, but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).

While the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the <a href="Second%20Temple%20period">Second Temple period</a> (roughly 500 BC–70 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone. When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into <a href="Septuagint">Greek</a> in ancient <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> around 200 BC, the word "<a href="Hades">Hades</a>" (the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Greek underworld</a>) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the <a href="evil">evil</a> it represents.
The <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the "Olam Haba" or <a href="world%20to%20come">world to come</a>. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a "re-schooling", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of "eternal <a href="damnation">damnation</a>", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.

<a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> describes the "Olam Haba" in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the <a href="Messianic%20era">Messianic era</a>. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was "housed" during its earthly existence.

The <a href="Zohar">Zohar</a> describes <a href="Gehenna">Gehenna</a> not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.

Although there is no reference to reincarnation in the Talmud or any prior writings, according to rabbis such as Avraham Arieh Trugman, reincarnation is recognized as being part and parcel of Jewish tradition. Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism, the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.

<a href="Shraga%20Simmons">Shraga Simmons</a> commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.

Yirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an "ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. <a href="Onkelos">Onkelos</a>, a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, "Let Reuben live and not die ..." (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, <a href="Nachmanides">Nachmanides</a> (Ramban 1195–1270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying "God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to ... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30)."

Reincarnation, called "<a href="gilgul">gilgul</a>", became popular in <a href="folk%20belief">folk belief</a>, and is found in much <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> literature among <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. <a href="Martin%20Buber">Martin Buber</a>'s early collection of stories of the <a href="Baal%20Shem%20Tov">Baal Shem Tov</a>'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.

Among well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are <a href="Saadia%20Gaon">Saadia Gaon</a>, <a href="David%20Kimhi">David Kimhi</a>, <a href="Hasdai%20Crescas">Hasdai Crescas</a>, Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), <a href="Joseph%20Albo">Joseph Albo</a>, <a href="Abraham%20ibn%20Daud">Abraham ibn Daud</a>, the <a href="Asher%20ben%20Jehiel">Rosh</a> and <a href="Leon%20de%20Modena">Leon de Modena</a>. Saadia Gaon, in <a href="Emunoth%20ve-Deoth">Emunoth ve-Deoth</a> (Hebrew: "beliefs and opinions") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of <a href="metempsychosis">metempsychosis</a> (reincarnation). While refuting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.

Other well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, <a href="Abraham%20Isaac%20Kook">Abraham Isaac Kook</a>, Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter, and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.

Among the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His "<a href="Shaar%20HaGilgulim">Shaar HaGilgulim</a>", "The Gates of Reincarnation", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.

Rabbi Naftali Silberberg of The <a href="Rohr%20Jewish%20Learning%20Institute">Rohr Jewish Learning Institute</a> notes that "Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews."

<a href="Mainstream%20Christianity">Mainstream Christianity</a> professes belief in the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>, and <a href="English%20versions%20of%20the%20Nicene%20Creed%20in%20current%20use">English versions of the Nicene Creed in current use</a> include the phrase: "We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come." Although punishments are made part of certain Christian conceptions of the afterlife, the prevalent concept of "eternal damnation" is a tenet of the Christian afterlife.

When questioned by the <a href="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> about the <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a> (in a context relating to who one's spouse would be if one had been married several times in life), <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> said that marriage will be irrelevant after the resurrection as the resurrected will be like the <a href="angels">angels</a> in heaven.

Jesus also maintained that the time would come when the dead would hear the voice of the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a>, and all who were in the tombs would come out, who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation.

The <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Enoch">pageRank.Book of Enoch</a> describes Sheol as divided into four compartments for four types of the dead: the faithful saints who await resurrection in <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a>, the merely virtuous who await their reward, the wicked who await punishment, and the wicked who have already been punished and will not be resurrected on Judgment Day. It should be noted that the pageRank.Book of Enoch is considered apocryphal by most denominations of Christianity and all denominations of Judaism.

The book of <a href="2%20Maccabees">2 Maccabees</a> gives a clear account of the dead awaiting a future resurrection and judgment, plus prayers and offerings for the dead to remove the burden of sin.
The author of <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Luke</a> recounts the story of <a href="Lazarus%20and%20Dives">Lazarus and the rich man</a>, which shows people in Hades awaiting the resurrection either in comfort or torment. The author of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a> writes about God and the angels versus <a href="Satan">Satan</a> and <a href="demons">demons</a> in an epic battle at the end of times when all souls are judged. There is mention of ghostly bodies of past prophets, and the <a href="transfiguration%20of%20Jesus">transfiguration</a>.

The non-canonical <a href="Acts%20of%20Paul%20and%20Thecla">Acts of Paul and Thecla</a> speak of the efficacy of <a href="prayer%20for%20the%20dead">prayer for the dead</a>, so that they might be "translated to a state of happiness".

<a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a> pictures the <a href="underworld">underworld</a> (<a href="Hades">Hades</a>) as a place where the righteous dead, awaiting in the <a href="bosom%20of%20Abraham">bosom of Abraham</a> their resurrection, rejoice at their future prospect, while the unrighteous are tormented at the sight of the "<a href="Lake%20of%20fire">lake of unquenchable fire</a>" into which they are destined to be cast.

Gregory of Nyssa discusses the long-before believed possibility of purification of souls after death.

Pope Gregory I repeats the concept, articulated over a century earlier by <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nyssa">Gregory of Nyssa</a> that the saved suffer purification after death, in connection with which he wrote of "purgatorial flames".

The noun <a href="Purgatory">"purgatorium"</a> (Latin: place of cleansing) is used for the first time to describe a state of painful purification of the saved after life. The same word in adjectival form ("purgatorius -a -um", cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing, was already used by Christians such as Augustine of Hippo and <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a> to refer to an after-death cleansing.

During the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, theologians and philosophers presented various philosophies and beliefs. A notable example is <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a> who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is "<a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28Swedenborg%29">Heaven and Hell</a>". His report of life there covers a wide range of topics, such as <a href="marriage">marriage</a> in heaven (where all <a href="angels">angels</a> are married), children in heaven (where they are raised by angel parents), <a href="time">time</a> and <a href="space">space</a> in heaven (there are none), the after-death awakening process in the World of Spirits (a place halfway between Heaven and Hell and where people first wake up after death), the allowance of a free will choice between Heaven or Hell (as opposed to being sent to either one by God), the <a href="eternity">eternity</a> of <a href="Hell">Hell</a> (one could leave but would never want to), and that all angels or devils were once people on earth.

On the other hand, the enlightenment produced more rationalist philosophies such as <a href="deism">deism</a>. Many deist freethinkers held that belief in an afterlife with reward and punishment was a necessity of reason and good morals.

Some Christians deny that entry into Heaven can be properly earned, rather it is a gift that is solely God's to give through his unmerited grace. They underlie this belief to a passage from <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">St. Paul</a>: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that no one can boast." Since the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, <a href="Martin%20Luther">Lutheran</a> and <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> theological traditions emphasize the necessity of God's undeserved grace for salvation, and reject so-called <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagianism</a>, which would make man earn salvation through <a href="good%20works">good works</a>. Other Christians do not accept this doctrine, leading to many controversies on <a href="Grace%20%28Christianity%29">grace</a> and <a href="free%20will">free will</a>, and the idea of <a href="predestination">predestination</a>. In particular, the belief that heaven is a reward for good behavior is a common folk belief in Christian societies, even among members of churches which reject that belief.

Some Christian believers have come to downplay the punishment of hell. <a href="Universalists">Universalists</a> teach that salvation is for all. <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> and <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a> teach that sinners are destroyed rather than tortured forever. John 3:16 says that only those that accept Jesus will be given <a href="Eternal%20life%20%28Christianity%29">eternal life</a>, so the people that do not accept him cannot burn in hell for eternity because Jesus has not given them eternal life, instead it says they will perish.

In American pop culture depictions of Heaven, particularly in vintage cartoons such as those by <a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> in the mid-20th century, the <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">souls</a> of virtuous people ascend to Heaven and are converted into <a href="angels">angels</a>. However, this is not in accordance with the orthodox Christian theology. Christianity depicts a sharp distinction between "angels", divine beings created by God before the creation of humanity and are used as messengers, and "saints", the souls of humans who have received immortality from the grace of God through faith in Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who dwell in Heaven <a href="Beatific%20Vision">with God</a>.

Latter Day Saints believe that the soul existed before earth life and will exist in the hereafter. Angels are either spirits that have not yet come to earth to experience their mortality, or spirits or resurrected beings that have already passed through mortality and do the will of God. See Job 38:4-7, D&C 93:29. According to LDS Doctrine, Michael the Archangel became the first man on earth, Adam, to experience his mortality. The Angel of Moroni visited the boy, Joseph Smith, after living out his mortal life in ancient America. Later, he received Angelic administrations from the Apostles Peter, James, and John, John the Baptist, and others.

The Catholic conception of the afterlife teaches that <a href="Particular%20judgment">after the body dies, the soul is judged</a>, the righteous and free of sin enter Heaven. However, those who die in unrepented <a href="mortal%20sin">mortal sin</a> go to hell. In the 1990s, the <a href="Catechism%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a> defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry <a href="venial%20sin">venial sin</a> go to a place called <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a> where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.

Despite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a <a href="dogma">dogma</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, <a href="Virtue%23Christianity">virtuous</a> individuals who lived before <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Jesus Christ was born on earth</a>, or those that die before <a href="baptism">baptism</a> exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the <a href="beatific%20vision">beatific vision</a>, nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal <a href="sin">sin</a> although they have not received baptism, so still bear <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.

In other <a href="Christian%20denominations">Christian denominations</a> it has been described as an <a href="intermediate%20state">intermediate place</a> or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.

The notion of <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a> is associated particularly with the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a "cleansing fire" although it is not always called purgatory.

<a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>s of the <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> tradition generally also hold to the belief. <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, the founder of <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>, believed in an <a href="intermediate%20state">intermediate state</a> between death and the <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a> and in the possibility of "continuing to grow in holiness there", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of <a href="Prayer%20for%20the%20dead">helping by prayer</a> any who may be in that state.

The Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred. Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a> (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner. Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that "the 'location' of one’s final destiny—heaven or hell—as being figurative." Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. "The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience." For instance, <a href="St.%20Isaac%20the%20Syrian">St. Isaac the Syrian</a> observes that "those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability." In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God. Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: "19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God." As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. <a href="Thomas%20Hopko">Thomas Hopko</a> writes, "[I]t is precisely the presence of God’s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be "all and in all," with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God’s gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain."

Moreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of "<a href="apokatastasis">apokatastasis</a>", or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nyssa">Gregory of Nyssa</a>. The <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Second Council of Constantinople</a> (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach. It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as <a href="Olivier%20Cl%C3%A9ment">Olivier Clément</a>, Metropolitan <a href="Kallistos%20Ware">Kallistos Ware</a>, and Bishop <a href="Hilarion%20Alfeyev">Hilarion Alfeyev</a>. Although apokatastasis is not a dogma of the church but instead a <a href="wikt%3Atheologoumenon%23English">theologoumena</a>, it is no less a teaching of the Orthodox Church than its rejection. As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, "It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved," as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.

<a href="Joseph%20F.%20Smith">Joseph F. Smith</a> of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness—a spirit prison or "hell" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison <a href="https%3A//www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20%3Flang%3Deng">(1 Peter 3:18-20)</a> and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the <a href="Harrowing%20of%20Hell">Harrowing of Hell</a> doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths. Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned "permanently" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived– Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.

The Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to True to the Faith, (A handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith) "The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have "received the testimony of Jesus" and been "made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood" (D&C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins."

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> occasionally use terms such as "afterlife" to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul. Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the <a href="Great%20Flood">Great Flood</a> or at <a href="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>, are given no hope of an afterlife. However, they believe that after Armageddon there will be a bodily resurrection of "both righteous and unrighteous" dead (but not the "wicked"). Survivors of Armageddon and those who are resurrected are then to gradually restore earth to a paradise. After Armageddon, unrepentant sinners are punished with eternal death (non-existence).

The Seventh-day Adventist Church, teaches that the first death, or death brought about by living on a planet with sinful conditions (sickness, old age, accident, etc.) is a sleep of the soul. Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten" (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is <a href="immortality">immortal</a>. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are "asleep". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever.(Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11-14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:13-17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1-10; Rev. 20; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; Jer. 4:23-26; Rev. 21:1-5; Mal. 4:1; Eze. 28:18, 19; 2 Peter 3:13; Isa. 35; 65:17-25; Matt. 5:5; Rev. 21:1-7; 22:1-5; 11:15.)

The Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> is descriptive. The <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> word for Paradise is "<a href="Jannah">Jannah</a>" and Hell is "<a href="Jahannam">Jahannam</a>". Their level of comfort while in the grave depends wholly on their level of "<a href="Iman%20%28concept%29">Iman</a>" or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being <a href="God">God</a> or <a href="Allah">Allah</a>. In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy Iman one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of Iman chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice <a href="Islam">Islam</a> long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire "<a href="Tasbih">Tasbih</a>" and recite the names of Allah in such manner as "SubahannAllah" or <a href="Glory%20%28religion%29">Glory</a> be to Allah over and over again to acquire good deeds.

Islam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship the Creator of the Heavens and Earth (Allah) alone that includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode be it punishment or "Jannat" in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.

"Jannah" and "Jahannam" both have different levels. "Jannah" has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. "Jahannam" possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during <a href="Judgment%20Day">Judgment Day</a>, which commences after the Angel <a href="Israfil">Israfil</a> blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.

In the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.

A central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.

Until the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.

The resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: "Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them"?).

On the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.

<a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadi</a> Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to <a href="Mirza%20Ghulam%20Ahmad">Mirza Ghulam Ahmad</a>, the founder of <a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya</a> sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own's rights over that of other's becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and Peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.

The Sufi scholar <a href="Ibn%20%27Arabi">Ibn 'Arabi</a> defined <a href="Barzakh%23Sufism">Barzakh</a> as the intermediate realm or "isthmus". It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds. Without it, there would be no contact between the two and both would cease to exist. He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can. In broader terms Barzakh, "is anything that separates two things". It has been called the dream world in which the dreamer is in both life and death.

The teachings of the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a> state that the nature of the afterlife is beyond the understanding of those living, just as an unborn fetus cannot understand the nature of the world outside of the <a href="womb">womb</a>. The <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20literature">Bahá'í writings</a> state that the soul is immortal and after death it will continue to progress until it attains <a href="God%20in%20the%20Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">God's presence</a>. In Bahá'í belief, souls in the afterlife will continue to retain their individuality and consciousness and will be able to recognize and communicate spiritually with other souls whom they have made deep profound friendships with, such as their <a href="Marriage">spouses</a>.

The Bahá'í scriptures also state there are distinctions between souls in the afterlife, and that souls will recognize the worth of their own deeds and understand the consequences of their actions. It is explained that those souls that have turned toward God will experience gladness, while those who have lived in error will become aware of the opportunities they have lost. Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.

The <a href="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> describe reincarnation ("punarjanma") (see also: <a href="samsara">samsara</a>). The <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>, an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, the Lord <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called "Mukti" (Sanskrit: मुक्ति) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is "<a href="Moksha">Moksha</a>" (Sanskrit: मोक्ष) or salvation.

The <a href="Garuda%20Purana">Garuda Purana</a> deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death <a href="Yama">Yama</a> sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings & deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.

According to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.

The soul, called "<a href="Atman%20%28Hinduism%29">Atman</a>" leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or Karma performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad Karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad Karmas in "<a href="Naraka%20%28Hinduism%29">naraka</a>" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in "svarga" or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as "Mrutyulok" or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only & only yajna karma (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as "Moksha" or "Nirvana", which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. Atma moves with "Parmatma" or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an "Atma" or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements—Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of "Narkas" or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad Karmas and dealt with accordingly.

Hindus also believe in "<a href="Karma">Karma</a>". 'Karma' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. Satkarma means good deeds, vikarma means bad deeds. According to <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> the basic concept of Karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good 'Karma' brings good rewards and bad 'karmas' lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when Arjuna hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus "Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a "kshatriya" (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles."

Buddhists maintain that <a href="rebirth%20%28Buddhism%29">rebirth</a> takes place without an unchanging <a href="Atman%20%28Buddhism%29">self</a> or soul passing from one form to another. The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions (kamma or <a href="karma">karma</a>). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a <a href="ghost">ghost</a> or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness (<a href="metta">metta</a>), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.

Yet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to Theravada Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.

Pure Land Buddhism of Mahayana believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called Pure Land. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.

In <a href="Tibetan%20Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a> the <a href="Bardo%20Thodol">Tibetan pageRank.Book of the Dead</a> explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different <a href="Buddhahood">Buddha</a>s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the <a href="Dharma%20%28Buddhism%29">Dharma</a> and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.

"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition."

<a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a> has a very strong belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in "<a href="Guru%20Granth%20Sahib">Guru Granth Sahib</a>", but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.

But if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in "Guru Granth Sahib" and in "<a href="Dasam%20granth">Dasam granth</a>", so from that it can been concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.

<a href="Traditional%20African%20religion">Traditional African religion</a>s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife. <a href="Hunter-gatherer">Hunter-gatherer</a> societies such as the <a href="Hadza%20people">Hadza</a> have no particular belief in an afterlife, and the death of an individual is a straightforward end to their existence. <a href="Veneration%20of%20the%20dead">Ancestor cults</a> are found throughout <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, including cultures like the <a href="Yombe%20people">Yombe</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Mand%C3%A9%20peoples%20of%20Africa">Beng</a>, <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba</a> and <a href="Ewe%20people">Ewe</a>, "[T]he belief that the dead come back into life and are reborn into their families is given concrete expression in the personal names that are given to children...What is reincarnated are some of the dominant characteristics of the ancestor and not his soul. For each soul remains distinct and each birth represents a new soul." The Yoruba, <a href="Dogon%20people">Dogon</a> and LoDagoa have eschatological ideas similar to Abrahamic religions, "but in most African societies, there is a marked absence of such clear-cut notions of heaven and hell, although there are notions of God judging the soul after death." In some societies like the <a href="Mende%20people">Mende</a>, multiple beliefs coexist. The Mende believe that people die twice: once during the process of joining the <a href="Mende%20people%23Secret%20societies">secret society</a>, and again during biological death after which they become ancestors. However, some Mende also believe that after people are created by God they live ten consecutive lives, each in progressively descending worlds. One cross-cultural theme is that the ancestors are part of the world of the living, interacting with it regularly.

It is common for families to participate in ceremonies for children at a shrine, yet have a <a href="Japanese%20funeral">Buddhist funeral</a> at the time of death. In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called "<a href="yomi">yomi</a>" (黄泉), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This "yomi" very closely resembles the Greek <a href="Greek%20underworld">Hades</a>; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even <a href="Elysium">Elysium</a>-like descriptions such as in the legend of <a href="Okuninushi">Okuninushi</a> and <a href="Susanoo">Susanoo</a>. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called "kegare". However, death is also viewed as a path towards <a href="apotheosis">apotheosis</a> in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor <a href="Ojin">Ojin</a> who was enshrined as <a href="Hachiman">Hachiman</a> the God of War after his death.

Some <a href="Unitarian%20Universalist">Unitarian Universalist</a>s believe in <a href="universalism">universalism</a>: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell. Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue. Although Unitarians historically believed in a literal hell, and Universalists historically believed that everyone goes to heaven, modern Unitarian Universalists can be categorized into those believing in a heaven, reincarnation and oblivion. Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.

According to <a href="Edgar%20Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a>, the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.

Mainstream <a href="Spiritualist">Spiritualist</a>s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of "soulfulness" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.

The Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as <a href="The%20Summerland">The Summerland</a>. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.

Zoroastrianism states that the "urvan", the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the <a href="Gathas">Ustavaiti Gathas</a> with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the <a href="Yasna">Yasna</a>. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon <a href="Vizaresa">Vizaresa</a> (Vīzarəša), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness (<a href="hell">hell</a>).

<a href="Jamshid">Yima</a> is believed to have been the first <a href="king">king</a> on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the <a href="spirits">spirits</a> live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.

Rituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses <a href="Chinvat%20bridge">Chinvat bridge</a> which is the <a href="Final%20Judgment">Final Judgment</a> of the soul. Rashnu and <a href="Sraosha">Sraosha</a> are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include <a href="Bahman">Vahman</a> and <a href="Ahura%20Mazda">Ormazd</a>. <a href="Rashnu">Rashnu</a> is the <a href="yazata">yazata</a> who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.

<a href="Misvan%20Gatu">Misvan Gatu</a> is the 'place of the mixed ones' where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.

The <a href="Society%20for%20Psychical%20Research">Society for Psychical Research</a> was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like <a href="William%20Crookes">William Crookes</a>, and philosophers such as <a href="Henry%20Sidgwick">Henry Sidgwick</a> and <a href="William%20James">William James</a>.

Parapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of <a href="haunting">haunting</a>, <a href="apparitional%20experience">apparitions</a> of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, <a href="electronic%20voice%20phenomenon">electronic voice phenomena</a>, and <a href="mediumship">mediumship</a>. But also the study of the near death experience. Scientists who have worked in this area include <a href="Raymond%20Moody">Raymond Moody</a>, <a href="Susan%20Blackmore">Susan Blackmore</a>, <a href="Charles%20Tart">Charles Tart</a>, <a href="William%20James">William James</a>, <a href="Ian%20Stevenson">Ian Stevenson</a>, <a href="Michael%20Persinger">Michael Persinger</a>, <a href="Pim%20van%20Lommel">Pim van Lommel</a> and <a href="Penny%20Sartori">Penny Sartori</a> among others.

A <a href="21%20grams%20experiment">study</a> conducted in 1901 by physician <a href="Duncan%20MacDougall%20%28doctor%29">Duncan MacDougall</a> sought to measure the weight lost by a human when the <a href="soul">soul</a> "departed the body" upon death. MacDougall weighed dying patients in an attempt to prove that the soul was material, tangible and thus measurable. Although MacDougall's results varied considerably from "21 grams", for some people this figure has become synonymous with the measure of a soul's mass. The title of the 2003 movie "<a href="21%20Grams">21 Grams</a>" is a reference to MacDougall's findings. His results have never been reproduced, and are generally regarded either as meaningless or considered to have had little if any scientific merit.

<a href="Frank%20Tipler">Frank Tipler</a> has argued that <a href="physics">physics</a> can explain immortality, though such arguments are not <a href="Falsifiability">falsifiable</a> and thus do not qualify, in <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a>'s views, as science.

After 25 years of parapsychological research, <a href="Susan%20Blackmore">Susan Blackmore</a> came to the conclusion that there is no <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical evidence</a> for an afterlife.

There is still the position, based on the philosophical question of <a href="personal%20identity">personal identity</a>, termed <a href="open%20individualism">open individualism</a>, and in some ways similar to the old belief of <a href="monopsychism">monopsychism</a>, that concludes that individual existence is illusory, and our consciousness continues existing after death in other conscious beings. Positions regarding existence after death were supported by some notable physicists such as <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> and <a href="Freeman%20Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>.

Certain problems arise with the idea of a particular person continuing after death. <a href="Peter%20van%20Inwagen">Peter van Inwagen</a>, in his argument regarding resurrection, notes that the materialist must have some sort of physical continuity. <a href="John%20Hick">John Hick</a> also raises some questions regarding personal identity in his book, "Death and Eternal Life" using an example of a person ceasing to exist in one place while an exact replica appears in another. If the replica had all the same experiences, traits, and physical appearances of the first person, we would all attribute the same identity to the second, according to Hick.

In the <a href="panentheistic">panentheistic</a> model of <a href="process%20philosophy">process philosophy</a> and theology the writers <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a> and <a href="Charles%20Hartshorne">Charles Hartshorne</a> rejected that the universe was made of <a href="Matter">substance</a>, instead reality is composed of living experiences (occasions of experience). According to Hartshorne people do not experience subjective (or personal) immortality in the afterlife, but they do have objective immortality because their experiences live on forever in <a href="God">God</a>, who contains all that was. However other process philosophers such as <a href="David%20Ray%20Griffin">David Ray Griffin</a> have written that people may have subjective experience after death.

Regarding the <a href="mind%E2%80%93body%20problem">mind–body problem</a>, most neuroscientists take a <a href="physicalism">physicalist</a> position according to which consciousness derives from and/or is reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity occurring in the brain. The implication of this premise is that once the brain stops functioning at <a href="brain%20death">brain death</a>, consciousness fails to survive and <a href="eternal%20oblivion">ceases to exist</a>. In general, scientists and philosophers tend to practice increased skepticism when it comes to belief in life after death. 

Psychological proposals for the origin of a belief in an afterlife include cognitive disposition, cultural learning, and as an intuitive religious idea. In one study, children were able to recognize the ending of physical, mental, and perceptual activity in death, but were hesitant to conclude the ending of will, self, or emotion in death.

Astrometry

Astrometry is the branch of <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of <a href="star">star</a>s and other <a href="Astronomical%20object">celestial bodies</a>. The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the <a href="kinematics">kinematics</a> and physical origin of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> and our <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a>, the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

The history of astrometry is linked to the history of <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a>s, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a>, who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors <a href="Timocharis">Timocharis</a> and <a href="Aristillus">Aristillus</a> to discover Earth's <a href="precession">precession</a>. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today. Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions. Hipparchus's successor, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.

In the 10th century, <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Sufi">Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi</a> carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a>s and <a href="star%20color">star color</a>, and gave drawings for each constellation, in his "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Fixed%20Stars">pageRank.Book of Fixed Stars</a>". <a href="Ibn%20Yunus">Ibn Yunus</a> observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a> with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s were still used centuries later in <a href="Simon%20Newcomb">Simon Newcomb</a>'s investigations on the motion of the Moon, while his other observations inspired <a href="Laplace">Laplace</a>'s "Obliquity of the Ecliptic" and "Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn". In the 15th century, the <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid</a> astronomer <a href="Ulugh%20Beg">Ulugh Beg</a> compiled the "<a href="Zij-i-Sultani">Zij-i-Sultani</a>", in which he catalogued 1,019 stars. Like the earlier catalogs of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg's catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately 20 <a href="minutes%20of%20arc">minutes of arc</a>.

In the 16th century, <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> used improved instruments, including large <a href="mural%20instrument">mural instrument</a>s, to measure star positions more accurately than previously, with a precision of 15–35 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcsec</a>. <a href="Taqi%20al-Din%20Muhammad%20ibn%20Ma%27ruf">Taqi al-Din</a> measured the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> of the stars at the <a href="Istanbul%20observatory%20of%20Taqi%20al-Din">Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din</a> using the "observational clock" he invented. When <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s became commonplace, <a href="setting%20circles">setting circles</a> sped measurements

<a href="James%20Bradley">James Bradley</a> first tried to measure <a href="stellar%20parallax">stellar parallax</a>es in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his <a href="telescope">telescope</a>, but he instead discovered the <a href="aberration%20of%20light">aberration of light</a> and the <a href="astronomical%20nutation">nutation</a> of the Earth's axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by <a href="Friedrich%20Bessel">Friedrich Bessel</a>, the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcsec</a> for the <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> <a href="61%20Cygni">61 Cygni</a>.

Being very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the <a href="filar%20micrometer">filar micrometer</a>. <a href="Astrograph">Astrograph</a>s using astronomical <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a>s sped the process in the early 20th century. Automated plate-measuring machines and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of <a href="star%20catalogue">star catalogue</a>s. In the 1980s, <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a>s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond. This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.

In 1989, the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>'s <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and <a href="proper%20motions">proper motions</a> of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new "<a href="Hipparcos%20Catalogue">Tycho catalog</a>" drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">mas</a> (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>s also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.

Today, the catalogue most often used is <a href="Star%20catalogue%23USNO-B1.0">USNO-B1.0</a>, an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 <a href="Schmidt%20camera">Schmidt camera</a> plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.

Apart from the fundamental function of providing <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>s with a <a href="Frame%20of%20reference">reference frame</a> to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>, <a href="stellar%20dynamics">stellar dynamics</a> and <a href="galactic%20astronomy">galactic astronomy</a>. In <a href="observational%20astronomy">observational astronomy</a>, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> is basically the <a href="International%20Atomic%20Time">atomic time</a> synchronized to <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is an important step in the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a> because it establishes <a href="parallax">parallax</a> distance estimates for stars in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

Astrometry has also been used to support claims of <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Astrometry">extrasolar planet detection</a> by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Although, as of 2009, none of the extrasolar planets detected by ground-based astrometry has been verified in subsequent studies, astrometry is expected to be more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. NASA's planned <a href="Space%20Interferometry%20Mission">Space Interferometry Mission</a> (<a href="SIM%20PlanetQuest">SIM PlanetQuest</a>) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s orbiting 200 or so of the nearest <a href="Solar%20analog">solar-type stars</a>, and the European Space Agency's <a href="Gaia%20Mission">Gaia Mission</a>, launched in 2013, which will be applying astrometric techniques in its stellar census.

Astrometric measurements are used by <a href="astrophysicist">astrophysicist</a>s to constrain certain models in <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>. By measuring the velocities of <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a>s, it is possible to put a limit on the <a href="asymmetry">asymmetry</a> of <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> in the galaxy.

Astronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of <a href="near-Earth%20objects">near-Earth objects</a>. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth’s motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its <a href="orbital%20elements">orbital elements</a>, can be obtained.

<a href="50000%20Quaoar">50000 Quaoar</a> and <a href="90377%20Sedna">90377 Sedna</a> are two Solar System objects discovered in this way by <a href="Michael%20E.%20Brown">Michael E. Brown</a> and others at Caltech using the <a href="Palomar%20Observatory">Palomar Observatory</a>'s <a href="Samuel%20Oschin%20telescope">Samuel Oschin telescope</a> of and the Palomar-Quest large-area CCD camera. The ability of astronomers to track the positions and movements of such celestial bodies is crucial to the understanding of the Solar System and its interrelated past, present, and future with others in the Universe.

A fundamental aspect of astrometry is error correction. Various factors introduce errors into the measurement of stellar positions, including atmospheric conditions, imperfections in the instruments and errors by the observer or the measuring instruments. Many of these errors can be reduced by various techniques, such as through instrument improvements and compensations to the data. The results are then <a href="Error%20analysis%20%28mathematics%29">analyzed</a> using <a href="statistics">statistical methods</a> to compute data estimates and error ranges.

Athena

Athena (; <a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic Greek</a>: , "Athēnā", or , "Athēnaia"; <a href="Epic%20Greek">Epic</a>: , "Athēnaiē"; <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric</a>: , "Athānā") or Athene (; <a href="Ionic%20Greek">Ionic</a>: , "Athēnē"), often given the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> Pallas (; ), is the goddess of wisdom, craft, and war in <a href="ancient%20Greek%20religion">ancient Greek religion</a> and <a href="Greek%20mythology">mythology</a>. In later times, Athena was <a href="Interpretatio%20graeca">syncretized</a> with the <a href="Roman%20goddess">Roman goddess</a> <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>.

In <a href="ancient%20Greek%20literature">ancient Greek literature</a>, Athena is portrayed as the astute companion of <a href="hero">hero</a>es and as the patron <a href="goddess">goddess</a> of heroic endeavour. Athena probably takes her name from the city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, of which she was the patron. The Athenians constructed the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> atop their <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis</a> as a temple to Athena; it takes its name from her epithet "Parthenos", which means "<a href="Virginity">Virgin</a>". Throughout the Greek world, Athena was venerated as the protectress of the city ("<a href="polis">polis</a>"); she was known as "Polias" and "Poliouchos" and her temples were usually located atop the fortified <a href="Acropolis">Acropolis</a> in the central part of the city.

Athena is associated with the city of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. The name of the city in ancient Greek is "Ἀθῆναι" ("Athenai"), a plural <a href="toponym">toponym</a>, designating the place where—according to myth—she presided over her sisterhood, the "Athenai". In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena. Now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city; the ending -"ene" is common in names of locations, but rare for personal names. Testimonies from different cities in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> attest that similar <a href="city%20goddess">city goddess</a>es were worshipped in other cities and, like Athena, took their names from the cities where they were worshipped. For example, in <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> there was a goddess called Mykene, whose sisterhood was known as "Mykenai", whereas at <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> an analogous deity was called Thebe, and the city was known under the plural form "Thebai" (or Thebes, in English, where the ‘s’ is the plural formation). The name "Athenai" is likely of <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> origin because it contains the presumably Pre-Greek morpheme "*-ān-".

In his dialogue "<a href="Cratylus%20%28dialogue%29">Cratylus</a>", the Greek philosopher <a href="Plato">Plato</a> (428–347 BC) gives some rather imaginative etymologies of Athena's name, based on the theories of the ancient Athenians and his own etymological speculations:

Thus, Plato believed that Athena's name was derived from Greek , "Atheonóa"—which the later Greeks rationalised as from the deity's (θεός, "theós") mind (νοῦς, "noũs"). Other Greek authors attempted to derive natural symbols from the etymological roots of Athena's names to be "aether", "air", "earth", and "moon".

Athena was originally the <a href="Aegean%20civilization">Aegean</a> goddess of the palace, who presided over household crafts and protected the king. A single <a href="Mycenaean%20Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a> inscription "a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja" /Athana potnia/ appears at <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a> in the <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> tablets from the Late Minoan II-era "Room of the Chariot Tablets"; these comprise the earliest Linear B archive anywhere. Although "Athana potnia" often is translated "Mistress Athena", it could also mean "the "<a href="Potnia">Potnia</a>" of Athana", and thus perhaps "the Lady of Athens". However, any connection to the city of Athens in the Knossos inscription is uncertain. In the still undeciphered corpus of <a href="Linear%20A">Linear A</a> tablets—written in the unclassified <a href="Minoan%20language">Minoan language</a>—a sign series "a-ta-no-dju-wa-ja" is to be found. This could be connected with the Linear B Mycenaean expressions "a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja" and "di-u-ja" or "di-wi-ja" ("Diwia", "of Zeus" or, possibly, related to a <a href="List_of_Mycenaean_deities%23Goddesses">homonymous goddess</a>), resulting in a translation "Athena of Zeus" or "divine Athena". Similarly, in the Greek mythology and epic tradition, Athena figures as a daughter of Zeus (Διός θυγάτηρ; "cfr." <a href="Dyeus">Dyeus</a>). However, the inscription quoted seems to be very similar to "a-ta-nū-tī wa-ya", quoted as <a href="Kato%20Syme">SY</a> Za 1 by Jan Best. Best translates the initial "a-ta-nū-tī", which is recurrent in line beginnings, as "I have given".

In a <a href="Mycenea">Mycenea</a>n fresco, there is a composition of two women extending their hands towards a central figure, who is covered by an enormous figure-eight shield; this may depict the warrior-goddess with her <a href="Palladium%20%28classical%20antiquity%29">palladium</a>, or her palladium in an aniconic representation. In the "<a href="List%20of%20Aegean%20frescos">Procession Fresco</a>" at <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>, which was reconstructed by the Mycenaeans, two rows of figures carrying vessels seem to meet in front of a central figure, which is probably the Minoan precursor to Athena. The early twentieth-century scholar <a href="Martin%20P.%20Nilsson">Martin Persson Nilsson</a> argued that the <a href="Minoan%20snake%20goddess%20figurines">Minoan snake goddess figurines</a> are early representations of Athena.

Nilsson and others have claimed that, in early times, Athena was either an <a href="owl">owl</a> herself or a <a href="bird%20goddess">bird goddess</a> in general. In the third book of the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", she takes the form of a <a href="Sea%20eagle%20%28bird%29">sea-eagle</a>. Proponents of this view argue that she dropped her prophylactic owl-mask before she lost her wings. "Athena, by the time she appears in art," Jane Ellen Harrison remarks, "has completely shed her animal form, has reduced the shapes she once wore of snake and bird to attributes, but occasionally in <a href="Black%20figure%20pottery">black-figure vase-paintings</a> she still appears with wings."

It is generally agreed that the cult of Athena preserves some aspects of the Proto-Indo-European <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20religion%23Societal%20deities">transfunctional goddess</a>. The cult of Athena may have also been influenced by those of Near Eastern warrior goddesses such as the <a href="East%20Semitic">East Semitic</a> <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> and the <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>ic <a href="Anat">Anat</a>, both of whom were often portrayed bearing arms.

Miriam Robbins Dexter has suggested that, at least at some point in her history, Athena was a <a href="solar%20deity">solar deity</a>. Athena bears traits common with <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20religion">Indo-European</a> solar goddesses, including the possession of a mirror and the invention of weaving, characteristics which are also held by the Baltic goddess <a href="Saul%C4%97">Saulė</a>. Athena's association with Medusa, who is also suspected of being a solar goddess, adds further solar iconography to her cultus. Athena was later syncretized with <a href="Sulis">Sulis</a>, a Celtic goddess whose name is derived from the common Proto-Indo-European root for many solar deities. Though the sun in Greek myth is personified as the male <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, several relictual solar goddesses are known, such as <a href="Alectrona">Alectrona</a>.

Plato notes that the citizens of <a href="Sais">Sais</a> in Egypt worshipped a goddess known as <a href="Neith">Neith</a>, whom he identifies with Athena. Neith was the ancient Egyptian goddess of war and hunting, who was also associated with weaving; her worship began during the Egyptian Pre-Dynastic period. In Greek mythology, Athena was reported to have visited mythological sites in North Africa, including Libya's <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton River</a> and the <a href="Phlegra%20%28mythology%29">Phlegraean plain</a>. Based on these similarities, the <a href="sinologist">sinologist</a> <a href="Martin%20Bernal">Martin Bernal</a> created the "<a href="Black%20Athena">Black Athena</a>" hypothesis, which claimed that Neith was brought to Greece from Egypt, along with "an enormous number of features of civilization and culture in the third and second millennia". The "Black Athena" hypothesis stirred up widespread controversy near the end of the twentieth century, but it has now been widely rejected by modern scholars.

In her aspect of "Athena Polias", Athena was venerated as the goddess of the city and the protectress of the citadel. In Athens, the <a href="Plynteria">Plynteria</a>, or "Feast of the Bath", was observed every year at the end of the month of <a href="Thargelion">Thargelion</a>. The festival lasted for five days. During this period, the priestesses of Athena, or "plyntrídes", performed a cleansing ritual within the <a href="Erechtheion">Erechtheion</a>, a sanctuary devoted to Athena and Poseidon. Here Athena's statue was undressed, her clothes washed, and body purified.

Athena was worshipped at festivals such as <a href="Chalceia">Chalceia</a> as "Athena Ergane", the patroness of various crafts, especially <a href="weaving">weaving</a>. She was also the patron of metalworkers and was believed to aid in the forging of armor and weapons. During the late 5th century BC, the role of goddess of philosophy became a major aspect of Athena's <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a>.

As "<a href="Athena%20Promachos">Athena Promachos</a>", she was believed to lead soldiers into battle. Athena represented the disciplined, strategic side of war, in contrast to her brother <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the patron of violence, bloodlust, and slaughter—"the raw force of war". Athena was believed to only support those fighting for a just cause and was thought to view war primarily as a means to resolve conflict. In this aspect, Athena was also known as "<a href="Athena%20Parthenos">Parthenos</a>", which means "virgin", because she was believed to have never married or taken a lover. Athena was especially worshipped in this role during the festivals of the <a href="Panathenaea">Panathenaea</a> and <a href="Pamboeotia">Pamboeotia</a>, both of which prominently featured displays of athletic and military prowess. As the patroness of heroes and warriors, Athena was believed to favor those who used cunning and intelligence rather than brute strength.

Athena was not only the patron goddess of Athens, but also other cities, including <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, <a href="Gortyn">Gortyn</a>, <a href="Lindos">Lindos</a>, and <a href="Larisa">Larisa</a>. The various cults of Athena were all branches of her panhellenic cult and often proctored various initiation rites of Grecian youth, such as the passage into citizenship by young men or the passage of young women into marriage. These cults were portals of a uniform socialization, even beyond mainland Greece.

Athena was frequently equated with <a href="Aphaea">Aphaea</a>, a local goddess of the island of <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a>, originally from <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and also associated with <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> and the nymph <a href="Britomartis">Britomartis</a>. In <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, she was assimilated with the ancient goddess Alea and worshiped as <a href="Athena%20Alea">Athena Alea</a>. Sanctuaries dedicated to Athena Alea were located in the <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a>n towns of <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a> and <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>. The temple of Athena Alea in Tegea was an important religious center of ancient Greece. The geographer <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> was informed that the "temenos" had been founded by <a href="Aleus">Aleus</a>. Votive bronzes at the site from the Geometric and Archaic periods take the forms of horses and deer; there are sealstone and <a href="fibula">fibula</a>e. In the Archaic period, the nine villages that underlie Tegea banded together in a <a href="synoecism">synoecism</a> to form one city. Tegea was listed in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s <a href="Catalogue%20of%20Ships">Catalogue of Ships</a> as one of the cities that contributed ships and men for the <a href="War%20of%20Troy">Achaean assault on Troy</a>.

In Sparta, the temple of Athena "Khalkíoikos" (Athena "of the Brazen House", often <a href="latin">latin</a>ized as "Chalcioecus") was the grandest and located on the Spartan acropolis; presumably it had a roof of bronze. The forecourt of the Brazen House was the place where the most solemn religious functions in Sparta took place.

Athena was known as Atrytone ( "the Unwearying"), Parthenos ( "Virgin"), and Promachos ( "she who fights in front"). The epithet Polias (Πολιάς "of the city"), refers to Athena's role as protectress of the city. The epithet Ergane (Εργάνη "the Industrious") pointed her out as the patron of craftsmen and artisans. After serving as the judge at the trial of <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a> in which he was acquitted of having murdered his mother <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a>, Athena won the epithet Areia (Αρεία).

In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic works</a>, Athena's most common <a href="epithets%20in%20Homer">epithet</a> is Glaukopis (), which usually is translated as, "bright-eyed" or "with gleaming eyes". The word is a combination of "glaukós" (, meaning "gleaming, silvery", and later, "bluish-green" or "gray") and "ṓps" (, "eye, face"). The word "glaúx" (, "little owl") is from the same root, presumably according to some, because of the bird's own distinctive eyes. Athena was clearly associated with the owl from very early on; in archaic images, she is frequently depicted with an <a href="Owl%20of%20Athena">owl</a> perched on her hand. Through its association with Athena, the owl evolved into the national mascot of the Athenians and eventually became a symbol of wisdom.

Other epithets include <a href="Ageleia">Ageleia</a>, <a href="Itonia">Itonia</a> and Aethyia under which she was worshiped in <a href="Megara">Megara</a>. The word "aíthyia" () signifies a "diver", also some diving bird species (possibly the <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>) and figuratively, a "ship", so the name must reference Athena teaching the art of shipbuilding or navigation. In a temple at Phrixa in <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, reportedly built by <a href="Clymenus">Clymenus</a>, she was known as Cydonia (Κυδωνία), which is possibly connected to Greek "kũdos" (κῦδος "glory").

In the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" (4.514), the <a href="Homeric%20Hymns">Homeric Hymns</a>, and in <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>", Athena is also given the curious epithet Tritogeneia (Τριτογένεια), whose significance remains unclear. It could mean various things, including "Triton-born", perhaps indicating that the <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">homonymous sea-deity</a> was her parent according to some early myths. In fact there is a myth relating the foster father relationship of this Triton towards the half-orphan Athena, whom he raised besides his own daughter <a href="Pallas%20%28daughter%20of%20Triton%29">Pallas</a>. <a href="Karl%20Ker%C3%A9nyi">Karl Kerényi</a> suggests that "Tritogeneia did not mean that she came into the world on any particular river or lake, but that she was born of the water itself; for the name Triton seems to be associated with water generally." In <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" Athena is occasionally referred to as "Tritonia".

Another possible meaning may be "triple-born" or "third-born", which may refer to a triad or to her status as the third daughter of Zeus or the fact she was born from Metis, Zeus, and herself; various legends list her as being the first child after Artemis and Apollo, though other legends identify her as Zeus' first child. Several scholars have suggested a connection to the <a href="Rigveda">Rigvedic</a> god <a href="Trita">Trita</a>, who was sometimes grouped in a body of three mythological poets. Michael Janda has connected the myth of Trita to the scene in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" in which the "three brothers" Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades divide the world between them, receiving the "broad sky", the sea, and the underworld respectively. Janda further connects the myth of Athena being born of the head (i. e. the uppermost part) of Zeus, understanding "Trito-" (which perhaps originally meant "the third") as another word for "the sky". In Janda's analysis of Indo-European mythology, this heavenly sphere is also associated with the mythological body of water surrounding the inhabited world ("cfr." Triton's mother, <a href="Amphitrite">Amphitrite</a>).

She was given the epithet Hippia (Ἵππια "of the horses", "equestrian"), as the inventor of the <a href="chariot">chariot</a>, and was worshiped under this title at Athens, <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a> and <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>. As Athena Hippia she was given an alternative parentage: <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and Polyphe, daughter of <a href="Oceanus">Oceanus</a>. In each of these cities her temple frequently was the major temple on the acropolis.

The Greek biographer <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> (46–120 AD) refers to an instance during the Parthenon's construction of her being called Athena <a href="Hygieia">Hygieia</a> (Ὑγίεια, i. e. personified "Health"):

In <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a> Athena was also given the surname Alcis, meaning 'the strong'.

Although Athena appears before <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> at <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>—in <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a>, as , "a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja", "Mistress Athena"—in the Classical <a href="Olympian%20gods">Olympian pantheon</a>, Athena was remade as the favourite daughter of Zeus, born fully armed from his forehead. The story of her birth comes in several versions. In the version recounted by <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> in his "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>", Zeus lay with <a href="Metis">Metis</a>, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences because Gaia and <a href="Ouranos">Ouranos</a> had prophesized that Metis would bear children wiser than he himself. In order to prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis, but it was too late because Metis had already conceived.

Eventually Zeus experienced an enormous headache; <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, or Palaemon (depending on the sources examined) cleaved Zeus’ head with the double-headed <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> <a href="axe">axe</a>, the "<a href="labrys">labrys</a>". Athena leaped from Zeus's head, fully grown and armed, with a shout—"and pealed to the broad sky her clarion cry of war. And Ouranos trembled to hear, and Mother Gaia…" Plato, in the "<a href="Laws%20%28dialogue%29">Laws</a>", attributes the cult of Athena to the culture of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, introduced, he thought, from Libya during the dawn of Greek culture. Classical myths thereafter note that <a href="Hera">Hera</a> was so annoyed at Zeus for having produced a child that she conceived and bore <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> by <a href="parthenogenesis">herself</a>, but in "Imagines" <a href="https%3A//archive.org/stream/imagines00philuoft%23page/246/mode/2up">2. 27</a> (trans. Fairbanks), the third-century AD Greek rhetorician <a href="Philostratus%20the%20Elder">Philostratus the Elder</a> writes that Hera "rejoices" at Athena's birth "as though Athena were her daughter also."
In accordance with this mythological tradition, Plato, in "<a href="Cratylus">Cratylus</a>" (407B), gives the etymology of her name as signifying "the mind of god", "theou noesis". The second-century AD Christian apologist <a href="Justin%20Martyr">Justin Martyr</a> takes issue with those pagans who erect at springs images of <a href="Persephone">Kore</a>, whom he interprets as Athena:

They said that Athena was the daughter of Zeus not from intercourse, but when the god had in mind the making of a world through a word ("<a href="logos">logos</a>") his first thought was Athena.

A "<a href="scholium">scholium</a>" on the "Iliad" makes Athena the daughter of <a href="Cyclops">Brontes the Cyclops</a>, who seduced Metis and impregnated her, prompting Zeus to swallow her. The "<a href="Etymologicum%20Magnum">Etymologicum Magnum</a>" instead deems Athena the daughter of the <a href="Dactyl%20%28mythology%29">Daktyl</a> <a href="Itonus">Itonos</a>. Fragments attributed by the Christian <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> to the semi-legendary <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n historian <a href="Sanchuniathon">Sanchuniathon</a>, which Eusebius thought had been written before the <a href="Trojan%20war">Trojan war</a>, make Athena instead the daughter of <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a>, a king of <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> who visited 'the inhabitable world' and bequeathed <a href="Attica">Attica</a> to Athena. Sanchuniathon's account would make Athena the sister of Zeus and Hera, not Zeus' daughter.

The tradition regarding Athena's parentage involves some of her more mysterious <a href="epithet">epithet</a>s: Pallas, as in the ancient-Greek (also Pallantias) and Tritogeneia (also Trito, Tritonis, Tritoneia, Tritogenes). A distant archaic separate entity named Pallas is invoked as Athena's father, sister, foster sister, companion, or opponent in battle. One of these is <a href="Pallas%20%28daughter%20of%20Triton%29">Pallas</a>, a daughter of <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton</a> (a sea god) and, according to some later sources, a childhood friend of Athena.

In every case, Athena kills Pallas, accidentally, and thereby gains the name for herself. In one telling, they practice the arts of war together until one day they have a falling out. As Pallas is about to strike Athena, Zeus intervenes. With Pallas stunned by a blow from Zeus, Athena takes advantage and kills her. Distraught over what she has done, Athena takes the name Pallas for herself.

When Pallas is Athena's father, the events, including her birth, are located near a body of water named Triton or <a href="Lake%20Tritonis">Tritonis</a>. When Pallas is Athena's sister or foster-sister, Athena's father or foster-father is <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton</a>, the son and herald of <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>. Athena may be called the daughter of Poseidon and a nymph named Tritonis, without involving Pallas. Likewise, Pallas may be Athena's father or opponent, without involving Triton. On this topic, Walter Burkert says "she is the Pallas of Athens, "Pallas Athenaie", just as Hera of Argos is "Here Argeie". Burkert notes that the Athenians sometimes simply called Athena "the Goddess", "hē theós" (ἡ θεός), certainly an ancient title.

In fact, "Pallas" is derived either from , "brandish" (as a weapon), or, more likely, from and related words, "youth, young woman." The story that Athena kills a friend or relation called "Pallas" and takes the name to honor her is only attested quite late, in Apollodorus and Philodemus. It seems to have been invented to explain the name.

Athena never had a consort or lover and is thus known as "<a href="Athena%20Parthenos">Athena Parthenos</a>", "Virgin Athena". Her most famous temple, the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, on the <a href="Acropolis%2C%20Athens">Acropolis</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> takes its name from this title. It is not merely an observation of her virginity, but a recognition of her role as enforcer of rules of sexual modesty and ritual mystery. Even beyond recognition, the Athenians allotted the goddess value based on this pureness of virginity as it upheld a rudiment of female behavior in the patriarchal society. Kerényi's study and theory of Athena accredits her virginal epithet to be a result of the relationship to her father Zeus and a vital, cohesive piece of her character throughout the ages.

This role is expressed in a number of stories about Athena. <a href="Marinus%20of%20Neapolis">Marinus of Neapolis</a> reports that when Christians removed the statue of the Goddess from the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, a beautiful woman appeared in a dream to <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a>, a devotee of Athena, and announced that the ""Athenian Lady"" wished to dwell with him.

The ancient mythographer <a href="Pseudo-Apollodorus">Pseudo-Apollodorus</a> records an archaic legend, which claims that <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> once attempted to rape Athena, but she pushed him away, causing him to <a href="ejaculate">ejaculate</a> on her thigh. Athena wiped the <a href="semen">semen</a> off using a tuft of <a href="wool">wool</a>, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a> and causing her to give birth to <a href="Erichthonius%20of%20Athens">Erichthonius</a>, whom Athena adopted as her own child. The Roman mythographer <a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a> records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.

The geographer <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> records that Athena placed the infant Erichthonius into a small chest ("cista"), which she entrusted to the care of the three daughters of <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops</a>: <a href="Herse">Herse</a>, <a href="Pandrosos">Pandrosos</a>, and <a href="Aglaulus%2C%20daughter%20of%20Cecrops">Aglauros</a> of Athens. She warned the three sisters not the open the chest, but did not explain to them why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the <a href="Acropolis">Acropolis</a>, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent off the edge of the cliff instead. Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the <a href="Arrhephoria">Arrhephoria</a> festival.
Another version of the myth of the Athenian maidens is told in "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" by the Roman poet <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> (43 BC17 AD); in this late variant <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> falls in love with Herse. Herse, Aglaulus, and Pandrosus go to the temple to offer sacrifices to Athena. Hermes demands help from Aglaulus to seduce Herse. Aglaulus demands money in exchange. Hermes gives her the money the sisters have already offered to Athena. As punishment for Aglaulus's greed, Athena asks the goddess <a href="Invidia">Envy</a> to make Aglaulus jealous of Herse. When Hermes arrives to seduce Herse, Aglaulus stands in his way instead of helping him as she had agreed. He turns her to stone.

In a late myth, <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>, unlike her sister <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a>s, came to be viewed by the Greeks of the 5th century as a beautiful mortal that served as priestess in Athena's temple. Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and decided to rape her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way. Upon discovering the desecration of her temple, Athena changed Medusa's form to match that of her sister Gorgons as punishment. Medusa's hair turned into snakes, her lower body was transformed also, and meeting her gaze would turn any living man to stone. In the earliest myths, there is only one Gorgon, but there are two snakes that form a belt around her waist.

In one version of the <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a> myth, Tiresias stumbled upon Athena bathing, and he was struck blind by her to ensure he would never again see what man was not intended to see but having lost his eyesight, he was given a special gift—to be able to understand the language of the birds and thus foretell the future.

In a <a href="founding%20myth">founding myth</a> reported by <a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Pseudo-Apollodorus</a>, Athena competed with <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> for the patronage of Athens. They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops</a>, the king of Athens, would determine which gift was better. Poseidon struck the ground with his <a href="trident">trident</a> and a salt water spring sprang up; this gave the Athenians access to trade and water. Athens at its height was a significant sea power, defeating the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>—but the water was salty and undrinkable. In an alternative version of the myth from <a href="Vergil">Vergil</a>'s "<a href="Georgics">Georgics</a>", Poseidon instead gave the Athenians the first horse.

Athena offered the first domesticated <a href="olive%20tree">olive tree</a>. Cecrops accepted this gift and declared Athena the patron goddess of Athens. The olive tree brought wood, oil, and food, and became a symbol of Athenian economic prosperity. <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a> was of the opinion that "Poseidon's attempts to take possession of certain cities are political myths", which reflect the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal religions.

According to Pseudo-Apollodorus's "<a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Bibliotheca</a>", Athena guided the hero <a href="Perseus%20%28mythology%29">Perseus</a> in his quest to behead <a href="Medusa%20%28mythology%29">Medusa</a>. Other late sources report that she instructed <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> to skin the <a href="Nemean%20Lion">Nemean Lion</a> by using its own claws to cut through its thick hide. She also helped Heracles to defeat the <a href="Stymphalian%20Birds">Stymphalian Birds</a>, and to navigate the underworld so as to capture <a href="Cerberus">Cerberus</a>.

In "<a href="The%20Odyssey">The Odyssey</a>", <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>' cunning and shrewd nature quickly wins Athena's favour. For the first part of the poem, however, she largely is confined to aiding him only from "afar", mainly by implanting thoughts in his head during his journey home from Troy. Her guiding actions reinforce her role as the "protectress of heroes," or, as mythologian <a href="Walter%20Friedrich%20Otto">Walter Friedrich Otto</a> dubbed her, the "goddess of nearness," due to her mentoring and motherly probing. It is not until he washes up on the shore of the island of the <a href="Phaeacians">Phaeacians</a>, where <a href="Nausicaa">Nausicaa</a> is washing her clothes that Athena arrives personally to provide more tangible assistance. She appears in Nausicaa's dreams to ensure that the princess rescues Odysseus and plays a role in his eventual escort to Ithaca.

Athena appears to Odysseus upon his arrival, disguised as a herdsman; she initially lies and tells him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried and that he is believed to be dead, but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself. Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what he needs to know in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly beggar so that he will not be recognized by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.

Athena also appears to Odysseus's son Telemachos. Her actions lead him to travel around to Odysseus's comrades and ask about his father. He hears stories about some of Odysseus's journey. Athena's push for Telemachos's journey helps him grow into the man role, that his father once held.

She also plays a role in ending the resultant feud against the suitors' relatives. She instructs <a href="Laertes">Laertes</a> to throw his spear and to kill <a href="Eupeithes">Eupeithes</a>, the father of <a href="Antinous%20son%20of%20Eupeithes">Antinous</a>.

In one myth, all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a> and <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> (the eventual parents of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>). Only <a href="Eris%20%28mythology%29">Eris</a>, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, "for the fairest"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.

The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> prince. After bathing in the spring of <a href="Mount%20Ida">Mount Ida</a> where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. The goddesses undressed before him to be evaluated, either at his request or by their own choice.

Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, while Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite came forth and whispered to Paris that if he were to choose her as the fairest he would have the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen</a>, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> of <a href="Sparta%23Prehistory">Sparta</a>. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>.

The <a href="fable">fable</a> of <a href="Arachne">Arachne</a> is a late Roman addition to Classical <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> that does not appear in any Greek texts from the <a href="Classical%20Greece">Classical Era</a> or in the myth repertoire of the Attic vase-painters. Arachne's name means "spider" in ancient Greek. Arachne was the daughter of a famous dyer in <a href="Tyrian%20purple">Tyrian purple</a> in Hypaipa of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, and a weaving student of Athena. She became so conceited of her skill as a weaver that she began claiming that her skill was greater than that of Athena herself.

Athena gave Arachne a chance to redeem herself by assuming the form of an old woman and warning Arachne not to offend the deities. Arachne scoffed and wished for a weaving contest, so she could prove her skill.

Athena wove the scene of her victory over <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> that had inspired her patronage of Athens. According to Ovid's Latin narrative, Arachne's tapestry featured twenty-one episodes of the infidelity of the deities, including <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> being unfaithful with <a href="Leda%20%28mythology%29">Leda</a>, with <a href="Europa%20%28mythical%29">Europa</a>, and with <a href="Dana%C3%AB">Danaë</a>. Athena admitted that Arachne's work was flawless, but was outraged at Arachne's offensive choice of subjects that displayed the failings and transgressions of the deities. Finally, losing her temper, Athena destroyed Arachne's tapestry and loom, striking it with her shuttle.

Athena then struck Arachne with her staff, which changed her into a spider. In some versions, the destruction of her loom leads Arachne to hang herself in despair; Athena takes pity on her, and transforms her into a spider. In the aforementioned version, Arachne weaved scenes of joy while Athena weaved scenes of horror.

The fable suggests that the origin of weaving lay in imitation of spiders and that it was considered to have been perfected first in <a href="Anatolia">Asia Minor</a>.

Classically, Athena is portrayed wearing a full-length <a href="chiton%20%28costume%29">chiton</a>, and sometimes in armor, with her helmet raised high on the forehead to reveal the image of <a href="Nike%20%28mythology%29">Nike</a>. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis with the head of the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a>'s famous lost <a href="Chryselephantine">gold and ivory</a> statue of her, 36 m tall, the "<a href="Athena%20Parthenos">Athena Parthenos</a>" in the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. Athena also often is depicted with an <a href="owl">owl</a> sitting on one of her shoulders.

The "<a href="Mourning%20Athena">Mourning Athena</a>" is a relief sculpture that dates around 460 BC and portrays a weary Athena resting on a staff. In earlier, archaic portraits of Athena in <a href="black-figure%20pottery">black-figure pottery</a>, the goddess retains some of her Minoan-Mycenaean character, such as great bird wings although this is not true of archaic sculpture such as those of <a href="Aphaean%20Athena">Aphaean Athena</a>, where Athena has subsumed an earlier, invisibly numinous—"<a href="Aphaea">Aphaea</a>"—goddess with Cretan connections in her "mythos".

Apart from her attributes, there seems to be a relative consensus in late sculpture from the Classical period, the 5th century onward, as to what Athena looked like. Most noticeable in the face is perhaps the full round strong, chin with a high nose that has a high bridge as a natural extension of the forehead. The eyes typically are somewhat deeply set. The unsmiling lips are usually full, but the mouth is depicted fairly narrow, usually just slightly wider than the nose. The neck is somewhat long. The net result is a serene, serious, somewhat aloof, and very classical beauty.

Early Christian writers such as <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> and <a href="Firmicus">Firmicus</a> denigrated Athena as representative of all the things that were detestable about paganism; they condemned her as "immodest and immoral". During the Middle Ages, however, many attributes of Athena were given to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, who, in fourth century portrayals, was often depicted wearing the <a href="Gorgoneion">Gorgoneion</a>. Some even viewed the Virgin Mary as a warrior maiden, much like Athena Parthenos; one anecdote tells that the Virgin Mary once appeared upon the walls of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> when it was under siege by the Avars, clutching a spear and urging the people to fight. During the Middle Ages, Athena became widely used as a Christian symbol and allegory; she appeared on the family crests of certain noble houses.

During the Renaissance, Athena donned the mantle of patron of the arts and human endeavor; allegorical paintings involving Athena were a favorite of the Italian Renaissance painters. During the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not. Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the <a href="Place%20de%20la%20Revolution">Place de la Revolution</a> in Paris. In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.

For over a century, <a href="Parthenon%20%28Nashville%29">a full-scale replica of the Parthenon</a> has stood in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. In 1990, the curators added a gilded forty-two foot (12.5 m) tall <a href="Athena%20Parthenos">replica of Phidias's "Athena Parthenos"</a>, built from concrete and fiberglass. The state <a href="seal%20of%20California">seal of California</a> features an image of Athena (or Minerva) kneeling next to a brown grizzly bear.

Athena is a natural patron of universities: she is the symbol of the <a href="Darmstadt%20University%20of%20Technology">Darmstadt University of Technology</a>, in Germany, and the <a href="Universidade%20Federal%20do%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Federal University of Rio de Janeiro</a>, in Brazil. Her image can be found in the shields of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and the Faculty of Sciences of the <a href="National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico">National Autonomous University of Mexico</a>, where her owl is the symbol of the Faculty of Chemistry. Her helmet appears upon the shield of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. At <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> in Pennsylvania a statue of Athena (a replica of the original bronze one in the arts and archaeology library) resides in the Great Hall. It is traditional at exam time for students to leave offerings to the goddess with a note asking for good luck, or to repent for accidentally breaking any of the college's numerous other traditions. Athena's owl also serves as the mascot of the college, and one of the college hymns is "Pallas Athena". Pallas Athena is the tutelary goddess of the international social fraternity <a href="Phi%20Delta%20Theta">Phi Delta Theta</a>. Her owl is also a symbol of the fraternity.

<a href="Jean%20Boucher%20%28artist%29">Jean Boucher</a>'s statue of the seated skeptical thinker <a href="Ernest%20Renan">Ernest Renan</a> caused great controversy when it was installed in Tréguier, <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> in 1902. Renan's 1862 biography of Jesus had denied his divinity, and he had written the "<a href="http%3A//www.lexilogos.com/document/renan/acropolis.htm">Prayer on the Acropolis</a>" addressed to the goddess Athena. The statue was placed in the square fronted by the cathedral. Renan's head was turned away from the building, while Athena, beside him, was depicted raising her arm, which was interpreted as indicating a challenge to the church during an anti-clerical phase in French official culture. The installation was accompanied by a mass protest from local Roman Catholics and a religious service against the growth of <a href="skepticism">skepticism</a> and <a href="secularism">secularism</a>.

Athena has been used numerous times as a symbol of a republic by different countries and appears on currency as she did on the ancient <a href="drachma">drachma</a> of Athens.
Athena (Minerva) is the subject of the $50 1915-S Panama-Pacific <a href="commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a>. At 2.5 troy oz (78 g) gold, this is the largest (by <a href="weight">weight</a>) coin ever produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">U.S. Mint</a>. This was the first $50 coin issued by the U.S. Mint and no higher was produced until the production of the $100 platinum coins in 1997. Of course, in terms of face-value in adjusted dollars, the 1915 is the highest denomination ever issued by the U.S. Mint.

The Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game is a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> created and written by <a href="Erick%20Wujcik">Erick Wujcik</a>, set in the <a href="fictional%20universe">fictional universe</a> created by author <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> for his "<a href="Chronicles%20of%20Amber">Chronicles of Amber</a>". The game is unusual in that no <a href="dice">dice</a> are used in resolving conflicts or player actions; instead a simple <a href="diceless%20role-playing%20game">diceless</a> system of comparative ability, and narrative description of the action by the players and <a href="gamemaster">gamemaster</a>, is used to determine how situations are resolved.

"Amber DRPG" was created in the 1980s, and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era. Most "Amber" characters are members of the two ruling classes in the "Amber" <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">multiverse</a>, and are much more advanced in matters of strength, endurance, psyche, warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings. This often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family, a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue.

The original 256-page game book was published in 1991 by <a href="Phage%20Press">Phage Press</a>, covering material from the first five novels (the "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%23The%20Corwin%20cycle">Corwin Cycle</a>") and some details – sorcery and the <a href="Logrus">Logrus</a> – from the remaining five novels (the "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%23The%20Merlin%20Cycle">Merlin Cycle</a>"), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos. Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice – for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which <a href="Merlin%20%28The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%29">Merlin</a> says is impossible; and players' <a href="psychic">psychic</a> abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.
A 256-page companion volume, "Shadow Knight", was published in 1993. This supplemental <a href="wikt%3Arulebook">rule book</a> includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin's Ghostwheel. The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series' <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> but as an example of a <a href="Campaign%20%28role-playing%20games%29">roleplaying campaign</a> with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books. The book includes some material from the short story <a href="Amber%20Short%20Stories">"The Salesman's Tale,"</a> and some unpublished material cut from "<a href="Prince%20of%20Chaos">Prince of Chaos</a>", notably Coral's pregnancy by Merlin.

Both books were translated into French and published by <a href="Jeux%20Descartes">Jeux Descartes</a> in 1994 and 1995.

A third book, "Rebma", was promised. Cover art was commissioned and pre-orders were taken, but it never arrived. Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos. The publishing rights to the "Amber DRPG" games were acquired in 2004 by <a href="Guardians%20of%20Order">Guardians of Order</a>, who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game. However, no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006. The two existing books are now <a href="out-of-print">out-of-print</a>, but they have been made available as <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">PDF</a> downloads.

In June 2007 a new publishing company, headed by Edwin Voskamp and Eric Todd, was formed with the express purpose of bringing "Amber DRPG" back into print. The new company is named "Diceless by Design".

In May 2010, "Rite Publishing" secured a license from Diceless by Design to use the rules system with a new setting in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran Jason Durall. The project Lords of Gossamer & Shadow (Diceless) was funded via <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> in May 2013. In Sept 2013 the project was completed, and on in Nov 2013 Lords of Gossamer and Shadow (Diceless) was released publicly in full-color Print and PDF, along with additional supplements and continued support.

The game is set in the <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">multiverse</a> described in Zelazny's "Chronicles of Amber". The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, "<a href="The%20Courts%20of%20Chaos">The Courts of Chaos</a>", but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny's cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The "Amber" multiverse consists of Amber, a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found <a href="The%20Pattern%20%28The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%29">the Pattern</a>, the symbol of <a href="%3Awikt%3Aorder">Order</a>; The Courts of Chaos, an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found <a href="the%20Logrus">the Logrus</a>, the manifestation of <a href="Chaos%20%28cosmogony%29">Chaos</a>, and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and Shadow, the collection of all possible <a href="universe">universe</a>s (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.

It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books – the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites – or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon's death "before" the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an "<a href="Amethyst">Amethyst</a>" game. A third option is to have the players portray <a href="Corwin%20%28The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%29">Corwin</a>'s children, in an Amber-like city built around Corwin's pattern; this is sometimes called an "<a href="Argent">Argent</a>" game, since one of Corwin's <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> colours is <a href="Silver">Silver</a>.

Characters in "Amber DRPG" are represented by four <a href="attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">attributes</a>: "Psyche", "Strength", "Endurance" and "Warfare".
The attributes run from −25 (normal human level), through −10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are "ranked", with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered "superior" in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small. All else being equal, a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute.

A character's ability scores are purchased during <a href="character%20creation">character creation</a> in an <a href="auction">auction</a>; players get 100 <a href="character%20point">character point</a>s, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is "ranked" first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is "superior" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.

The Auction simulates a 'history' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong, mighty warrior, but being "outplayed" in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another player's bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force one's opponents to back down. With two or more equally determined players, this can result in a "bidding war" where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a player's determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.

Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong <a href="telepathic">telepathic</a> abilities, being able to <a href="hypnotise">hypnotise</a> and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the "Chronicles": first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when <a href="Corwin%20%28The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber%29">Corwin</a> faces the demon Strygalldwir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos. However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; the combination of Brand's "living trump" powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. "Shadow Knight" does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the "living trump" abilities as somewhat limited.

Characters in "Amber DRPG" have access to the powers seen in the "Chronicles of Amber": "Pattern", "Logrus", "Shape-shifting", "Trump", and "magic".


Each of the first four powers is available in an advanced form.

While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues – unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character's legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) "real" and therefore useful. The expansion, "Shadow Knight", adds Constructs – artifacts with connections to shadows.

Unspent character points become good stuff – a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming bad stuff – bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character: characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions, while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility.

As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's <a href="alignment%20%28role-playing%20games%29">outlook on the universe</a>: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.

In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key words here are "fair" and "eventually" – if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.

"Amber DRPG" advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit – even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.

Despite the game's <a href="out-of-print">out-of-print</a> status, a thriving <a href="fan%20convention">convention</a> scene exists supporting the game. Amber conventions, known as "Ambercons", are held yearly in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a> (United States), <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> (England) and <a href="Modena%2C%20Italy">Modena, Italy</a>. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated "Amber DRPG" magazine called "Amberzine". Some "Amberzine" issues are still available from Phage Press.

Alloy

An alloy is a mixture of <a href="metal">metal</a>s or a mixture of a metal and another <a href="Chemical%20element">element</a>. Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character. An alloy may be a <a href="solid%20solution">solid solution</a> of metal elements (a single phase) or a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions). <a href="Intermetallic">Intermetallic</a> compounds are alloys with a defined <a href="stoichiometry">stoichiometry</a> and crystal structure. <a href="Zintl%20phase">Zintl phase</a>s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see also: <a href="Van%20Arkel-Ketelaar%20triangle">Van Arkel-Ketelaar triangle</a> for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds).

Alloys are used in a wide variety of applications. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are <a href="steel">steel</a>, <a href="solder">solder</a>, <a href="brass">brass</a>, <a href="pewter">pewter</a>, <a href="duralumin">duralumin</a>, <a href="bronze">bronze</a> and <a href="Amalgam%20%28chemistry%29">amalgam</a>s.

The alloy constituents are usually measured by mass. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or <a href="interstitial%20alloy">interstitial alloy</a>s, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or <a href="intermetallic">intermetallic</a>.

An alloy is a mixture of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a <a href="metal">metal</a>. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be <a href="solubility">soluble</a> and dissolve into the mixture.
The mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft (<a href="malleability">malleable</a>), such as <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as <a href="copper">copper</a>. Although both metals are very soft and <a href="ductility">ductile</a>, the resulting <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminium alloy</a> will have much greater <a href="strength%20of%20materials">strength</a>. Adding a small amount of non-metallic <a href="carbon">carbon</a> to <a href="iron">iron</a> trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called <a href="steel">steel</a>. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial <a href="toughness">toughness</a>, and its ability to be greatly altered by <a href="heat%20treatment">heat treatment</a>, steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding <a href="chromium">chromium</a> to steel, its resistance to <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> can be enhanced, creating <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>, while adding <a href="silicon">silicon</a> will alter its electrical characteristics, producing <a href="silicon%20steel">silicon steel</a>.

Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the <a href="liquid">liquid</a> state, they may not always be soluble in the <a href="solid">solid</a> state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a <a href="solid%20solution">solid solution</a>, becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a <a href="phase%20%28matter%29">phase</a>. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous <a href="microstructure">microstructure</a> of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other phase has. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are <a href="supersaturation">supersaturated</a> with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice, becoming more stable, and form a second phase that serve to reinforce the crystals internally. 
Some alloys, such as <a href="electrum">electrum</a> which is an alloy consisting of <a href="silver">silver</a> and <a href="gold">gold</a>, occur naturally. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, which is a mixture of the metals <a href="tin">tin</a> and <a href="copper">copper</a>. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires (<a href="smelting">smelting</a>) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include <a href="pewter">pewter</a>, <a href="brass">brass</a> and <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a>. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. <a href="Carbon%20steel">Carbon steel</a> can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like <a href="mild%20steel">mild steel</a> or hard alloys like <a href="spring%20steel">spring steel</a>. <a href="Alloy%20steel">Alloy steel</a>s can be made by adding other elements, such as <a href="chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> or <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, resulting in alloys such as <a href="high-speed%20steel">high-speed steel</a> or <a href="tool%20steel">tool steel</a>. Small amounts of <a href="manganese">manganese</a> are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, <a href="titanium%20alloy">titanium</a>, <a href="nickel%20alloys">nickel</a>, and <a href="magnesium%20alloy">magnesium alloy</a>s. Some modern <a href="superalloy">superalloy</a>s, such as <a href="incoloy">incoloy</a>, <a href="inconel">inconel</a>, and <a href="hastelloy">hastelloy</a>, may consist of a multitude of different elements.

As a noun, the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. When used as a verb, the term refers to the act of mixing a metal with other elements. The primary metal is called the "base", the "matrix", or the "<a href="solvent">solvent</a>". The secondary constituents are often called "solutes". If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a <a href="copper-nickel">copper-nickel</a> alloy, then it is called a "binary alloy." If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a "ternary alloy." An alloy with four constituents is a "quaternary alloy," while a five-part alloy is termed a "quinary alloy." Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a "system". In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a "binary system," while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a "ternary system".

Although an alloy is technically an impure metal, when referring to alloys, the term "impurities" usually denotes those elements which are not desired. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form <a href="iron%20sulfide">iron sulfide</a>, which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel. <a href="Lithium">Lithium</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="calcium">calcium</a> are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the <a href="structural%20integrity">structural integrity</a> of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called "impure metals" and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form <a href="metal%20oxide">metal oxide</a>s; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using <a href="flux%20%28metallurgy%29">fluxes</a>, chemical additives, or other methods of <a href="extractive%20metallurgy">extractive metallurgy</a>.

In practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 <a href="Karat%20%28purity%29">karat</a> <a href="gold">gold</a> is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the <a href="silver">silver</a> used in <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a> and the <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> used as a structural building material are also alloys.

The term "alloy" is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminium alloy</a> are commonly referred to as simply "<a href="alloy%20wheel">alloy wheel</a>s", although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. Steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it, like <a href="wheel">wheel</a>s, <a href="barrel">barrel</a>s, or <a href="girder">girder</a>s, are simply referred to by the name of the item, assuming it is made of steel. When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.: "bronze wheel", "plastic barrel", or "wood girder").

Alloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces <a href="steel">steel</a>, which is stronger than <a href="iron">iron</a>, its primary element. The <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical</a> and <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a> of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as <a href="density">density</a>, <a href="Reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a>, <a href="Young%27s%20modulus">Young's modulus</a> of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as <a href="tensile%20strength">tensile strength</a>, ductility, and <a href="shear%20strength">shear strength</a> may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the <a href="atom">atom</a>s in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting <a href="ferromagnetic">ferromagnetic</a> alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.
Some alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. <a href="Bronze">Bronze</a>, an alloy of <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a>, was the first alloy discovered, during the <a href="prehistory">prehistoric</a> period now known as the <a href="bronze%20age">bronze age</a>. It was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for <a href="ornament%20%28architecture%29">ornaments</a>, <a href="bell">bell</a>s, <a href="statue">statue</a>s, and <a href="bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearings</a>. <a href="Brass">Brass</a> is an alloy made from <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>.

Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>, but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of <a href="solid">solid</a> and <a href="liquid">liquid</a> phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the <a href="solidus%20%28chemistry%29">solidus</a>, and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the <a href="liquidus">liquidus</a>. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a <a href="eutectic">eutectic</a> mixture or a peritectic composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.

Alloying elements are added to a base metal, to induce <a href="hardness">hardness</a>, <a href="toughness">toughness</a>, <a href="ductility">ductility</a>, or other desired properties. Most metals and alloys can be <a href="work%20hardening">work hardened</a> by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during <a href="plastic%20deformation">plastic deformation</a> by hammering, bending, extruding, etcetera, and are permanent unless the metal is <a href="recrystallization%20%28metallurgy%29">recrystallized</a>. Otherwise, some alloys can also have their properties altered by <a href="heat%20treatment">heat treatment</a>. Nearly all metals can be softened by <a href="annealing%20%28metallurgy%29">annealing</a>, which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, and <a href="nickel">nickel</a> can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree as does <a href="steel">steel</a>.

The base metal iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, undergoes a change in the arrangement (<a href="allotropy">allotropy</a>) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between and , depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a> happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in "<a href="solid%20solution">solution</a>" in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called <a href="austenite">austenite</a>. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as <a href="solubility">soluble</a> with the iron, and will be forced to <a href="precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitate</a> out of solution, <a href="nucleating">nucleating</a> into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (FeC) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called <a href="cementite">cementite</a> (or <a href="carbide">carbide</a>), and pure iron <a href="ferrite%20%28iron%29">ferrite</a>. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a <a href="diffusionless%20transformation">diffusionless (martensite) transformation</a> occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).

While the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martinsite), most heat-treatable alloys are <a href="precipitation%20hardening">precipitation hardening</a> alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming <a href="intermetallic">intermetallic</a> phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.

When a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called "atom exchange" and the "interstitial mechanism". The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a "substitutional alloy". Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively. In the case of the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other and can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal. Instead, the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms of the crystal matrix, called the "interstices". This is referred to as an "interstitial alloy". Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. <a href="Stainless%20steel">Stainless steel</a> is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms.

The use of alloys by humans started with the use of <a href="meteoric%20iron">meteoric iron</a>, a naturally occurring alloy of <a href="nickel">nickel</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a>. It is the main constituent of <a href="iron%20meteorite">iron meteorite</a>s which occasionally fall down on Earth from outer space. As no metallurgic processes were used to separate iron from nickel, the alloy was used as it was. Meteoric iron could be forged from a red heat to make objects such as tools, weapons, and nails. In many cultures it was shaped by cold hammering into knives and arrowheads. They were often used as anvils. Meteoric iron was very rare and valuable, and difficult for ancient people to work.

Iron is usually found as <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> on Earth, except for one deposit of <a href="native%20iron">native iron</a> in <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, which was used by the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> people. Native <a href="copper">copper</a>, however, was found worldwide, along with <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, and <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, which were also used to make tools, jewelry, and other objects since Neolithic times. Copper was the hardest of these metals, and the most widely distributed. It became one of the most important metals to the ancients. Eventually, humans learned to <a href="smelting">smelt</a> metals such as copper, and <a href="tin">tin</a> from <a href="ore">ore</a>, and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, which was much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain. In the Middle East, people began alloying copper with <a href="zinc">zinc</a> to form <a href="brass">brass</a>. Ancient civilizations took into account the mixture and the various properties it produced, such as <a href="hardness">hardness</a>, <a href="toughness">toughness</a> and <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>, under various conditions of <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and <a href="work%20hardening">work hardening</a>, developing much of the information contained in modern <a href="Phase%20diagram">alloy phase diagram</a>s. Arrowheads from the Chinese <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a> (around 200 BC) were often constructed with a hard bronze-head, but a softer bronze-tang, combining the alloys to prevent both dulling and breaking during use.

<a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">Mercury</a> has been smelted from <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a> for thousands of years. Mercury dissolves many metals, such as gold, silver, and tin, to form <a href="amalgam%20%28chemistry%29">amalgam</a>s (an alloy in a soft paste or liquid form at ambient temperature). Amalgams have been used since 200 BC in China for <a href="gilding">gilding</a> objects such as <a href="armor">armor</a> and <a href="mirror">mirror</a>s with precious metals. The ancient Romans often used mercury-tin amalgams for gilding their armor. The amalgam was applied as a paste and then heated until the mercury vaporized, leaving the gold, silver, or tin behind. Mercury was often used in mining, to extract precious metals like gold and silver from their ores.

Many ancient civilizations alloyed metals for purely aesthetic purposes. In ancient <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>, gold was often alloyed with copper to produce red-gold, or iron to produce a bright burgundy-gold. Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of <a href="colored%20gold">colored gold</a>. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes. Copper was often added to silver to make <a href="sterling%20silver">sterling silver</a>, increasing its strength for use in dishes, silverware, and other practical items. Quite often, precious metals were alloyed with less valuable substances as a means to deceive buyers. Around 250 BC, <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> was commissioned by the king to find a way to check the purity of the gold in a crown, leading to the famous bath-house shouting of "Eureka!" upon the discovery of <a href="Archimedes%27%20principle">Archimedes' principle</a>.

The term <a href="pewter">pewter</a> covers a variety of alloys consisting primarily of tin. As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to be used for any practical purpose. However, during the <a href="Bronze%20age">Bronze age</a>, tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean, due to this it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewelry, cutlery, or other objects from tin, it was usually alloyed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness. These metals were typically <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.

The earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East. The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in <a href="shinto">shinto</a> shrines.

The first known smelting of iron began in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, around 1800 BC. Called the <a href="bloomery">bloomery process</a>, it produced very soft but <a href="ductile">ductile</a> <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a>. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. <a href="Pig%20iron">Pig iron</a>, a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, was being produced in <a href="History%20of%20China%23Shang%20Dynasty%20%28c.%201700%E2%80%931046%20BC%29">China</a> as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making <a href="cast-iron">cast-iron</a>. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of <a href="crucible%20steel">crucible steel</a> around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of <a href="pattern%20welding">pattern welding</a>, around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove <a href="slag">slag</a> and impurities. This method of <a href="Japanese%20swordsmithing">Japanese swordsmithing</a> produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early Middle Ages.

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of <a href="steel">steel</a>, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by <a href="heat%20treatment">heat treatment</a> had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of <a href="blister%20steel">blister steel</a> during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, <a href="Benjamin%20Huntsman">Benjamin Huntsman</a> began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of <a href="tool%20steel">tool steel</a>. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.

With the introduction of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the <a href="liquid">liquid</a> pig iron to create steel. <a href="Puddling%20%28metallurgy%29">Puddling</a> was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a>. In 1858, <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Bessemer">Sir Henry Bessemer</a> developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow. <a href="Mangalloy">Mangalloy</a>, an alloy of steel and <a href="manganese">manganese</a> exhibiting extreme hardness and toughness, was one of the first <a href="alloy%20steel">alloy steel</a>s, and was created by <a href="Robert%20Hadfield">Robert Hadfield</a> in 1882.

In 1906, <a href="precipitation%20hardening">precipitation hardening</a> alloys were discovered by <a href="Alfred%20Wilm">Alfred Wilm</a>. Precipitation hardening alloys, such as certain alloys of <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, and copper, are heat-treatable alloys that soften when <a href="quenching">quenched</a> (cooled quickly), and then harden over time. After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, <a href="duralumin">duralumin</a> was one of the first "age hardening" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>.

Artistic revolution

Throughout history, forms of <a href="art">art</a> have gone through periodic abrupt changes called artistic revolutions. Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways. See also <a href="cultural%20movement">cultural movement</a>s.

The role of <a href="fine%20art">fine art</a> has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.

Artists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.

No art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism – a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.

Examples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:


<a href="http%3A//www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg">Here</a> is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces

But not all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists. The stylistic revolution known as <a href="Impressionism">Impressionism</a>, by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.

<a href="Eugene%20Chevreul">Eugene Chevreul</a>, a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works, began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics. Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other. The French painter Eugène Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones, embraced Chevreul's book, "The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum. Inspired by Chevreul’s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer’s eye to combine them optically.

They were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance, painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out. in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored. Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.

Paints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world, to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment. Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments - chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of "impressionists" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.

Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, “Without colors in tubes, there would be no Cézanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.”

Finally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s. It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings. The neo-classical subject matter, limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light - not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events. Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.

Their initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the <a href="Abstract%20Expressionists">Abstract Expressionists</a> who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war. At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in "my four year old could do that"—these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's, expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood. <a href="Jackson%20Pollock">Jackson Pollock</a> who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.

In fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones, abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc. "It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, " said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995. Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, "If that's art, I'm a Hottentot." Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.

Key dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE
Ancient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.
Classical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.
Byzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.

Key dates: 400CE
Medieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.
Gothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.
First developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.

Key dates: 14th century
This movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht Dürer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. 
Representative artists:
Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.

Key dates: 1520-1600
Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. 
Representative artists:
Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio

Key dates: 17th century
Baroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.
This movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.
One of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Vermeer.
In the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.
Representative artists:
Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin

Key dates: 18th century
Throughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word "rocaille", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.
François Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. 
Characterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.
The Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.
Representative artists:
François Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Velázquez Vermeer

Key dates: 1750-1880
A nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.
Representative artists:
Jacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin

Key dates: 1800-1880
Romanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.
Although Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.
Great artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.
In the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.
Obvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. 
Representative artists:
George Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eugène Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner

Agrarianism

Agrarianism is a <a href="social%20philosophy">social philosophy</a> or <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> which values rural society as superior to urban society, the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values. It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life.

<a href="M.%20Thomas%20Inge">M. Thomas Inge</a> defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:

The philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of <a href="Agriculturalism">Agriculturalism</a> (农家/農家) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian <a href="communalism">communalism</a> and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon. That influenced European intellectuals like <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Quesnay">François Quesnay</a>, an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of <a href="physiocracy">physiocracy</a>. The physiocrats, along with the ideas of <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and the <a href="Romantic%20Era">Romantic Era</a>, formed the basis of modern European and American agrarianism.

United States president (1801–1809) <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> was a representative agrarian who built <a href="Jeffersonian%20democracy">Jeffersonian democracy</a> around the notion that farmers are “the most valuable citizens” and the truest <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicans</a>.

Peasant parties first appeared across Eastern Europe between 1860 and 1910, when commercialized agriculture and world market forces disrupted traditional rural society, and the railway and growing literacy facilitated the work of roving organizers. Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.

Peasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International (<a href="International%20Agrarian%20Bureau">International Agrarian Bureau</a>) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.

The <a href="Farmers%27%20Voice%20Party">Farmers' Voice Party</a> won a seat in the district of <a href="Jendouba%20Governorate">Jendouba</a> after the <a href="Tunisian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202014">parliamentary election of 2014</a>.

In Bulgaria, the <a href="Bulgarian%20Agrarian%20National%20Union">Bulgarian Agrarian National Union</a> (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, <a href="Aleksandar%20Stamboliyski">Aleksandar Stamboliyski</a> (1879–1923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.

In <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Agricultural%20and%20Smallholder%20People">Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People</a> often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party pětka coalition. The party's leader, <a href="Antonin%20Svehla">Antonin Svehla</a> (1873–1933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters.The party was banned by the <a href="National%20Front%20%28Czechoslovakia%29">National Front</a> after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

In <a href="France">France</a>, the <a href="Hunting%2C%20Fishing%2C%20Nature%2C%20Tradition">Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition</a> party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4,23% in the <a href="French%20presidential%20election%2C%202002">French presidential election, 2002</a>. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, <a href="Union%20for%20a%20Popular%20Movement">Union for a Popular Movement</a>.

In the late 19th century, the <a href="Irish%20National%20Land%20League">Irish National Land League</a> aimed to abolish <a href="landlordism">landlordism</a> in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The "<a href="Land%20War">Land War</a>" of 1878–1909 led to the <a href="Irish%20Land%20Acts">Irish Land Acts</a>, ending such iniquities as <a href="absentee%20landlords">absentee landlords</a>, <a href="ground%20rent">ground rent</a> and redistributing land among peasant farmers.

Post-independence, the <a href="Farmers%27%20Party%20%28Ireland%29">Farmers' Party</a> operated in the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> from 1922, folding into the <a href="National%20Centre%20Party%20%28Ireland%29">National Centre Party</a> in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.

<a href="Clann%20na%20Talmhan">Clann na Talmhan</a> (Family of the Land; also called the "National Agricultural Party") were founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting <a href="land%20reclamation">land reclamation</a>, <a href="afforestation">afforestation</a>, <a href="social%20democracy">social democracy</a> and <a href="rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the <a href="Government%20of%20the%2013th%20D%C3%A1il">Government of the 13th Dáil</a> and <a href="Government%20of%20the%2015th%20D%C3%A1il">Government of the 15th Dáil</a>. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other party and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.

In Latvia, the <a href="Union%20of%20Greens%20and%20Farmers">Union of Greens and Farmers</a> is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.

In Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the <a href="Lithuanian%20Farmers%20and%20Greens%20Union">Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union</a>, under the leadership of industrial farmer <a href="Ram%C5%ABnas%20Karbauskis">Ramūnas Karbauskis</a>.

In <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Party">Polish People's Party</a> traces its tradition to an agrarian party in <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a>-controlled <a href="Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Galician Poland</a>. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in <a href="Polish%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201993">1993 elections</a>, where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadly declined.

In <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, older parties from <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> merged to become the <a href="National%20Peasants%27%20Party">National Peasants' Party</a> in 1926. <a href="Iuliu%20Maniu">Iuliu Maniu</a> (1873–1953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928–1930 and briefly in 1932–1933, but the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> made proposed reforms impossible. The <a href="Communist%20Romania">communist regime</a> dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.

The <a href="Christian%20Democratic%20National%20Peasants%27%20Party">reformed party</a>, which also incorporated elements of <a href="Christian%20democracy">Christian democracy</a> in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the <a href="Romanian%20Democratic%20Convention">Romanian Democratic Convention</a> between 1996–2000.

In Serbia, <a href="Nikola%20Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikola Pašić</a> (1845–1926) and his <a href="People%27s%20Radical%20Party">People's Radical Party</a> dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.

In Ukraine, the <a href="Radical%20Party%20of%20Oleh%20Lyashko">Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko</a> has promised to purify the country of <a href="Ukrainian%20oligarchs">oligarchs</a> "with a <a href="pitchfork">pitchfork</a>". The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village
), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.

Historian F.K. Crowley finds that:

The <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National Party of Australia</a> (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called "<a href="countrymindedness">countrymindedness</a>". The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.

The <a href="New%20Zealand%20Liberal%20Party">New Zealand Liberal Party</a> aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891–1912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called "<a href="populism">populism</a>." <a href="Richard%20Seddon">Richard Seddon</a> had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: "It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand." The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The <a href="Liberal%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">Liberal government</a> also established the basis of the later welfare state such as <a href="old%20age%20pensions">old age pensions</a> and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it <a href="women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20New%20Zealand">extended voting rights to women</a>, making New Zealand the first country in the world to <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">do so</a>.

To obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased of Maori land. The government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.

Agrarianism is similar to but not identical with the <a href="back-to-the-land%20movement">back-to-the-land movement</a>. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the "progressive" character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not <a href="industrial%20farming">industrial farming</a>, with its specialization on products and industrial scale.

Angle

In <a href="planar%20geometry">planar geometry</a>, an angle is the figure formed by two <a href="Ray%20%28geometry%29">rays</a>, called the "sides" of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the "<a href="vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertex</a>" of the angle.
Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane, but this plane does not have to be a <a href="Euclidean%20plane">Euclidean plane</a>. Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean and other spaces</a>. These are called <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a>s. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the <a href="spherical%20angle">spherical angle</a> formed by two <a href="great%20circle">great circle</a>s on a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.

"Angle" is also used to designate the <a href="measure%20%28mathematics%29">measure</a> of an angle or of a <a href="Rotation%20%28mathematics%29">rotation</a>. This measure is the ratio of the length of a <a href="arc%20%28geometry%29">circular arc</a> to its <a href="radius">radius</a>. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.

The word "angle" comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "angulus", meaning "corner"; <a href="cognate">cognate</a> words are the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "(ankylοs)", meaning "crooked, curved," and the <a href="English%20language">English</a> word "<a href="ankle">ankle</a>". Both are connected with the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> root "*ank-", meaning "to bend" or "bow".
<a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a> an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by <a href="Eudemus%20of%20Rhodes">Eudemus</a>, who regarded an angle as a deviation from a <a href="straight%20line">straight line</a>; the second by <a href="Carpus%20of%20Antioch">Carpus of Antioch</a>, who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.

In mathematical expressions, it is common to use <a href="Greek%20letter">Greek letter</a>s (α, β, γ, θ, φ, . . . ) to serve as <a href="Variable%20%28mathematics%29">variables</a> standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol <a href="Pi"></a> is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case Roman letters ("a", "b", "c", . . . ) are also used, as are upper case Roman letters in the context of <a href="polygon">polygon</a>s. See the figures in this article for examples.

In geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted ∠BAC (in Unicode ) or formula_1. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex ("angle A").

Potentially, an angle denoted, say, ∠BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see <a href="%23Positive%20and%20negative%20angles">Positive and negative angles</a>). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that ∠BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and ∠CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.


The names, intervals, and measured units are shown in a table below:


When two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.


A <a href="Transversal%20%28geometry%29">transversal</a> is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with "alternate interior angles", "corresponding angles", "interior angles", and "exterior angles".

There are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:






The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be "equal" or "congruent" or "equal in measure".

In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the "orientation" of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full <a href="Turn%20%28geometry%29">turn</a> are effectively equivalent. In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a <a href="spiral">spiral</a> curve or describing the "cumulative rotation" of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.

In order to measure an angle <a href="theta">θ</a>, a <a href="circular%20arc">circular arc</a> centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of <a href="Compasses%20%28drafting%29">compasses</a>. The ratio of the length s of the arc by the radius r of the circle is the measure of the angle in <a href="radian">radian</a>s.

The measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor , where "k" is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for <a href="degree%20%28angle%29">degrees</a> or 400 for <a href="gradian">gradian</a>s):

The value of θ thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio "s"/"r" is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as One turn, for which units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's <a href="circumference">circumference</a>, which is 2"r", so . Substituting "n" for "θ" and 2"r" for "s" in the formula, results in ) 

The angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then

The measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.
In this postulate it does not matter in which <a href="Units%20of%20measurement">unit</a> the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.

Units used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the "<a href="degree%20%28angle%29">degree</a>" and the "<a href="radian">radian</a>" are by far the most commonly used. Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of <a href="dimensional%20analysis">dimensional analysis</a>.

Most units of angular measurement are defined such that one "<a href="Turn%20%28geometry%29">turn</a>" (i.e. one full circle) is equal to "n" units, for some whole number "n". The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.
















Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent <a href="Orientation%20%28geometry%29">orientations</a> and/or <a href="Rotation%20%28mathematics%29">rotations</a> in opposite directions relative to some reference.

In a two-dimensional <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The "initial side" is on the positive <a href="x-axis">x-axis</a>, while the other side or "terminal side" is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With "positive angles" representing rotations toward the positive <a href="y-axis">y-axis</a> and "negative angles" representing rotations toward the negative y-axis. When Cartesian coordinates are represented by "standard position", defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are <a href="anticlockwise">anticlockwise</a> and negative rotations are <a href="clockwise">clockwise</a>.

In many contexts, an angle of −"θ" is effectively equivalent to an angle of "one full turn minus "θ"". For example, an orientation represented as  −45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360° − 45° or 315°. Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of  −45° is not the same as a rotation of 315° (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).

In three-dimensional geometry, "clockwise" and "anticlockwise" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a <a href="Vector%20%28geometric%29">vector</a> passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In <a href="navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="bearing%20%28navigation%29">bearings</a> are measured relative to north. By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.

There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.
The "<a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade of a slope</a>", or "gradient" is equal to the <a href="tangent%20%28trigonometric%20function%29">tangent</a> of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the <a href="sine">sine</a>. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.

In <a href="rational%20geometry">rational geometry</a> the "<a href="spread%20%28rational%20trigonometry%29">spread</a>" between two lines is defined at the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.

Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.

These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough <a href="rule%20of%20thumb">rule of thumb</a> approximations only.

The angle between a line and a <a href="curve">curve</a> (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the <a href="tangent">tangent</a>s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:—"amphicyrtic" (Gr. , on both sides, κυρτός, convex) or "cissoidal" (Gr. κισσός, ivy), biconvex; "xystroidal" or "sistroidal" (Gr. ξυστρίς, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; "amphicoelic" (Gr. κοίλη, a hollow) or "angulus lunularis", biconcave.

The <a href="Greek%20mathematics">ancient Greek mathematicians</a> knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a <a href="compass%20and%20straightedge">compass and straightedge</a>, but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 <a href="Pierre%20Wantzel">Pierre Wantzel</a> showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.

In the <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a>, the angle "θ" between two <a href="Euclidean%20vector">Euclidean vector</a>s u and v is related to their <a href="dot%20product">dot product</a> and their lengths by the formula

This formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their <a href="normal%20vector">normal vector</a>s and between <a href="skew%20lines">skew lines</a> from their vector equations.

To define angles in an abstract real <a href="inner%20product%20space">inner product space</a>, we replace the Euclidean dot product ( · ) by the inner product formula_7, i.e.

In a complex <a href="inner%20product%20space">inner product space</a>, the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with

or, more commonly, using the absolute value, with

The latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces formula_11 and formula_12 spanned by the vectors formula_13 and formula_14 correspondingly.

The definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces formula_11 and formula_12 given by

in a <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces formula_18, formula_19 with formula_20, this leads to a definition of formula_21 angles called canonical or <a href="principal%20angles">principal angles</a> between subspaces.

In <a href="Riemannian%20geometry">Riemannian geometry</a>, the <a href="metric%20tensor">metric tensor</a> is used to define the angle between two <a href="tangent">tangent</a>s. Where "U" and "V" are tangent vectors and "g" are the components of the metric tensor "G",

A <a href="hyperbolic%20angle">hyperbolic angle</a> is an <a href="argument%20of%20a%20function">argument</a> of a <a href="hyperbolic%20function">hyperbolic function</a> just as the circular angle is the argument of a <a href="circular%20function">circular function</a>. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a <a href="hyperbolic%20sector">hyperbolic sector</a> and a <a href="circular%20sector">circular sector</a> since the <a href="area">area</a>s of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a> in their angle argument, the circular ones are just <a href="alternating%20series">alternating series</a> forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> in "<a href="Introduction%20to%20the%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Infinite">Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite</a>".

In <a href="geography">geography</a>, the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a "<a href="geographic%20coordinate%20system">geographic coordinate system</a>". This system specifies the <a href="latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="longitude">longitude</a> of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the <a href="equator">equator</a> and (usually) the <a href="Greenwich%20meridian">Greenwich meridian</a> as references.

In <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, a given point on the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a> (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several "<a href="astronomical%20coordinate%20systems">astronomical coordinate systems</a>", where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the "<a href="angular%20separation">angular separation</a>" of two <a href="star">star</a>s by imagining two lines through the centre of the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.

In both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a <a href="vertical%20angle">vertical angle</a> such as <a href="altitude%20angle">altitude</a> /<a href="elevation%20angle">elevation</a> with respect to the <a href="horizon">horizon</a> as well as the <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a> with respect to <a href="north">north</a>.

Astronomers also measure the "apparent size" of objects as an <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a>. For example, the <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a> has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5°, when viewed from Earth. One could say, "The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree." The <a href="small-angle%20formula">small-angle formula</a> can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.

The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and <a href="noise%20control">noise control</a> industries.

<a href="Hearing%20%28sense%29">Hearing</a> is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and <a href="speech">speech</a> is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. <a href="Robert%20Bruce%20Lindsay">Robert Bruce Lindsay</a>'s 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.

The word "acoustic" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word ἀκουστικός ("akoustikos"), meaning "of or for hearing, ready to hear" and that from ἀκουστός ("akoustos"), "heard, audible", which in turn derives from the verb ("akouo"), "I hear".

The Latin synonym is "sonic", after which the term sonics used to be a synonym for acoustics and later a branch of acoustics. <a href="Frequency">Frequencies</a> above and below the <a href="Audio%20frequency">audible range</a> are called "<a href="Ultrasound">ultrasonic</a>" and "<a href="infrasonic">infrasonic</a>", respectively.

In the 6th century BC, the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> philosopher <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> wanted to know why some <a href="Interval%20%28music%29">combinations of musical sounds</a> seemed more beautiful than others, and he found answers in terms of numerical ratios representing the <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> <a href="overtone%20series">overtone series</a> on a string. He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g. 2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds. If, for example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal). In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower. In one system of <a href="musical%20tuning">musical tuning</a>, the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384-322 BC) understood that sound consisted of compressions and rarefactions of air which "falls upon and strikes the air which is next to it...", a very good expression of the nature of <a href="wave">wave</a> motion.

In about 20 BC, the Roman architect and engineer <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> wrote a treatise on the acoustic properties of theaters including discussion of interference, echoes, and reverberation—the beginnings of <a href="architectural%20acoustics">architectural acoustics</a>. In pageRank.Book V of his "<a href="De%20architectura">De architectura</a>" ("The Ten Books of Architecture") Vitruvius describes sound as a wave comparable to a water wave extended to three dimensions, which, when interrupted by obstructions, would flow back and break up following waves. He described the ascending seats in ancient theaters as designed to prevent this deterioration of sound and also recommended bronze vessels of appropriate sizes be placed in theaters to resonate with the fourth, fifth and so on, up to the double octave, in order to resonate with the more desirable, harmonious notes.

The physical understanding of acoustical processes advanced rapidly during and after the <a href="Scientific%20Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a>. Mainly <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> (1564–1642) but also <a href="Marin%20Mersenne">Marin Mersenne</a> (1588–1648), independently, discovered the complete <a href="Mersenne%27s%20laws">laws of vibrating strings</a> (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier). Galileo wrote "Waves are produced by the <a href="vibration">vibration</a>s of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the <a href="ear">ear</a> a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound", a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics. Experimental measurements of the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne. Meanwhile, Newton (1642–1727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of <a href="physical%20acoustics">physical acoustics</a> (<a href="Philosophi%C3%A6%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">Principia</a>, 1687).

The eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation. In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were <a href="Helmholtz">Helmholtz</a> in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and <a href="John%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work "The Theory of Sound" (1877). Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.

The twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was <a href="Wallace%20Clement%20Sabine">Sabine</a>’s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War. <a href="Sound%20recording">Sound recording</a> and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society. Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing. The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry. New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.

Acoustics is defined by <a href="ANSI/ASA%20S1.1-2013">ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013</a> as "(a) Science of <a href="sound">sound</a>, including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects. (b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects."

The study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.

The steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process. There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional. There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave. There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the <a href="acoustic%20wave%20equation">acoustic wave equation</a>, but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex. The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium. Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived. The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains. The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>, a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.

The central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation. This falls within the domain of physical acoustics. In <a href="fluid">fluid</a>s, sound propagates primarily as a <a href="pressure%20wave">pressure wave</a>. In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including <a href="longitudinal%20waves">longitudinal waves</a>, <a href="transverse%20waves">transverse waves</a> and <a href="surface%20waves">surface waves</a>.

Acoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment. This interaction can be described as either a <a href="diffraction">diffraction</a>, <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> or a <a href="Reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a> or a mix of the three. If several <a href="Transmission%20medium">media</a> are present, a <a href="refraction">refraction</a> can also occur. Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics.

In fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level. While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear. The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the <a href="Absolute%20threshold%20of%20hearing">threshold of hearing</a>, is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure. The <a href="loudness">loudness</a> of these disturbances is related to the <a href="sound%20pressure%20level">sound pressure level</a> (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.

Physicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our <a href="ears">ears</a> interpret sound. What we experience as "higher pitched" or "lower pitched" sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second. In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots. Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.

The entire spectrum can be divided into three sections: audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic. The audio range falls between 20 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a> and 20,000 Hz. This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear. This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music. The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000 Hz and higher. This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies. Medical applications such as <a href="Medical%20ultrasonography">ultrasonography</a> and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range. On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range. These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.

Analytic instruments such as the <a href="spectrum%20analyzer">spectrum analyzer</a> facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties. The <a href="spectrogram">spectrogram</a> produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.

A <a href="transducer">transducer</a> is a device for converting one form of energy into another. In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). Electroacoustic transducers include <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a>s, <a href="microphone">microphone</a>s, <a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a>s and <a href="sonar">sonar</a> projectors. These devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal. The most widely used transduction principles are <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a>, <a href="electrostatics">electrostatics</a> and <a href="piezoelectricity">piezoelectricity</a>.

The transducers in most common <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a>s (e.g. <a href="woofer">woofer</a>s and <a href="tweeter">tweeter</a>s), are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic <a href="voice%20coil">voice coil</a>, sending off pressure waves. <a href="Electret%20microphone">Electret microphone</a>s and <a href="condenser%20microphone">condenser microphone</a>s employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.

An acoustician is an expert in the science of sound.

There are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">Bachelor's degree</a> or higher qualification. Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as <a href="physics">physics</a> or <a href="engineering">engineering</a>. Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in <a href="Mathematics">Mathematics</a> and <a href="science">science</a>. Many acoustic scientists work in research and development. Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g. <a href="hearing">hearing</a>, <a href="psychoacoustics">psychoacoustics</a> or <a href="neurophysiology">neurophysiology</a>) of <a href="speech">speech</a>, <a href="music">music</a> and <a href="noise">noise</a>. Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g. <a href="Underwater%20acoustics">Underwater acoustics</a>, <a href="Architectural%20acoustics">Architectural acoustics</a> or <a href="Structural%20acoustics">Structural acoustics</a>. Others areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below. Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories.

Atomic physics

Atomic physics is the field of <a href="physics">physics</a> that studies <a href="atom">atom</a>s as an isolated system of <a href="electron">electron</a>s and an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. It is primarily concerned with the <a href="Electron%20configuration">arrangement of electrons around the nucleus</a> and
the processes by which these arrangements change. This comprises <a href="ion">ion</a>s, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term "atom" includes ions.

The term "atomic physics" can be associated with <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> and <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s, due to the <a href="synonym">synonym</a>ous use of "atomic" and "nuclear" in <a href="standard%20English">standard English</a>. Physicists distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, which considers <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nuclei</a> alone.

As with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of "<a href="atomic%2C%20molecular%2C%20and%20optical%20physics">atomic, molecular, and optical physics</a>". Physics research groups are usually so classified.

Atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is not concerned with the formation of <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s (although much of the physics is identical), nor does it examine atoms in a <a href="solid%20state%20physics">solid state</a> as <a href="condensed%20matter">condensed matter</a>. It is concerned with processes such as <a href="ionization">ionization</a> and <a href="excited%20state">excitation</a> by photons or collisions with atomic particles.

While modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a <a href="gas">gas</a> or <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation, as the vast majority of the time they are. By this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma physics</a> and <a href="atmospheric%20physics">atmospheric physics</a>, even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms.

Electrons form notional <a href="Electron%20shells">shells</a> around the nucleus. These are normally in a <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a> but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light (<a href="photon">photon</a>s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically ions or other electrons).

If the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will be transferred to an <a href="excited%20state">excited state</a>. After a certain time, the electron in an excited state will "jump" (undergo a transition) to a lower state. In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy, since energy is conserved.

If an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy (so that the atom ionizes), then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital. In this case, a visible photon or a <a href="characteristic%20x-ray">characteristic x-ray</a> is emitted, or a phenomenon known as the <a href="Auger%20effect">Auger effect</a> may take place, where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron, causing it to go into the continuum. The Auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.

There are rather strict <a href="selection%20rule">selection rule</a>s as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light — however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.

The majority of fields in physics can be divided between theoretical work and experimental work,
and atomic physics is no exception. It is usually the case, but not always, that progress goes
in alternate cycles from an experimental observation, through to a theoretical explanation
followed by some predictions that may or may not be confirmed by experiment, and so on. Of course, the current state of technology at any given time can put limitations on what can be achieved experimentally and theoretically so it may take considerable time for theory to be refined.

One of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed
of "atoms". It forms a part of the texts written in 6th century BC to 2nd century BC such as those of <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> or <a href="Vaisheshika%20Sutra">Vaisheshika Sutra</a> written by <a href="Kanad">Kanad</a>. This theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> by the British chemist and physicist <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a> in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties (in bulk). The invention of the <a href="periodic%20system%20of%20elements">periodic system of elements</a> by <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Mendeleev</a> was another great step forward.

The true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s and attempts to describe the phenomenon, most notably by <a href="Joseph%20von%20Fraunhofer">Joseph von Fraunhofer</a>. The study of these lines led to the <a href="Bohr%20atom%20model">Bohr atom model</a> and to the birth of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. In seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed. As far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned, not only did this yield a better overall description, i.e. the <a href="atomic%20orbital%20model">atomic orbital model</a>, but it also provided a new theoretical basis for <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>
(<a href="quantum%20chemistry">quantum chemistry</a>) and <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>.

Since the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace. This can be attributed to progress in computing technology, which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes. Similar technological advances in accelerators, detectors, magnetic field generation and <a href="laser">laser</a>s have greatly assisted experimental work.

American Sign Language

American Sign Language (ASL) is a <a href="natural%20language">natural language</a> that serves as the predominant <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a> of <a href="Deaf%20community">Deaf communities</a> in the United States and most of <a href="Anglophone%20Canadians">Anglophone Canada</a>. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based <a href="creole%20language">creoles</a> are used in many countries around the world, including much of <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> and parts of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. ASL is also widely learned as a <a href="second%20language">second language</a>, serving as a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>. ASL is most closely related to <a href="French%20Sign%20Language">French Sign Language</a> (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a <a href="creole%20language">creole language</a> of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as <a href="agglutination">agglutinative morphology</a>.

ASL originated in the early 19th century in the <a href="American%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">American School for the Deaf</a> (ASD) in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, from a situation of <a href="language%20contact">language contact</a>. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of <a href="child%20of%20deaf%20adult">children of deaf adults</a>. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of <a href="oral%20language">oral language</a> to sign language, compounded by the fact that ASL is often <a href="interlinear%20gloss">glossed</a> in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.

ASL signs have a number of <a href="phoneme">phonemic</a> components, including movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of <a href="mime">pantomime</a>, but <a href="iconicity">iconicity</a> does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English <a href="loan%20word">loan word</a>s are often borrowed through <a href="fingerspelling">fingerspelling</a>, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal <a href="agreement%20%28linguistics%29">agreement</a> and <a href="grammatical%20aspect">aspectual</a> marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative <a href="classifier%20%28linguistics%29">classifiers</a>. Many linguists believe ASL to be a <a href="subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a> (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.

ASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in 1817. This school brought together <a href="Old%20French%20Sign%20Language">Old French Sign Language</a>, various <a href="village%20sign%20language">village sign language</a>s, and <a href="home%20sign">home sign</a> systems; ASL was created in this situation of <a href="language%20contact">language contact</a>. ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.

The influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are <a href="cognate">cognate</a> to <a href="Old%20French%20Sign%20Language">Old French Sign Language</a> signs. However, this is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s. This suggests that nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students, despite the fact that the school's original director <a href="Laurent%20Clerc">Laurent Clerc</a> taught in LSF. In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students' signs rather than conveying LSF:
It has been proposed that ASL is a <a href="creole%20language">creole</a> with LSF as the <a href="superstrate">superstrate</a> language and with the native village sign languages as <a href="substrate%20%28linguistics%29">substrate</a> languages. However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages. ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards <a href="agglutination">agglutination</a>, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards <a href="isolating%20morphology">isolating morphology</a>. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of <a href="manually%20coded%20language">manually coded language</a> in instruction rather than true LSF.

Although the United States, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and <a href="Australia">Australia</a> share <a href="English%20language">English</a> as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with <a href="British%20Sign%20Language">British Sign Language</a> (BSL) or <a href="Auslan">Auslan</a>. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same <a href="language%20family">language family</a>. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of <a href="iconicity">iconicity</a> in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.

American Sign Language is growing in popularity among many states. Many people in high school and colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.

Prior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc <a href="home%20sign">home sign</a>, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by <a href="Francisco%20V%C3%A1squez%20de%20Coronado">Francisco Vásquez de Coronado</a>, there were reports that the <a href="Plains%20Indians">Plains Indians</a> had developed <a href="Plains%20Indian%20Sign%20Language">a sign language</a> to communicate between tribes of different languages.

In the 19th century, a "triangle" of <a href="village%20sign%20language">village sign language</a>s developed in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>: one in <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard</a>, Massachusetts; one in <a href="Henniker%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Henniker, New Hampshire</a>, and one in <a href="Sandy%20River%20Valley%2C%20Maine">Sandy River Valley, Maine</a>. <a href="Martha%27s%20Vineyard%20Sign%20Language">Martha's Vineyard Sign Language</a> (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in <a href="Chilmark%2C%20Massachusetts">Chilmark, Massachusetts</a>. Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness. MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present.

ASL is thought to have originated in the <a href="American%20School%20for%20the%20Deaf">American School for the Deaf</a> (ASD), founded in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a> in 1817. Originally known as "The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb", the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student <a href="Thomas%20Hopkins%20Gallaudet">Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet</a>. Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl <a href="Alice%20Cogswell">Alice Cogswell</a>, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French <a href="Institut%20National%20de%20Jeunes%20Sourds%20de%20Paris">Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris</a>, and convinced <a href="Laurent%20Clerc">Laurent Clerc</a>, an assistant to the school's founder <a href="Charles-Michel%20de%20l%27%C3%89p%C3%A9e">Charles-Michel de l'Épée</a>, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.

The largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them. There were also 44 students from around <a href="Henniker%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Henniker, New Hampshire</a>, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language. Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. <a href="Laurent%20Clerc">Laurent Clerc</a>, the first teacher at ASD, taught using <a href="French%20Sign%20Language">French Sign Language</a> (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of <a href="language%20contact">language contact</a>, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.
More schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20the%20Deaf%20%28United%20States%29">National Association of the Deaf</a> and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.

Up to the 1950s, the predominant method in deaf education was <a href="oralism">oralism</a> – acquiring oral language comprehension and production. Linguists did not consider sign language to be true "language", but rather something inferior. Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by <a href="William%20Stokoe">William Stokoe</a>, a linguist who arrived at <a href="Gallaudet%20University">Gallaudet University</a> in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption. Aided by the civil rights movement of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for <a href="manualism">manualism</a>, the use of sign language in deaf education. Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a <a href="Transcription%20%28linguistics%29">transcription</a> system for ASL. In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics. In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as "Ameslan", but this term is now considered obsolete.

Counting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census. The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974). Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000. The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact, the name "ASL" was not yet in widespread use.

Incorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of this figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of <a href="prelingual%20deafness">prelingual deafness</a>, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.

ASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population "requiring an interpreter in court". Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among <a href="monolingual">monolingual</a>s other than English, it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.

ASL is used throughout <a href="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a>. This contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent. The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.

Throughout <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, ASL-based sign languages are spoken by educated Deaf adults. These languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries, and are named accordingly, e.g. <a href="Nigerian%20Sign%20Language">Nigerian Sign Language</a>, <a href="Ghanaian%20Sign%20Language">Ghanaian Sign Language</a>. Such signing systems are found in <a href="Benin">Benin</a>, <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, and <a href="Togo">Togo</a>. Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar these sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.

In addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a <a href="first%20language">first language</a> in <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, <a href="China">China</a> (<a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>), the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. ASL is also used as a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> throughout the deaf world, widely learned as a <a href="second%20language">second language</a>.

Varieties of ASL are found throughout the world. There is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the United States and Canada.

<a href="Mutual%20intelligibility">Mutual intelligibility</a> among these ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily <a href="Vocabulary">lexical</a>. For example, there are three different words for English "about" in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), as shown in the videos on the right. Variation may also be <a href="phonological">phonological</a>, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.

There is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community. <a href="Black%20ASL">Black ASL</a> evolved as a result of <a href="racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Education">racially segregated schools</a> in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf. Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure. While <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a> (AAVE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs. Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space. Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAVE; for instance, the AAVE idiom "I feel you" is <a href="calque">calque</a>d into Black ASL.

ASL is used internationally as a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>, and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries. Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in these imported ASL varieties. <a href="Bolivian%20Sign%20Language">Bolivian Sign Language</a> is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects. On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, <a href="Malaysian%20Sign%20Language">Malaysian Sign Language</a>, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language. For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.

When communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called <a href="Pidgin%20Signed%20English">Pidgin Signed English</a> (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL. Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically <a href="relexification">relexified</a> English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar. Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL. There have been some <a href="constructed%20languages">constructed sign languages</a>, known as <a href="Manually%20Coded%20English">Manually Coded English</a> (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; these systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.

<a href="Tactile%20ASL">Tactile ASL</a> (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the <a href="deaf-blind">deaf-blind</a>. It is particularly common among those with <a href="Usher%27s%20syndrome">Usher's syndrome</a>. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.

In 2013 the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to "officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools". The response is titled "there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language" and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively. Scholars such as <a href="Beth%20S.%20Benedict">Beth S. Benedict</a> advocate not only for <a href="bilingualism">bilingualism</a> (using ASL and English training) but also for <a href="early%20childhood%20intervention">early childhood intervention</a> for children who are deaf. York University psychologist <a href="Ellen%20Bialystok">Ellen Bialystok</a> has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.

The majority of children born to deaf parents are hearing. These children, known as <a href="Child%20of%20deaf%20adult">CODAs</a> ("Children Of Deaf Adults") are often more <a href="Deaf%20culture">culturally Deaf</a> than deaf children, the majority of whom are born to hearing parents. Unlike many deaf children, CODAs acquire ASL as well as Deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth. These <a href="bilingual">bilingual</a> hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being "slow learners" or as having "language difficulties" due to preferential attitudes towards spoken language.

Although there is no well-established writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of <a href="Roch-Ambroise%20Auguste%20B%C3%A9bian">Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian</a>, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created <a href="Stokoe%20notation">Stokoe notation</a> specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a> for every <a href="phonemic">phonemic</a> (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 "A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles".

<a href="SignWriting">SignWriting</a>, proposed in 1974 by <a href="Valerie%20Sutton">Valerie Sutton</a>, is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the <a href="Unicode">Unicode Standard</a>. SignWriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs/glyphs. Currently, it is in use in many schools for the Deaf, particularly in Brazil, and has been used in international sign language forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Tunisia, and the United States. Sutton SignWriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written (personal letters, newspapers, and media, academic research). The systematic examination of the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA) as an equivalent usage structure to the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> for spoken languages has been proposed. According to some researchers, SignWriting is not a <a href="phonemic%20orthography">phonemic orthography</a> and does not have a one-to-one map from phonological forms to written forms. This assertion has been disputed and the process for each country to look at the ISWA and create a phonemic/morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers Msc. Roberto Cesar Reis da Costa and Madson Barreto in a thesis forum on June 23, 2014. The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on <a href="Wikimedia%20Incubator">Wikimedia Incubator</a> and elsewhere involving SignWriting. The ASL Wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008 and the test ASL Wikipedia has 50 articles written in ASL using SignWriting.

The most widely used <a href="transcription%20%28linguistics%29">transcription</a> system among academics is <a href="HamNoSys">HamNoSys</a>, developed at the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a>. Based on Stokoe Notation, HamNoSys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language. Phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols, though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol.

Several additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including <a href="SignFont">SignFont</a>, <a href="ASL-phabet">ASL-phabet</a>, and <a href="Si5s">Si5s</a>.

For English-speaking audiences, ASL is often <a href="interlinear%20gloss">glossed</a> using English words. These glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence DOG NOW CHASE>IX=3 CAT, meaning "the dog is chasing the cat", uses NOW to mark ASL <a href="progressive%20aspect">progressive aspect</a> and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (written with >IX=3). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.

Each sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components. A sign may use one hand or both. Each hand assumes a <a href="handshape">handshape</a> with a particular <a href="orientation%20%28sign%20language%29">orientation</a> in a particular <a href="location%20%28sign%20language%29">location</a> on the body or in the "signing space", and may involve <a href="movement%20%28sign%20language%29">movement</a>. Changing any one of these may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED:
There are also meaningful <a href="expression%20%28sign%20language%29">non-manual signals</a> in ASL. This may include movement of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.

<a href="William%20Stokoe">William Stokoe</a> proposed that these components are analogous to the <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s of spoken languages. There has also been a proposal that these are analogous to classes like <a href="place%20of%20articulation">place</a> and <a href="manner%20of%20articulation">manner of articulation</a>. As in spoken languages, these phonological units can be split into <a href="distinctive%20feature">distinctive feature</a>s. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature [± closed thumb], as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of <a href="allophony">allophony</a> and <a href="phonotactic">phonotactic</a> restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of <a href="syllable">syllable</a>s in spoken language.

ASL has a rich system of verbal <a href="inflection">inflection</a>. This involves both <a href="grammatical%20aspect">grammatical aspect</a>—how the action of verbs flows in time—and <a href="agreement%20%28linguistics%29">agreement</a> marking. Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, <a href="continuous%20aspect">continuous aspect</a> is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position. Verbs may agree with both the <a href="grammatical%20subject">subject</a> and the <a href="grammatical%20object">object</a>, and are marked for <a href="grammatical%20number">number</a> and reciprocity. Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT, articulated by having two L-shaped hands "shooting" at each other.

ASL has a productive system of <a href="classifier%20%28linguistics%29">classifiers</a>, which are used to classify objects and their movement in space. For example, a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent V classifier handshape with a downhill-directed path; if the rabbit is hopping, the path is executed with a bouncy manner. In general, classifiers are composed of a "classifier handshape" <a href="bound%20morpheme">bound</a> to a "movement root". The classifier handshape represents the object as a whole, incorporating such attributes as surface, depth, and shape, and is usually very iconic. The movement root consists of a path, a direction and a manner.

ASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the <a href="American%20manual%20alphabet">American manual alphabet</a>, which can be used to spell out words from the English language. These signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (<a href="Rochester%20Method">Rochester Method</a>) has been used, it is not ASL.

Fingerspelling is a form of <a href="borrowing%20%28linguistics%29">borrowing</a>, a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for <a href="proper%20nouns">proper nouns</a> and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. "O-N" from English 'on', and "A-P-T" from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.

The basic word order of ASL is disputed. Most linguists agree that ASL is a <a href="subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a> (SVO) language with various phenomena affecting this basic word order. Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:

However, other word orders may also occur, as ASL allows the <a href="topic%20%28linguistics%29">topic</a> of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as <a href="topicalization">topicalization</a>. In <a href="object-subject-verb">object-subject-verb</a> (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:
Even more, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy. In subject copy, the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding, either for clarification or emphasis:

ASL also allows <a href="null%20subject">null subject</a> sentences, where the subject is implied rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, in which the subject is omitted from its original position, yielding a <a href="verb%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93subject">verb–object–subject</a> (VOS) construction:

Topicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, <a href="object%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93subject">object–verb–subject</a> (OVS).

These properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, "basic" order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a <a href="topic%E2%80%93comment">topic–comment</a> structure, where words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties. Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits <a href="free%20word%20order">free word order</a>, in which syntax is not encoded in word order whatsoever, but can be encoded by other means (e.g. head nods, eyebrow movement, body position).

A common misconception is that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL <a href="iconicity">iconicity</a> plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This may be due to the fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.

In the era of the influential linguist <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a>, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a> is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.

Research on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning. It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun "you", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name. This is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly iconic signs.

Applet

In <a href="computing">computing</a>, an applet is any small <a href="application%20%28computing%29">application</a> that performs one specific task that runs within the scope of a dedicated <a href="widget%20engine">widget engine</a> or a larger <a href="program%20%28computing%29">program</a>, often as a <a href="plug-in%20%28computing%29">plug-in</a>. The term is frequently used to refer to a <a href="Java%20applet">Java applet</a>, a program written in the <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> programming language that is designed to be placed on a <a href="web%20page">web page</a>. Applets are typical examples of <a href="Application%20posture">transient and auxiliary applications</a> that don't monopolize the user's attention. Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible.

The word "applet" was first used in 1990 in PC Magazine. However, the concept of an applet, or more broadly a small interpreted program downloaded and executed by the user, dates at least to RFC 5 (1969) by <a href="Jeff%20Rulifson">Jeff Rulifson</a>, which described the <a href="Decode-Encode%20Language">Decode-Encode Language</a> (DEL), which was designed to allow remote use of the <a href="NLS%20%28computer%20system%29">oN-Line System</a> (NLS) over <a href="ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, by downloading small programs to enhance the interaction. This has been specifically credited as a forerunner of Java's downloadable programs in RFC 2555.

In some cases, an applet does not run independently. These applets must run either in a <a href="Container%20%28data%20structure%29">container</a> provided by a host program, through a <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plugin</a>, or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.

Applets are used to provide interactive features to web applications that cannot be provided by <a href="HTML">HTML</a> alone. They can capture <a href="Mouse%20%28computing%29">mouse input</a> and also have controls like <a href="Button%20%28computing%29">buttons</a> or <a href="check%20box">check box</a>es. In response to the user action an applet can change the provided graphic content. This makes applets well suitable for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. There are online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics to heart physiology. Applets are also used to create online game collections that allow players to compete against live opponents in real-time.

An applet can also be a text area only, providing, for instance, a cross platform <a href="command-line%20interface">command-line interface</a> to some remote system. If needed, an applet can leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. However, applets have very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area, so they are less useful for improving the site appearance in general (while applets like <a href="news%20ticker">news ticker</a>s or <a href="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editors are also known). Applets can also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser

HTML pages may embed parameters that are passed to the applet. Hence the same applet may appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed.

Examples of Web-based Applets include:


A larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:


A Java Applet is a java program that is launched from HTML and run in a web browser. It can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by <a href="HTML">HTML</a>. Since Java's <a href="bytecode">bytecode</a> is platform-independent, Java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms, including <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a>. When a Java technology-enabled <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a> processes a page that contains an applet, the applet's <a href="code">code</a> is transferred to the client's system and executed by the browser's <a href="Java%20Virtual%20Machine">Java Virtual Machine</a> (JVM). An HTML page references an applet either via the <a href="Deprecation">deprecated</a> <a href="HTML%20element%23applet"><applet> tag</a> or via its replacement, the <a href="HTML%20element%23object"><object> tag</a>.

Recent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and <a href="embedded%20system">embedded system</a>s have led to the awareness of the security of applets.

Applets in an <a href="open%20platform">open platform</a> environment should provide secure interactions between different applications. A compositional approach can be used to provide security for <a href="open%20platform">open platform</a> applets. Advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions.

A <a href="Java%20applet">Java applet</a> contains different security models: <a href="Java%20applet%23Unsigned">unsigned Java applet security</a>, <a href="Java%20applet%23Signed">signed Java applet security</a>, and <a href="Java%20applet%23Self-signed">self signed Java applet security</a>.

In an applet-enabled <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a>, many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets. A malicious applet can infect a computer system in many ways, including denial of service, invasion of privacy, and annoyance. A typical solution for malicious applets is to make the web browser to monitor applets' activities. This will result in a web browser that will enable the manual or automatic stopping of malicious applets. To illustrate this method, AppletGuard was used to observe and control any applet in a browser successfully.

Alternate history

Alternate history or alternative history (British English), sometimes abbreviated as AH, is a <a href="genre">genre</a> of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently. These stories usually contain "what if" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on fact. Alternate history can be seen as a subgenre of <a href="literary%20fiction">literary fiction</a>, <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, or <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. Another term occasionally used for the genre is "allohistory" (literally "other history").

Since the 1950s, this type of fiction has, to a large extent, merged with science fiction <a href="trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a>s involving time travel between alternate histories, psychic awareness of the existence of one universe by the people in another, or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more <a href="timestream">timelines</a>. Cross-time, time-splitting, and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another.

In <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> and <a href="German%20language">German</a>, the genre of alternate history is sometimes called "uchronie / ucronia / ucronía / Uchronie", which has given rise to the term "<a href="Uchronia">Uchronia</a>" in English. This <a href="neologism">neologism</a> is based on the prefix (which in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> means "not/not any/no") and the Greek , meaning "time." A "uchronia" means literally "(in) no time." This term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list, "".

The <a href="Collins%20English%20Dictionary">Collins English Dictionary</a> defines alternative history as "a genre of fiction in which the author speculates on how the course of history might have been altered if a particular historical event had had a different outcome." According to <a href="Steven%20H%20Silver">Steven H Silver</a>, an American science fiction editor, alternate history requires three things: a <a href="point%20of%20divergence">point of divergence</a> from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing, a change that would alter history as it is known, and an examination of the ramifications of that change.

Several <a href="genre%20fiction">genres of fiction</a> have been misidentified as alternate history. Science fiction set in what was the future but is now the past, like <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "" or <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>", is not alternate history because the author did not make the choice to change the past at the time of writing. <a href="Secret%20history">Secret history</a>, which can take the form of fiction or nonfiction, documents events that may or may not have happened historically but did not have an effect on the overall outcome of history, and so is not to be confused with alternate history. 

Alternate history is related to, but distinct from, <a href="counterfactual%20history">counterfactual history</a>. This term is used by some professional historians to describe the practice of using thoroughly researched and carefully reasoned speculations on "what might have happened if..." as a tool of academic historical research, as opposed to a literary device.

The earliest example of alternate (or counterfactual) history is found in <a href="Livy">Livy</a>'s "<a href="Ab%20Urbe%20Condita%20Libri%20%28Livy%29">Ab Urbe Condita Libri</a>" (book IX, sections 17–19). Livy contemplated an alternative 4th century BC in which <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> had expanded his empire westward instead of eastward; he asked, "What would have been the results for <a href="Roman%20Empire">Rome</a> if she had been engaged in a war with Alexander?" Livy concluded that the Romans would likely have defeated Alexander.

Another example is <a href="Joanot%20Martorell">Joanot Martorell</a>'s 1490 <a href="epic%20poetry">epic</a> <a href="chivalric%20romance">romance</a> "<a href="Tirant%20lo%20Blanch">Tirant lo Blanch</a>", which was written when the loss of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turks</a> was still a recent and traumatic memory for <a href="Christianity%20in%20Europe">Christian Europe</a>. It tells the story of the knight Tirant the White from Brittany who travels to the embattled remnants of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. He becomes a <a href="Megas%20doux">Megaduke</a> and commander of its armies and manages to fight off the invading Ottoman armies of . He saves the city from <a href="Early%20Muslim%20conquests">Islamic conquest</a>, and even chases the Turks deeper into lands they had previously conquered.

Though "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Mormon">The pageRank.Book of Mormon</a>" (1830) is regarded by those in the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a> as a sacred text, <a href="Mitch%20Horowitz">Mitch Horowitz</a> has characterized the document as alternate history. "The pageRank.Book of Mormon" depicts a variation on a commonly-believed theme in early 19th-century America: the idea that the Americas had been settled by immigrants from the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> who had established an advanced culture that fell into decline and was thus vanished by the arrival of Europeans in the 1490s and later.

One of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a large audience may be <a href="Louis%20Geoffroy">Louis Geoffroy</a>'s "Histoire de la Monarchie universelle: Napoléon et la conquête du monde (1812–1832)" (History of the Universal Monarchy: Napoleon And The Conquest Of The World) (1836), which imagines <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> emerging victorious in the <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">French invasion of Russia</a> in 1811 and in an invasion of England in 1814, later unifying the world under Bonaparte's rule.

In the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>, the first known complete alternate history is <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s <a href="short%20story">short story</a> "<a href="P.%27s%20Correspondence">P.'s Correspondence</a>", published in 1845. It recounts the tale of a man who is considered "a madman" due to his perceptions of a different 1845, a reality in which long-dead famous people, such as the poets <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a>, <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> and <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>, the actor <a href="Edmund%20Kean">Edmund Kean</a>, the British politician <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a>, and even <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, are still alive.

The first novel-length alternate history in English would seem to be <a href="Castello%20Holford">Castello Holford</a>'s "<a href="Aristopia">Aristopia</a>" (1895). While not as nationalistic as <a href="Louis%20Geoffroy">Louis Geoffroy</a>'s "Napoléon et la conquête du monde, 1812–1823", "Aristopia" is another attempt to portray a Utopian society. In "Aristopia", the earliest settlers in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> discover a reef made of solid <a href="gold">gold</a> and are able to build a <a href="Utopia">Utopia</a>n society in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>.

A number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (see, for example, <a href="Charles%20Petrie%20%28historian%29">Charles Petrie's</a> "If: A Jacobite Fantasy" [1926]). In 1931, British historian <a href="Sir%20John%20Squire">Sir John Squire</a> collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period for his anthology "<a href="If%20It%20Had%20Happened%20Otherwise">If It Had Happened Otherwise</a>". In this work, scholars from major universities (as well as important non-university-based authors) turned their attention to such questions as "If the Moors in Spain Had Won" and "If <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> Had Had an Atom of Firmness". The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to <a href="Hendrik%20Willem%20van%20Loon">Hendrik Willem van Loon</a>'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Among the authors included were <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Maurois">André Maurois</a>, and <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>.
One of the entries in Squire's volume was Churchill's "If Lee Had Not the Battle of Gettysburg", written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> had won the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The entry considers what would have happened if the North had been victorious (in other words, a character from an alternate world imagines a world more like the real one we live in, although not identical in every detail). Speculative work that narrates from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as "<a href="recursive%20alternate%20history">recursive alternate history</a>", a "double-blind what-if", or an "alternate-alternate history". Churchill's essay was one of the influences behind <a href="Ward%20Moore">Ward Moore</a>'s alternate history novel "<a href="Bring%20the%20Jubilee">Bring the Jubilee</a>", in which General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, paving the way for the eventual victory of the Confederacy in the American Civil War (named the "War of Southron Independence" in this timeline). The protagonist, autodidact Hodgins Backmaker, travels back to the aforementioned battle and inadvertently changes history, resulting in the emergence of our own timeline and the consequent victory of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> instead.

American humorist author <a href="James%20Thurber">James Thurber</a> parodied alternate history stories about the American Civil War in his 1930 story "If Grant had been drinking at Appomattox", which he accompanied with this very brief introduction: ""Scribner's" magazine is publishing a series of three articles: 'If Booth Had Missed Lincoln', 'If Lee Had Won the Battle of Gettysburg', and 'If Napoleon Had Escaped to America'. This is the fourth.".

Another example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit <a href="Time%20travel%20in%20fiction">cross-time travel</a> from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) is <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' "<a href="Men%20Like%20Gods">Men Like Gods</a>" (1923), in which several Englishmen are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe featuring a seemingly pacifistic and utopian Britain. When the Englishmen, led by a satiric figure based on Winston Churchill, try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells describes a <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a> of alternative worlds, complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with U.S. pulp writers. However, since his hero experiences only a single alternate world, this story is not very different from conventional alternate history.

In the 1930s, alternate history moved into a new arena. The December 1933 issue of "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding</a>" published <a href="Nat%20Schachner">Nat Schachner</a>'s "Ancestral Voices", which was quickly followed by <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s "<a href="Sidewise%20in%20Time">Sidewise in Time</a>". While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his "World gone mad", pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows Professor Minott and his students from a fictitious Robinson College as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history.

A somewhat similar approach was taken by <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> in his 1941 novelette "<a href="Elsewhen">Elsewhen</a>", in which a professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines. He then hypnotizes his students so they can explore more of them. Eventually each settles into the reality most suitable for him or her. Some of the worlds they visit are mundane, some very odd; others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions.

<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> produced alternate history for <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>: both British and American authors wrote works depicting Nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales.

The period around World War II also saw the publication of the <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> novel "<a href="Lest%20Darkness%20Fall">Lest Darkness Fall</a>" by <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, in which an American academic travels to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> at the time of the Byzantine invasion of the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>. De Camp's time traveler, Martin Padway, is depicted as making permanent historical changes and implicitly forming a new time branch, thereby making the work an alternate history.

Time travel as the cause of a <a href="point%20of%20divergence">point of divergence</a> (POD), which can denote either the bifurcation of a historical timeline or a simple replacement of the future that existed before the time traveling event, has continued to be a popular theme. In Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee", the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the Confederacy has won the American Civil War; he travels backward through time, and brings about a Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg.

When a story's assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time's future rather than just the creation of an additional time line, the device of a "time patrol" is often used, most notably in <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s <a href="Poul%20Anderson%23Time%20Patrol">"Time Patrol"</a> collection—where guardians race uptime and downtime to preserve the "correct" history. In the most celebrated of this series, "<a href="Delenda%20Est">Delenda Est</a>", the interference of time traveling outlaws causes <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> to win the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> and destroy <a href="Rome">Rome</a> with massive consequences for the present day.

A more recent example is "<a href="Making%20History%20%28novel%29">Making History</a>" by <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>, in which a time machine is used to alter history so that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was never born. This ironically results in a more competent leader of the Third Reich, resulting in the country's ascendancy and longevity in this altered timeline.

H.G. Wells' "cross-time" or "many universes" variant (see above) was fully developed by Murray Leinster in his 1934 short story "Sidewise in Time", in which sections of the Earth's surface begin changing places with their counterparts in alternate timelines.

<a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a> employed this subgenre to satirize the science fiction pulps and their adolescent readers—and fears of foreign invasion—in the classic "<a href="What%20Mad%20Universe">What Mad Universe</a>" (1949). In <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a>'s "<a href="Ring%20Around%20the%20Sun%20%28novel%29">Ring Around the Sun</a>" (1953), the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed but a band of mutants is establishing a colony; the story line appears to frame the author's anxieties regarding <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> and the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

In the late 1940s and the 1950s, however, writers such as <a href="H.%20Beam%20Piper">H. Beam Piper</a>, <a href="Sam%20Merwin%2C%20Jr.">Sam Merwin, Jr.</a> and <a href="Andre%20Norton">Andre Norton</a> wrote thrillers set in a <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">multiverse</a> in which all alternate histories are co-existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and/or paratime capsules. These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and/or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>-style secret agents (Piper called them the "<a href="paratime%20series">paratime police</a>").

This concept provided a convenient framing for packing a smörgåsbord of historical alternatives (and even of timeline "branches") into a single novel, either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain(s) through multiple worlds or (less artfully) via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors (or between paratime agents and new recruits) regarding the histories of such worlds.

The paratime theme is sometimes used without the police; Poul Anderson dreamed up the Old Phoenix tavern as a nexus between alternate histories. A character from a modern American alternate history "Operation Chaos" can thus appear in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> setting of "A Midsummer's Tempest". In this context, the distinction between an alternate history and a parallel universe with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible, as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish.

Paratime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the <a href="many-worlds%20interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> (first formulated by <a href="Hugh%20Everett%20III">Hugh Everett III</a> in 1957) to account for the differing worlds. Some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision-making and free will, while others rely on the <a href="butterfly%20effect">butterfly effect</a> from <a href="chaos%20theory">chaos theory</a> to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a <a href="macroscopic">macroscopic</a> divergence at some specific point in history; either way, science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical point of divergence (often abbreviated 'POD' by fans of the genre). Prior to Everett, science-fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of <a href="P.%20D.%20Ouspensky">P. D. Ouspensky</a> to explain their characters' cross-time journeys.

While many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse, the "many world" theory would naturally involve many worlds, in fact a continually exploding array of universes. In quantum theory, new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event, and even if the writer uses human decisions, every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline. A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in "<a href="Night%20Watch%20%28Discworld%29">Night Watch</a>", <a href="Terry%20Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen, has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that "all" possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as <a href="Larry%20Niven">Larry Niven</a>'s story "<a href="All%20the%20Myriad%20Ways%23story">All the Myriad Ways</a>", where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.

In any case, even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different <a href="Measure%20%28mathematics%29">measure</a> to different infinite sets). The physicist <a href="David%20Deutsch">David Deutsch</a>, a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that "By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives. When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen." This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories, but a few writers have tried, such as <a href="Greg%20Egan">Greg Egan</a> in his short story "The Infinite Assassin", where an agent is trying to contain reality-scrambling "whirlpools" that form around users of a certain drug, and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves, attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences, he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves.

Many writers—perhaps the majority—avoid the discussion entirely. In one novel of this type, H. Beam Piper's "<a href="Lord%20Kalvan%20of%20Otherwhen">Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen</a>", a Pennsylvania State Police officer, who knows how to make gunpowder, is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors. The paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it, where the country "will" be overrun, but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed, remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved.

The cross-time theme was further developed in the 1960s by <a href="Keith%20Laumer">Keith Laumer</a> in the first three volumes of his "Imperium" sequence, which would be completed in "Zone Yellow" (1990). Piper's politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by <a href="Michael%20Kurland">Michael Kurland</a> and <a href="Jack%20Chalker">Jack Chalker</a> in the 1980s; Chalker's "<a href="G.O.D.%20Inc">G.O.D. Inc</a>" trilogy (1987–89), featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz, marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural. Kurland's "<a href="Perchance%20%28novel%29">Perchance</a>" (1988), the first volume of the never-completed "Chronicles of Elsewhen", presents a multiverse of secretive cross-time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross-time travel, ranging from high-tech capsules to mutant powers. Harry Turtledove has launched the <a href="Crosstime%20Traffic">Crosstime Traffic</a> series for teenagers featuring a variant of H. Beam Piper's paratime trading empire.

The concept of a cross-time version of a world war, involving rival paratime empires, was developed in <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s Change War series, starting with the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> winning "<a href="The%20Big%20Time">The Big Time</a>" (1958); followed by <a href="Richard%20C.%20Meredith">Richard C. Meredith</a>'s "Timeliner" trilogy in the 1970s, <a href="Michael%20McCollum">Michael McCollum</a>'s "A Greater Infinity" (1982) and <a href="John%20Barnes%20%28author%29">John Barnes'</a> "Timeline Wars" trilogy in the 1990s.

Such "paratime" stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next, providing a science fictional explanation—or veneer—for what is normally fantasy. <a href="Aaron%20Allston">Aaron Allston</a>'s "Doc Sidhe" and "Sidhe Devil" take place between our world, the "grim world" and an alternate "fair world" where the Sidhe retreated to. Although technology is clearly present in both worlds, and the "fair world" parallels our history, about fifty years out of step, there is functional magic in the fair world. Even with such explanation, the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world, the more likely the story is to be labelled fantasy, as in Poul Anderson's "House Rule" and "Loser's Night". In both science fiction and fantasy, whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear. The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept, or may present the universe without explanation of its existence.

Keith Laumer's "<a href="Worlds%20of%20the%20Imperium">Worlds of the Imperium</a>" is one of the earliest alternate history novels: It was published by "<a href="Fantastic%20%28magazine%29">Fantastic Stories of the Imagination</a>" in 1961 in magazine form, and reprinted by <a href="Ace%20Books">Ace Books</a> in 1962 as one half of an <a href="Ace%20Double">Ace Double</a>. Besides our world. Laumer describes a world in which the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> never happened, ruled by Britain; and a world ruled by a ruthless dictatorship.

In 1962, <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> published "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20High%20Castle">The Man in the High Castle</a>", an alternate history in which Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won World War II. This book contained an example of "alternate-alternate" history, in that one of its characters is the author of a book depicting a reality in which the Allies won the war, itself divergent from real-world history in several aspects.

It was followed by <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>'s "" (1969), a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by <a href="Russian%20Empire">Czarist Russia</a>, and that borrows from Dick's idea of "alternate-alternate" history (the world of Nabokov's hero is wracked by rumors of a "counter-earth" that apparently is ours). Some critics believe that the references to a counter-earth suggest that the world portrayed in "Ada" is a delusion in the mind of the hero (another favorite theme of Dick's novels). Strikingly, the characters in "Ada" seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version, calling it "Anti-Terra" while its mythical twin is the real "Terra." Not only history but science has followed a divergent path on Anti-Terra: it boasts all the same technology as our world, but all based on water instead of electricity, when a character in "Ada" makes a long-distance call, all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power.

<a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s short story "<a href="What%20If%E2%80%94">What If—</a>" is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television-like device. This idea can also be found in Asimov's 1955 novel "<a href="The%20End%20of%20Eternity">The End of Eternity</a>". In that novel, the "Eternals" can change the realities of the world, without people being aware of it.

<a href="Guido%20Morselli">Guido Morselli</a> described the defeat of Italy (and subsequently France) in World War I in his 1975 novel "Past Conditional" ("") where the static <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Alpine front</a> line which divided Italy from Austria during that war collapses when the Germans and the Austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance.

<a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a> set his 1976 novel "<a href="The%20Alteration">The Alteration</a>" in the 20th century, but major events in the Reformation did not take place, and Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of New England. <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became Pope Germanian I.

2002 saw <a href="Kim%20Stanley%20Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a> publish "<a href="The%20Years%20of%20Rice%20and%20Salt">The Years of Rice and Salt</a>", starting at the <a href="point%20of%20divergence">point of divergence</a> with <a href="Timur">Timur</a> turning his army away from Europe, where the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> has killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of only a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a> 1405 (807 <a href="Islamic%20calendar">AH</a>) to about AD 2045 (1467 AH). Rather than following the <a href="Great%20Man%20theory">Great Man theory</a> of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and major events, Robinson writes more about <a href="social%20history">social history</a>, similar to the <a href="Annales%20School">Annales School</a> of history theory and <a href="Marxist%20historiography">Marxist historiography</a>, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place.

"<a href="The%20Plot%20Against%20America">The Plot Against America</a>" (2004) by <a href="Philip%20Roth">Philip Roth</a> looks at an America where <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States, and <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> is elected, leading to a U.S. that features increasing fascism and anti-Semitism.

<a href="Michael%20Chabon">Michael Chabon</a>, occasionally an author of speculative fiction, contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel "<a href="The%20Yiddish%20Policemen%27s%20Union">The Yiddish Policemen's Union</a>". This book explores a world in which the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world's Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement. The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the Yiddish-speaking semi-autonomous city state of <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>. Stylistically, Chabon borrows heavily from the <a href="noir%20fiction">noir</a> and detective fiction genres, while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture. Apart from the alternate history of the Jews and Israel, Chabon also plays with other common tropes of AH Fiction; in the book, Germany actually loses the war even "harder" than they did in reality, getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing a ground war (subverting the common "what if Germany won WWII?" trope).

The late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular-fiction versions of alternate history, fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author <a href="Harry%20Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>, as well as the development of the <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> genre and two series of anthologies—the "What Might Have Been" series edited by <a href="Gregory%20Benford">Gregory Benford</a> and the "Alternate ..." series edited by <a href="Mike%20Resnick">Mike Resnick</a>. This period also saw alternate history works by <a href="S.%20M.%20Stirling">S. M. Stirling</a>, Kim Stanley Robinson, <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>, <a href="Howard%20Waldrop">Howard Waldrop</a>, and others.

Since the late 1990s, <a href="Harry%20Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title "Master of Alternate History" by some. His books include those of <a href="Southern%20Victory">Timeline 191</a> (a.k.a. Southern Victory, also known as TL-191), in which, while the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> won the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the Union and <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial Germany</a> defeat the Entente Powers in the two "Great War"s of the 1910s and 1940s (with a Nazi-esque Confederate government attempting to exterminate its Black population), and the <a href="Worldwar%20series">Worldwar series</a>, in which aliens invaded Earth during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Other stories by Turtledove include "<a href="A%20Different%20Flesh">A Different Flesh</a>", in which <a href="Americas">America</a> was not colonized from <a href="Asia">Asia</a> during the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>; "<a href="In%20the%20Presence%20of%20Mine%20Enemies%20%282003%20novel%29">In the Presence of Mine Enemies</a>", in which the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a> won World War II; and "<a href="Ruled%20Britannia">Ruled Britannia</a>", in which the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a> succeeded in conquering Britain in the <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan era</a>, with <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the Britons to rise up against their <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spanish</a> conquerors. He also co-authored a book with actor <a href="Richard%20Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>, "<a href="The%20Two%20Georges">The Two Georges</a>", in which the United Kingdom retained the American colonies, with <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> making peace. He did a two-volume series in which the Japanese not only <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">bombed Pearl Harbor</a> but also invaded and occupied the Hawaiian Islands.

Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which <a href="Axis%20victory%20in%20World%20War%20II">the Nazis won World War Two</a>. In some versions, the Nazis and/or <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a> conquer the entire world; in others, they conquer most of the world but a "Fortress America" exists under siege; while in others, there is a Nazi/Japanese <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> comparable to the US/Soviet equivalent in 'our' timeline. "<a href="Fatherland%20%28novel%29">Fatherland</a>" (1992), by <a href="Robert%20Harris%20%28novelist%29">Robert Harris</a>, is set in Europe following the Nazi victory. Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel, for instance <a href="James%20P.%20Hogan%20%28writer%29">James P. Hogan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Proteus%20Operation">The Proteus Operation</a>". <a href="Norman%20Spinrad">Norman Spinrad</a> wrote "<a href="The%20Iron%20Dream">The Iron Dream</a>" in 1972, which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> after fleeing from Europe to North America in the 1920s.

In <a href="Jo%20Walton">Jo Walton</a>'s "Small Change" series, the United Kingdom made peace with Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II, and fascism slowly strangled the UK. Former House Speaker <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> and <a href="William%20R.%20Forstchen">William R. Forstchen</a> have written a novel, "<a href="1945%20%28Gingrich%20novel%29">1945</a>", in which the U.S. defeated <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> but not <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> in World War II, resulting in a Cold War with Germany rather than the Soviet Union. Gingrich and Forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel; instead, they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War, starting with "", in which the Confederates win a victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> - however, after Lincoln responds by bringing Grant and his forces to the eastern theater, the Army of Northern Virginia is soon trapped and destroyed in Maryland, and the war ends within weeks. Also from that general era, <a href="Martin%20Cruz%20Smith">Martin Cruz Smith</a>, in his first novel, posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in "The Indians Won" (1970).

Beginning with "<a href="The%20Probability%20Broach">The Probability Broach</a>" in 1980, <a href="L.%20Neil%20Smith">L. Neil Smith</a> wrote <a href="North%20American%20Confederacy">several novels</a> that postulated the disintegration of the U.S. Federal Government after <a href="Albert%20Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a> joins the <a href="Whiskey%20Rebellion">Whiskey Rebellion</a> in 1794 and eventually leads to the creation of a <a href="libertarian%20utopia">libertarian utopia</a>.

A recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches. These communities are transported from the present (or the near-future) to the past or to another time-line via a natural disaster, the action of technologically advanced aliens, or a human experiment gone wrong. <a href="S.%20M.%20Stirling">S. M. Stirling</a> wrote the "<a href="Island%20in%20the%20Sea%20of%20Time">Island in the Sea of Time</a>" trilogy, in which <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a> Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> times to become the world's first superpower. In <a href="Eric%20Flint">Eric Flint</a>'s <a href="1632%20series">1632 series</a>, a small town in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> is transported to 17th century central Europe and drastically changes the course of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, which was then underway. <a href="John%20Birmingham">John Birmingham</a>'s "<a href="Axis%20of%20Time">Axis of Time</a>" trilogy deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from 2021 finds itself back in 1942 helping the Allies against the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> and the Germans (and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons). Similarly, <a href="Robert%20Charles%20Wilson">Robert Charles Wilson</a>'s "<a href="Mysterium%20%28novel%29">Mysterium</a>" depicts a failed U.S. government experiment which transports a small American town into an alternative version of the U.S. run by believers in a form of Christianity known as <a href="Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a>, who are engaged in a bitter war with the "Spanish" in Mexico (the chief scientist at the laboratory where the experiment occurred is described as a Gnostic, and references to Christian Gnosticism appear repeatedly in the book).

Many fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world, but with magic added. Some posit points of divergence, but some also feature magic altering history all along. One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is Poul Anderson's "<a href="Three%20Hearts%20and%20Three%20Lions">Three Hearts and Three Lions</a>" in which the <a href="Matter%20of%20France">Matter of France</a> is history, and the fairy folk are real and powerful. A partly familiar European history for which the author provides a point of divergence is <a href="Randall%20Garrett">Randall Garrett</a>'s "<a href="Lord%20Darcy%20%28character%29">Lord Darcy</a>" series: a monk systemizing magic rather than science, so the use of <a href="digitalis">foxglove</a> to treat heart disease is called superstition. The other great point of divergence in this timeline occurs in 1199, when <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard the Lionheart</a> survives the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Ch%C3%A2lus-Chabrol">Siege of Chaluz</a> and returns to England, making the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a> so strong it survives into the 20th century.

"<a href="Jonathan%20Strange%20%26amp%3B%20Mr%20Norrell">Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell</a>" takes place in an alternative version of England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed in Northumbria for over 300 years. In <a href="Patricia%20Wrede">Patricia Wrede</a>'s Regency fantasies, Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards, and in Poul Anderson's "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Tempest">A Midsummer Tempest</a>" William Shakespeare is remembered as the Great Historian, with the novel itself taking place in the era of <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> and <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, with an alternate outcome for the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> and an earlier <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.

"<a href="The%20Tales%20of%20Alvin%20Maker">The Tales of Alvin Maker</a>" series by <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a> (a parallel to the life of <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a>, founder of the <a href="Latter%20Day%20Saint%20movement">Latter Day Saint movement</a>) takes place in an alternate America, beginning in the early 19th century. Prior to that time, a POD occurred: England, under the control of Oliver Cromwell, had banished "makers", or anyone else demonstrating "knacks" (an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats) to the North American continent. Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts, and counted on them as a part of their daily lives. The political division of the continent is considerably altered, with two large English colonies bookending a smaller "American" nation, one aligned with England, and the other governed by exiled <a href="Cavaliers">Cavaliers</a>. Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light: Ben Franklin is revered as the continent's finest "maker", George Washington was executed at the hands of an English army, and "Tom" Jefferson is the first president of "Appalachia", the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British.

On the other hand, when the "Old Ones" still manifest themselves in England in <a href="Keith%20Roberts">Keith Roberts</a>'s "<a href="Pavane%20%28novel%29">Pavane</a>", which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a> allowed the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a> to conquer England, the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible: the fairies really were present all along, in a secret history. Again, in the English Renaissance fantasy "Armor of Light" by <a href="Melissa%20Scott%20%28writer%29">Melissa Scott</a> and Lisa A. Barnett, the magic used in the book, by Dr. <a href="John%20Dee%20%28mathematician%29">John Dee</a> and others, actually was practiced in the Renaissance; positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD, Sir <a href="Philip%20Sidney">Philip Sidney</a>'s surviving the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zutphen">Battle of Zutphen</a> in 1586, and shortly thereafter saving the life of <a href="Christopher%20Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>.

Many works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function, and where the consequences of such reality would not, in fact, disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history. Many ambiguous alternate/secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre-Renaissance times, and may explicitly include a "retreat" from the world, which would explain the current absence of such phenomena.

When the magical version of our world's history is set in contemporary times, the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and <a href="contemporary%20fantasy">contemporary fantasy</a>, using in effect a form of secret history (as when <a href="Josepha%20Sherman">Josepha Sherman</a>'s "Son of Darkness" has an elf living in New York City, in disguise) on the other. In works such as <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s "Magic, Incorporated" where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and Poul Anderson's "<a href="Operation%20Chaos%20%28novel%29">Operation Chaos</a>" and its sequel "<a href="Operation%20Luna">Operation Luna</a>", where djinns are serious weapons of war—with atomic bombs—the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history—although references in "Operation Chaos" to <a href="degaussing">degaussing</a> the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD. The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in 1901, resulting in the theory of "rhea tics". <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a> applies this theory to "degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces." This results in the suppression of <a href="ferromagnetism">ferromagnetism</a> and the re-emergence of magic and magical creatures.

Alternate history shades off into other <a href="fantasy%20subgenres">fantasy subgenres</a> when the use of actual, though altered, history and geography decreases, although a culture may still be clearly the original source; <a href="Barry%20Hughart">Barry Hughart</a>'s "<a href="Bridge%20of%20Birds">Bridge of Birds</a>" and its sequels take place in a <a href="fantasy%20world">fantasy world</a>, albeit one clearly based on China, and with allusions to actual Chinese history, such as <a href="Empress%20Wu%20of%20Zhou">the Empress Wu</a>. <a href="Richard%20Garfinkle">Richard Garfinkle</a>'s "<a href="Celestial%20Matters">Celestial Matters</a>" incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek <a href="Aristotelian%20physics">Aristotelian physics</a>, using them as if factual.

A fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children's writer <a href="Diana%20Wynne%20Jones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> in her "<a href="Chrestomanci">Chrestomanci</a>" quartet (1977–1988), with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents. Among the novels in this series, "<a href="Witch%20Week">Witch Week</a>" stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci's own world rather than our own (and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the "normal" history of most worlds visited by the wizard).

Terry Pratchett's works include several references to alternate histories of <a href="Discworld">Discworld</a>. "<a href="Men%20At%20Arms">Men At Arms</a>" observes that in millions of universes, Edward d'Eath became an obsessive recluse rather than the instigator of the plot that he is in the novel. In "<a href="Jingo%20%28novel%29">Jingo</a>", Vimes accidentally picks up a pocket organizer that should have gone down another leg of the Trousers of Time, and so can hear the organizer reporting on the deaths that would have occurred had his decision gone otherwise. Indeed, Discworld contains an equivalent of the Time Patrol in its <a href="History%20Monks">History Monks</a>. "Night Watch" revolves around a repair of history after a time traveller’s murder of an important figure in Vimes's past. "<a href="Thief%20of%20Time">Thief of Time</a>" presents them functioning as a full-scale Time Patrol, ensuring that history occurs at all.

Alternate history has long been a staple of Japanese speculative fiction with such authors as <a href="Futaro%20Yamada">Futaro Yamada</a> and <a href="Ry%C5%8D%20Hanmura">Ryō Hanmura</a> writing novels set in recognizable historical settings with supernatural or science fiction elements present. In 1973, Ryō Hanmura wrote "<a href="Musubi%20no%20Yama%20Hiroku">Musubi no Yama Hiroku</a>" which recreated 400 years of Japan's history from the perspective of a secret magical family with psychic abilities. The novel has since come to be recognized as a masterpiece of Japanese speculative fiction. Twelve years later, author <a href="Hiroshi%20Aramata">Hiroshi Aramata</a> wrote the groundbreaking "<a href="Teito%20Monogatari">Teito Monogatari</a>" which reimagined the history of <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> across the 20th century in a world heavily influenced by the supernatural.

The TV show "<a href="Sliders">Sliders</a>" explores different possible alternate realities by having the protagonist "slide" into different parallel dimensions of the same planet Earth.

The two-part Theatre play "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Cursed%20Child">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a>" contains alternate timelines set within the world of <a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>.

In "<a href="World%20of%20Winx">World of Winx</a>," the seven fairies- Bloom, Stella, Musa, Tecna, Flora, Aisha and Roxy- live on Earth, where humans are ignorant of the existence of fairies or belief in magic; much unlike the <a href="Winx%20Club%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> of "Winx Club", where they had brought all magic back to Earth by releasing its terrestrial fairies.

For the same reasons that this genre is explored by role-playing games, alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s. A famous example of an alternate history game is "". Released in 1996, the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> goes back in time to prevent World War II from ever taking place by erasing <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> from time after he is released from <a href="Landsberg%20Prison">Landsberg Prison</a> in 1924. He is successful in his mission, but in the process allows <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> to become powerful enough to launch a massive campaign to conquer Europe.

In the "<a href="Civilization%20%28series%29">Civilization</a>" series, the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day, creating radically altered versions of history on a long time-scale. Several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the "point of divergence" in an alternate history shaped by the player's actions. Popular examples in "<a href="Civilization%20IV">Sid Meier's Civilization IV</a>" include "Desert War", set in the Mediterranean theatre of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles; "Broken Star", set in a hypothetical Russian civil war in 2010; and "<a href="Rhye%27s%20and%20Fall%20of%20Civilization">Rhye's and Fall of Civilization</a>", an 'Earth simulator' designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings.

In some games such as the "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20%28series%29">Metal Gear</a>" and "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" series, events that were originally intended to represent the near future at the time the games were originally released later ended up becoming alternate histories in later entries in those franchises. For example, "" (1990), set in 1999, depicted a near future that ended up becoming an alternate history in "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>" (1998). Likewise, "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Resident%20Evil%202">Resident Evil 2</a>" (1998), both set in 1998, depicted near-future events that had later become an alternative history by the time "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>" (2005) was released.

In the 2009 <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> shooter, "<a href="Damnation%20%28video%20game%29">Damnation</a>" is set on an alternate version of planet Earth, in the early part of the 20th century after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, which had spanned over several decades, where steam engines replace combustion engines. The game sees the protagonists fighting off a rich industrialist who wants to do away with both the Union and Confederacy in one swift movement and turn the United States of America into a country called the "American Empire" with a totalitarian dictatorship.
"<a href="Crimson%20Skies">Crimson Skies</a>" is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpretations in multiple genres. The stories and games in "Crimson Skies" take place in an alternate 1930s United States, where the nation crumbled into many hostile states following the effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a>, and <a href="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>. With the road and railway system destroyed, commerce took to the skies, which led to the emergence of <a href="air%20pirate">air pirate</a> gangs who plunder the aerial commerce.

The game "<a href="Freedom%20Fighters%20%28video%20game%29">Freedom Fighters</a>" portrays a situation similar to that of the movie "<a href="Red%20Dawn">Red Dawn</a>" and "Red Alert 2", though less comically than the latter. The point of divergence is during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, where the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. With the balance of power and influence tipped in Russia's favor, history diverges; brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the Communist bloc's complete takeover of Europe by 1953, a different ending to the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, and the spread of Soviet influence into South America and Mexico.

Similarly, the 2007 video game "<a href="World%20in%20Conflict">World in Conflict</a>" is set in 1989, with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> on the verge of collapse. The point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game, when <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> forces staged a desperate invasion of Western Europe. As the game begins, a Soviet invasion force lands in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, taking advantage of the fact that most of the US military is in Europe.

The game "", released in 2008, offered in alternate history campaign for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, wherein Japan destroys all three carriers in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, which follows with a successful invasion of the island. Because of this, the United States lacked any sort of aerial power to fight the Japanese, and is continuously forced into the defense.

"", released in February 2008, is an alternate history <a href="first%20person%20shooter">first person shooter</a> where <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> died in 1931 from being hit by a taxi cab. Because of this, <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> lacks the charismatic leader needed to keep the country together and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> successfully conquers Great Britain via <a href="Operation%20Sea%20Lion">Operation Sea Lion</a> in 1940. Germany later conquers the rest of Europe, North Africa and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> while mass-producing their <a href="wunderwaffe">wunderwaffe</a>. The <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist United States' <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Eastern Seaboard</a> in 1953, which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government.

Atomic orbital

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, an atomic orbital is a <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">mathematical function</a> that describes the wave-like behavior of either one <a href="electron">electron</a> or a pair of electrons in an <a href="atom">atom</a>. This function can be used to calculate the <a href="probability">probability</a> of finding any electron of an atom in any specific region around the <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">atom's nucleus</a>. The term, atomic orbital, may also refer to the physical region or space where the electron can be calculated to be present, as defined by the particular mathematical form of the orbital.

Each orbital in an atom is characterized by a unique set of values of the three <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s , , and , which respectively correspond to the electron's <a href="energy">energy</a>, <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>, and an angular momentum <a href="vector%20component">vector component</a> (the <a href="magnetic%20quantum%20number">magnetic quantum number</a>). Each such orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons, each with its own <a href="spin%20quantum%20number">spin quantum number</a> . The simple names s orbital, p orbital, d orbital and f orbital refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number and respectively. These names, together with the value of , are used to describe the <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>s of atoms. They are derived from the description by early spectroscopists of certain series of <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a> <a href="Spectral%20line">spectroscopic lines</a> as sharp, principal, diffuse, and fundamental. Orbitals for > 3 continue alphabetically, omitting j (g, h, i, k, …) because some languages do not distinguish between the letters "i" and "j".

Atomic orbitals are the basic building blocks of the atomic orbital model (alternatively known as the electron cloud or wave mechanics model), a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter. In this model the electron cloud of a multi-electron atom may be seen as being built up (in approximation) in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler <a href="hydrogen%20atom">hydrogen-like</a> atomic orbitals. The repeating "periodicity" of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 <a href="Chemical%20element">elements</a> within sections of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s, p, d and f atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the quantum number , particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the <a href="Aufbau%20principle">order</a> in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = [Ar]4"s"3"d" and Cr = [Ar]3"d") can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.

With the development of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and experimental findings (such as the two slits diffraction of electrons), it was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but needed to be explained by the <a href="Wave%E2%80%93particle%20duality">wave-particle duality</a>. In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:

Wave-like properties:

Particle-like properties:

Thus, despite the popular analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles. In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped "atmosphere" (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this "atmosphere" only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom's "electron cloud") tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing where the atom’s electrons will be found. This is due to the uncertainty principle.

Atomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an <a href="eigenstate">eigenstate</a> of the atomic <a href="Hamiltonian%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">Hamiltonian</a>, is approximated by an expansion (see <a href="configuration%20interaction">configuration interaction</a> expansion and <a href="basis%20set%20%28chemistry%29">basis set</a>) into <a href="linear%20combination">linear combination</a>s of anti-symmetrized products (<a href="Slater%20determinant">Slater determinant</a>s) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals. (When one considers also their <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> component, one speaks of atomic spin orbitals.) A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this <a href="Nuclear%20structure%23The%20independent-particle%20model">independent-particle model</a> of products of single electron wave functions. (The <a href="London%20dispersion%20force">London dispersion force</a>, for example, depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons.)

In <a href="atomic%20physics">atomic physics</a>, the <a href="atomic%20spectral%20line">atomic spectral line</a>s correspond to transitions (<a href="Atomic%20electron%20transition">quantum leaps</a>) between <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>s of an atom. These states are labeled by a set of <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s summarized in the <a href="term%20symbol">term symbol</a> and usually associated with particular electron configurations, i.e., by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals (for example, 1s 2s 2p for the ground state of <a href="neon">neon</a>—term symbol: S).

This notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the <a href="configuration%20interaction">configuration interaction</a> expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given <a href="Atomic%20electron%20transition">transition</a>. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that electrons are <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s ruled by the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a> and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when <a href="electron%20correlation">electron correlation</a> is large.

Fundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital vision which (even if it is not spelled out) is heavily influenced by this <a href="Hartree%E2%80%93Fock">Hartree–Fock</a> approximation, which is one way to reduce the complexities of <a href="molecular%20orbital%20theory">molecular orbital theory</a>.

Atomic orbitals can be the hydrogen-like "orbitals" which are exact solutions to the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a> for a <a href="Hydrogen-like%20atom">hydrogen-like "atom"</a> (i.e., an atom with one electron). Alternatively, atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron (i.e., orbitals) but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule. The <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinate system</a>s chosen for atomic orbitals are usually <a href="spherical%20coordinates">spherical coordinates</a> in atoms and <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">cartesians</a> in polyatomic molecules. The advantage of spherical coordinates (for atoms) is that an orbital wave function is a product of three factors each dependent on a single coordinate: . The angular factors of atomic orbitals generate s, p, d, etc. functions as <a href="Spherical%20harmonics%23Real%20form">real combinations</a> of <a href="spherical%20harmonics">spherical harmonics</a> (where and are quantum numbers). There are typically three mathematical forms for the radial functions  which can be chosen as a starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules with many electrons:


Although hydrogen-like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools, the advent of computers has made STOs preferable for atoms and diatomic molecules since combinations of STOs can replace the nodes in hydrogen-like atomic orbital. Gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms. Although not as accurate by themselves as STOs, combinations of many Gaussians can attain the accuracy of hydrogen-like orbitals.

The term "orbital" was coined by <a href="Robert%20Mulliken">Robert Mulliken</a> in 1932 as an abbreviation for "one-electron orbital wave function". However, the idea that electrons might revolve around a compact nucleus with definite angular momentum was convincingly argued at least 19 years earlier by <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, and the Japanese physicist <a href="Hantaro%20Nagaoka">Hantaro Nagaoka</a> published an orbit-based hypothesis for electronic behavior as early as 1904. Explaining the behavior of these electron "orbits" was one of the driving forces behind the development of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

With <a href="J.J.%20Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a>'s discovery of the electron in 1897, it became clear that atoms were not the smallest building blocks of nature, but were rather composite particles. The newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atom's constituent parts might interact with each other. Thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit-like rings within a positively charged jelly-like substance, and between the electron's discovery and 1909, this "<a href="plum%20pudding%20model">plum pudding model</a>" was the most widely accepted explanation of atomic structure.

Shortly after Thomson's discovery, <a href="Hantaro%20Nagaoka">Hantaro Nagaoka</a> predicted a different model for electronic structure. Unlike the plum pudding model, the positive charge in Nagaoka's "Saturnian Model" was concentrated into a central core, pulling the electrons into circular orbits reminiscent of Saturn's rings. Few people took notice of Nagaoka's work at the time, and Nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception, namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, the <a href="Saturnian%20model">Saturnian model</a> turned out to have more in common with modern theory than any of its contemporaries.

In 1909, <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> discovered that the bulk of the atomic mass was tightly condensed into a nucleus, which was also found to be positively charged. It became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure. In 1913 as Rutherford's post-doctoral student, <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> proposed a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete values of angular momentum, quantized in units <a href="reduced%20Planck%20constant">"h"/2π</a>. This constraint automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies. The <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state (by declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines.
After Bohr's use of <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein</a>'s explanation of the <a href="photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric effect</a> to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the <a href="Emission%20spectra">emission</a> and <a href="absorption%20spectra">absorption spectra</a> of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the Bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was, however, "not" achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as <a href="matter%20waves">matter waves</a> was not suggested until eleven years later. Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.

With <a href="Louis%20de%20Broglie">de Broglie</a>'s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924, and for a short time before the full 1926 <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a> treatment of <a href="hydrogen-like%20atom">hydrogen-like atom</a>, a Bohr electron "wavelength" could be seen to be a function of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this physically incorrect Bohr model is still often taught to beginning students). The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.

The Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. The energies of electrons in the "n" = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that <a href="helium">helium</a> (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and <a href="argon">argon</a> (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> explains this in terms of <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>s and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>. Thus the "n" = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the "n" = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all "n" = 1 states are fully occupied; the same for "n" = 1 and "n" = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.

Immediately after <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Heisenberg</a> discovered his <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a>, <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Bohr</a> noted that the existence of any sort of <a href="wave%20packet">wave packet</a> implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself. In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus, the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space, increases without bound, as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.

In chemistry, <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Schrödinger</a>, <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Pauling</a>, <a href="Robert%20S.%20Mulliken">Mulliken</a> and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a <a href="probability%20distribution">probability distribution</a> which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom.

In the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schrödinger and others, the Bohr atom number "n" for each orbital became known as an "n-sphere" in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.

Orbitals are given names in the form:
where "X" is the energy level corresponding to the <a href="principal%20quantum%20number">principal quantum number</a> , type is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or <a href="Electron%20shell%23Subshells">subshell</a> of the orbital and it corresponds to the <a href="angular%20quantum%20number">angular quantum number</a> , and is the number of electrons in that orbital.

For example, the orbital 1s (pronounced "one ess two") has two electrons and is the lowest energy level () and has an angular quantum number of . In <a href="X-ray%20notation">X-ray notation</a>, the principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it. For , the letters associated with those numbers are K, L, M, N, O, … respectively.

The simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a single electron, such as the <a href="hydrogen%20atom">hydrogen atom</a>. An atom of any other element <a href="ion">ion</a>ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the <a href="eigenstates">eigenstates</a> of the <a href="Hamiltonian%20operator">Hamiltonian operator</a> for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see <a href="hydrogen%20atom">hydrogen atom</a>).

For atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are "qualitatively" similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and precise analysis, the numerical approximations must be used.

A given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers: <a href="Principal%20quantum%20number"></a>, <a href="Azimuthal%20quantum%20number"></a>, and <a href="magnetic%20quantum%20number"></a>. The rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>.

The stationary states (<a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>s) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its atomic orbitals. However, in general, an electron's behavior is not fully described by a single orbital. Electron states are best represented by time-depending "mixtures" (<a href="linear%20combination">linear combination</a>s) of multiple orbitals. See <a href="Linear%20combination%20of%20atomic%20orbitals%20molecular%20orbital%20method">Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method</a>.

The quantum number first appeared in the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of "n" lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of "n" are said to comprise a "<a href="electron%20shell">shell</a>". Orbitals with the same value of "n" and also the same value of  are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a "<a href="electron%20subshell">subshell</a>".

Because of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus, atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum numbers. These quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values, and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed.

In physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:

The <a href="principal%20quantum%20number">principal quantum number</a> describes the energy of the electron and is always a <a href="positive%20integer">positive integer</a>. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of "n"; these orbitals together are sometimes called "<a href="electron%20shells">electron shells</a>".

The <a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number">azimuthal quantum number</a> describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where is some integer , ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation formula_3. For instance, the  shell has only orbitals with formula_4, and the  shell has only orbitals with formula_4, and formula_6. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of  are sometimes collectively called a "subshell".

The <a href="magnetic%20quantum%20number">magnetic quantum number</a>, formula_7, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where formula_8 is some integer formula_9, formula_7 ranges thus: formula_11.

The above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of formula_7 available in that subshell. Empty cells represent subshells that do not exist.

Subshells are usually identified by their formula_13- and formula_8-values. formula_13 is represented by its numerical value, but formula_8 is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's', 1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'. For instance, one may speak of the subshell with formula_17 and formula_4 as a '2s subshell'.

Each electron also has a <a href="spin%20quantum%20number">spin quantum number</a>, s, which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number s can be + or −.

The <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a> states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, (n, l, m), these two electrons must differ in their spin.

The above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the "z" direction in Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing from . As such, the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries. The <a href="Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach%20experiment">Stern–Gerlach experiment</a> — where an atom is exposed to a magnetic field — provides one such example.

An atom that is embedded in a crystalline solid feels multiple preferred axes, but no preferred direction. Instead of building atomic orbitals out of the product of radial functions and a single <a href="spherical%20harmonic">spherical harmonic</a>, linear combinations of spherical harmonics are typically used, designed so that the imaginary part of the spherical harmonics cancel out. These real orbitals are the building blocks most commonly shown in orbital visualizations.

In the real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, and have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but is no longer a good quantum number (though its absolute value is). The orbitals are given new names based on their shape with respect to a standardized Cartesian basis. The real hydrogen-like p orbitals are given by the following

where , , and , are the complex orbitals corresponding to .

The equations for the p and p orbitals depend on the phase convention used for the spherical harmonics. The above equations suppose that the spherical harmonics are defined by formula_22. However some quantum physicists include a phase factor (-1) in these definitions, which has the effect of relating the p orbital to a "difference" of spherical harmonics and the p orbital to the corresponding "sum". (For more detail, see <a href="Spherical%20harmonics%23Conventions">Spherical harmonics#Conventions</a>).

Simple pictures showing orbital shapes are intended to describe the angular forms of regions in space where the electrons occupying the orbital are likely to be found. The diagrams cannot show the entire region where an electron can be found, since according to quantum mechanics there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron (almost) anywhere in space. Instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or <a href="contour%20line">contour surfaces</a> where the probability density has a constant value, chosen so that there is a certain probability (for example 90%) of finding the electron within the contour. Although as the square of an <a href="absolute%20value">absolute value</a> is everywhere non-negative, the sign of the <a href="wave%20function">wave function</a> is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture.

Sometimes the function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the which shows probability density but has no phases (which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since is a complex number). orbital graphs tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than graphs, but have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly graphs.

The lobes can be viewed as <a href="standing%20wave">standing wave</a> <a href="interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> patterns between the two counter rotating, ring resonant <a href="travelling%20wave">travelling wave</a> "" and "" modes, with the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant "" wavelengths around the circumference. Though rarely depicted the travelling wave solutions can be viewed as rotating banded tori, with the bands representing phase information. For each there are two standing wave solutions and . For the case where the orbital is vertical, counter rotating information is unknown, and the orbital is z-axis symmetric. For the case where there are no counter rotating modes. There are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric. For any given , the smaller is, the more radial nodes there are. Loosely speaking "n" is energy, is analogous to <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricity</a>, and is orientation. In the classical case, a ring resonant travelling wave, for example in a circular transmission line, unless actively forced, will spontaneously decay into a ring resonant standing wave because reflections will build up over time at even the smallest imperfection or discontinuity.

Generally speaking, the number determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus: as increases, the size of the orbital increases. When comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the number of electrons in heavier elements (higher ) increases.

Also in general terms, determines an orbital's shape, and its orientation. However, since some orbitals are described by equations in <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s, the shape sometimes depends on also. Together, the whole set of orbitals for a given and fill space as symmetrically as possible, though with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes.

The single s-orbitals (formula_4) are shaped like spheres. For it is roughly a <a href="ball%20%28mathematics%29">solid ball</a> (it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the "wave-structure" is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node "at" the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort to experimentally image the 1"s" and 2"p" orbitials in a SrTiO crystal using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).

The shapes of p, d and f-orbitals are described verbally here and shown graphically in the "Orbitals table" below. The three p-orbitals for have the form of two <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>s with a <a href="point%20of%20tangency">point of tangency</a> at the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> (the two-lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a "<a href="dumbbell">dumbbell</a>"—there are two lobes pointing in opposite directions from each other). The three p-orbitals in each <a href="Electron%20shell">shell</a> are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective linear combination of values of . The overall result is a lobe pointing along each direction of the primary axes.

Four of the five d-orbitals for look similar, each with four pear-shaped lobes, each lobe tangent at right angles to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes—the lobes are between the pairs of primary axes—and the fourth has the centres along the x and y axes themselves. The fifth and final d-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a <a href="torus">torus</a> with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis. The overall total of 18 directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair.

There are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-orbitals.

Additionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g orbitals with values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p), an additional node in each lobe. Still higher values of further increase the number of radial nodes, for each type of orbital.

The shapes of atomic orbitals in one-electron atom are related to 3-dimensional <a href="spherical%20harmonics">spherical harmonics</a>. These shapes are not unique, and any linear combination is valid, like a transformation to <a href="cubic%20harmonic">cubic harmonic</a>s, in fact it is possible to generate sets where all the d's are the same shape, just like the and are the same shape.
It should be noted that while individual orbitals are most often shown independent of each other, the orbitals coexist around the nucleus at the same time.

This table shows all orbital configurations for the real hydrogen-like wave functions up to 7s, and therefore covers the simple electronic configuration for all elements in the periodic table up to <a href="radium">radium</a>. "ψ" graphs are shown with − and + <a href="wave%20function">wave function</a> phases shown in two different colors (arbitrarily red and blue). The orbital is the same as the orbital, but the and are formed by taking linear
combinations of the and orbitals (which is why they are listed under the label). Also, the and are not
the same shape as the , since they are pure <a href="spherical%20harmonics">spherical harmonics</a>.

The shapes of atomic orbitals can be understood qualitatively by considering the analogous case of <a href="Vibrations%20of%20a%20circular%20drum">standing waves on a circular drum</a>. To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average momentum at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends to "localize" the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the <a href="Heisenberg%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a> for details of the mechanism).

This relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to s orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the <a href="antinode">antinode</a> in all s orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.

A mental "planetary orbit" picture closest to the behavior of electrons in s orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of a <a href="Keplerian%20orbit">Keplerian orbit</a> with the <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> of 1 but a finite major axis, not physically possible (because <a href="particle">particle</a>s were to collide), but can be imagined as a <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limit</a> of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity.

Below, a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave functions of the hydrogen atom are shown. A correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate system and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-coordinate .

None of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-s orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.

In addition, the drum modes analogous to p and d modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to s modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-s orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.

In atoms with a single electron (<a href="hydrogen-like%20atom">hydrogen-like atom</a>s), the energy of an orbital (and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined exclusively by formula_13. The formula_25 orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of formula_13 has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as formula_13 increases. For high formula_13, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with different formula_8 within a given formula_13 are (to a good approximation) degenerate, and have the same energy. This approximation is broken to a slight extent by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus, and by <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a> effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for s electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms; see <a href="Lamb%20shift">Lamb shift</a>.

In atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s of orbitals depend not only on formula_13 but also on formula_8. Higher values of formula_8 are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2p state is higher than the 2s state. When formula_34, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the s-orbital in the next higher shell; when formula_35 the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled.

The increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron–electron interaction effects, and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number, the formula_8 of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers formula_13 of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement.

The energy sequence of the first 35 subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with formula_13 and formula_8 given by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.

"Note: empty cells indicate non-existent sublevels, while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could (potentially) exist, but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known."

Several rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals ("<a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>"). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as well as <a href="Spin%20quantum%20number"></a>, or <a href="spin%20quantum%20number">spin quantum number</a>. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of . However, "only" two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.

Additionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a <a href="photon">photon</a>) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.

This behavior is responsible for the structure of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number "i", it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the "i"th shell. <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> was the first to propose (1923) that the <a href="Periodic%20table">periodicity</a> in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.

The periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular '<a href="Periodic%20table%20block">blocks</a>'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same -state (but the associated with that -state depends upon the period). For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of <a href="Lithium">Li</a> and <a href="Beryllium">Be</a> respectively belong to the 2s subshell, and those of <a href="sodium">Na</a> and <a href="magnesium">Mg</a> to the 3s subshell.

The following is the order for filling the "subshell" orbitals, which also gives the order of the "blocks" in the periodic table:

The "periodic" nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the s, p, d and f "blocks", is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows ("periods") in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:

Although this is the general order of orbital filling according to the Madelung rule, there are exceptions, and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms (see ).

The number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>. The electrons in the outermost shell, or "<a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s", tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.

For elements with high atomic number , the effects of relativity become more pronounced, and especially so for s electrons, which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high- atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.

Examples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> (which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding) and the golden color of <a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="caesium">caesium</a> (which results from narrowing of 6s to 5d transition energy to the point that visible light begins to be absorbed).

In the <a href="Bohr%20Model">Bohr Model</a>, an  electron has a velocity given by formula_40, where is the atomic number, formula_41 is the <a href="fine-structure%20constant">fine-structure constant</a>, and is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, therefore, any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a>, which accounts for relativistic effects, the wave function of the electron for atoms with is oscillatory and <a href="unbounded">unbounded</a>. The significance of element 137, also known as <a href="untriseptium">untriseptium</a>, was first pointed out by the physicist <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. Element 137 is sometimes informally called <a href="feynmanium">feynmanium</a> (symbol Fy). However, Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of  due to the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons, resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than . The critical  value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-positron pairs, does not occur until is about 173. These conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators, where such electron-positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed. See <a href="Extension%20of%20the%20periodic%20table%20beyond%20the%20seventh%20period">Extension of the periodic table beyond the seventh period</a>.

There are no nodes in relativistic orbital densities, although individual components of the wave function will have nodes.

Bound quantum states have discrete energy levels. When applied to atomic orbitals, this means that the energy differences between states are also discrete. A transition between these states (i.e., an electron absorbing or emitting a photon) can thus only happen if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states.

Consider two states of the hydrogen atom:

State 1) , , and 

State 2) , , and 

By quantum theory, state 1 has a fixed energy of , and state 2 has a fixed energy of . Now, what would happen if an electron in state 1 were to move to state 2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly . If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value, it cannot jump from state 1 to state 2. Now, suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly will be absorbed by the electron in state 1, and that electron will jump to state 2. However, photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.

The atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.

The atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.

Amino acid

Amino acids are <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s containing <a href="amine">amine</a> (-NH) and <a href="carboxyl">carboxyl</a> (-COOH) <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s, along with a <a href="Substituent">side chain</a> (R group) specific to each amino acid. The key <a href="Chemical_element">elements</a> of an amino acid are <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, although other elements are found in the side chains of certain amino acids. About 500 amino acids are known (though only 20 appear in the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a>) and can be classified in many ways. They can be classified according to the core structural functional groups' locations as <a href="Alpha%20and%20beta%20carbon">alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), gamma- (γ-) or delta- (δ-)</a> amino acids; other categories relate to <a href="Chemical%20polarity">polarity</a>, <a href="pH">pH</a> level, and side chain group type (<a href="aliphatic">aliphatic</a>, <a href="Open-chain%20compound">acyclic</a>, <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a>, containing hydroxyl or <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, etc.). In the form of <a href="protein">protein</a>s, amino acid <a href="Residue%20%28chemistry%29">residues</a> form the second-largest component (water is the largest) of human <a href="muscle">muscle</a>s and other <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a>. Beyond their role as residues in proteins, amino acids participate in a number of processes such as <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> transport and <a href="biosynthesis">biosynthesis</a>.

In <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, amino acids having both the amine and the carboxylic acid groups attached to the <a href="alpha-carbon">first (alpha-) carbon</a> atom have particular importance. They are known as 2-, alpha-, or α-amino acids (generic <a href="Chemical%20formula">formula</a> HNCHRCOOH in most cases, where R is an <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic</a> <a href="substituent">substituent</a> known as a "<a href="Substituent">side chain</a>"); often the term "amino acid" is used to refer specifically to these. They include the 22 <a href="Proteinogenic%20amino%20acid">proteinogenic</a> ("protein-building") amino acids, which combine into <a href="peptide">peptide</a> chains ("polypeptides") to form the building-blocks of a vast array of <a href="protein">protein</a>s. These are all -<a href="stereoisomerism">stereoisomers</a> ("<a href="Chirality%20%28chemistry%29">left-handed</a>" <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s), although a few <a href="D-amino%20acid">-amino acid</a>s ("right-handed") occur in <a href="bacterial%20envelope">bacterial envelope</a>s, as a neuromodulator (-<a href="serine">serine</a>), and in some <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. 

Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet <a href="codon">codon</a>s in the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> and are known as "standard" amino acids. The other two ("non-standard" or "non-canonical") are <a href="selenocysteine">selenocysteine</a> (present in many prokaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by <a href="DNA">DNA</a>), and <a href="pyrrolysine">pyrrolysine</a> (found only in some <a href="archea">archea</a> and one <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>). Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded by <a href="stop%20codon">stop codon</a> and <a href="SECIS%20element">SECIS element</a>. <a href="N-Formylmethionine">"N"-formylmethionine</a> (which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts) is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid. Codon–<a href="transfer%20RNA">tRNA</a> combinations not found in nature can also be used to <a href="Expanded%20genetic%20code">"expand" the genetic code</a> and form novel proteins known as <a href="alloprotein">alloprotein</a>s incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids.

Many important proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids have biological functions. For example, in the <a href="human%20brain">human brain</a>, glutamate (standard <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a>) and <a href="gamma-amino-butyric%20acid">gamma-amino-butyric acid</a> ("GABA", non-standard gamma-amino acid) are, respectively, the main <a href="Neurotransmitter%23Excitatory%20and%20inhibitory">excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters</a>. <a href="Hydroxyproline">Hydroxyproline</a>, a major component of the <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> <a href="collagen">collagen</a>, is synthesised from <a href="proline">proline</a>. <a href="Glycine">Glycine</a> is a biosynthetic precursor to porphyrins used in <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s. <a href="Carnitine">Carnitine</a> is used in <a href="lipid">lipid transport</a>.

Nine proteinogenic amino acids are called <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">"essential"</a> for humans because they cannot be produced from other <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a> by the human body and so must be taken in as food. Others may be <a href="Essential%20amino%20acid%23Essentiality%20vs.%20conditional%20essentiality%20in%20humans">conditionally essential</a> for certain ages or medical conditions. Essential amino acids may also differ between <a href="species">species</a>.

Because of their biological significance, amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in <a href="nutritional%20supplement">nutritional supplement</a>s, <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, and <a href="food%20technology">food technology</a>. Industrial uses include the production of <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">drugs</a>, <a href="biodegradable%20plastic">biodegradable plastic</a>s, and <a href="asymmetric%20catalysis">chiral catalysts</a>.

The first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century. In 1806, French chemists <a href="Louis-Nicolas%20Vauquelin">Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Jean%20Robiquet">Pierre Jean Robiquet</a> isolated a compound in <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a> that was subsequently named <a href="asparagine">asparagine</a>, the first amino acid to be discovered. <a href="Cystine">Cystine</a> was discovered in 1810, although its monomer, <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>, remained undiscovered until 1884. <a href="Glycine">Glycine</a> and <a href="leucine">leucine</a> were discovered in 1820. The last of the 20 common amino acids to be discovered was <a href="threonine">threonine</a> in 1935 by <a href="William%20Cumming%20Rose">William Cumming Rose</a>, who also determined the <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s and established the minimum daily requirements of all amino acids for optimal growth.

Usage of the term "amino acid" in the English language is from 1898. Proteins were found to yield amino acids after enzymatic digestion or acid <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>. In 1902, <a href="Hermann%20Emil%20Fischer">Emil Fischer</a> and <a href="Franz%20Hofmeister">Franz Hofmeister</a> proposed that proteins are the result of the formation of bonds between the amino group of one amino acid with the carboxyl group of another, in a linear structure that Fischer termed "<a href="peptide">peptide</a>".

In the structure shown at the top of the page, R represents a <a href="Substituent">side chain</a> specific to each amino acid. The <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atom next to the <a href="carboxyl%20group">carboxyl group</a> (which is therefore numbered 2 in the <a href="carbon%20chain">carbon chain</a> starting from that functional group) is called the <a href="alpha%20carbon">α–carbon</a>. Amino acids containing an <a href="amino%20group">amino group</a> bonded directly to the alpha carbon are referred to as "alpha amino acids". These include amino acids such as <a href="proline">proline</a> which contain <a href="secondary%20amine">secondary amine</a>s, which used to be often referred to as "imino acids".

The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature, but only when occurring in the -isomer. The alpha carbon is a <a href="chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chiral</a> carbon atom, with the exception of <a href="glycine">glycine</a> which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon. Therefore, all alpha amino acids but <a href="glycine">glycine</a> can exist in either of two <a href="enantiomer">enantiomer</a>s, called or amino acids, which are mirror images of each other ("see also <a href="Chirality%20%28chemistry%29">Chirality</a>"). While -amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in <a href="protein">protein</a>s during translation in the ribosome, -amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme <a href="posttranslational%20modification">posttranslational modification</a>s after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as <a href="cone%20snail">cone snail</a>s. They are also abundant components of the <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s of bacteria, and -serine may act as a <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> in the brain. -amino acids are used in <a href="racemic%20crystallography">racemic crystallography</a> to create centrosymmetric crystals, which (depending on the protein) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination. The and convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of <a href="glyceraldehyde">glyceraldehyde</a> from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory; -glyceraldehyde is levorotatory).
In alternative fashion, the <a href="Cahn%E2%80%93Ingold%E2%80%93Prelog%20priority%20rules">"(S)" and "(R)" designators</a> are used to indicate the absolute <a href="stereochemistry">stereochemistry</a>. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are "(S)" at the α carbon, with cysteine being "(R)" and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the "R/S" terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.

In amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the α–carbon (such as <a href="lysine">lysine</a>, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as α, β, γ, δ, and so on. In some amino acids, the amine group is attached to the β or γ-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as "beta" or "gamma amino acids".

Amino acids are usually classified by the <a href="chemical%20property">properties</a> of their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a <a href="weak%20acid">weak acid</a> or a <a href="weak%20base">weak base</a>, and a <a href="hydrophile">hydrophile</a> if the side chain is <a href="polar%20molecule">polar</a> or a <a href="hydrophobe">hydrophobe</a> if it is <a href="nonpolar">nonpolar</a>. The <a href="chemical%20structure">chemical structure</a>s of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these <a href="proteinogenic%20amino%20acid">proteinogenic amino acid</a>s.

The phrase "<a href="branched-chain%20amino%20acid">branched-chain amino acid</a>s" or BCAA refers to the amino acids having <a href="aliphatic">aliphatic</a> side chains that are non-linear; these are <a href="leucine">leucine</a>, <a href="isoleucine">isoleucine</a>, and <a href="valine">valine</a>. <a href="Proline">Proline</a> is the only <a href="proteinogenic">proteinogenic</a> amino acid whose side-group links to the α-amino group and, thus, is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position. In chemical terms, proline is, therefore, an <a href="imino%20acid">imino acid</a>, since it lacks a <a href="amine">primary amino group</a>, although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature, and may also be called an "N-alkylated alpha-amino acid".

The α-<a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> group of amino acids is a <a href="weak%20acid">weak acid</a>, meaning that it releases a <a href="Hydron%20%28chemistry%29">hydron</a> (such as a <a href="proton">proton</a>) at moderate pH values. In other words, carboxylic acid groups (−COH) can be <a href="deprotonated">deprotonated</a> to become negative <a href="carboxylate">carboxylate</a>s (−CO ). The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the <a href="pKa">pKa</a> of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above). In a complementary fashion, the α-<a href="amine">amine</a> of amino acids is a <a href="weak%20base">weak base</a>, meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values. In other words, α-amino groups (NH−) can be <a href="protonated">protonated</a> to become positive α-ammonium groups (NH−). The positively charged α-ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4).

Because all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups, they share <a href="Amphoterism">amphiprotic</a> properties. Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive α-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral α-amino group (net charge −1). But at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive α-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge. This molecular state is known as a <a href="zwitterion">zwitterion</a>, from the German Zwitter meaning "hermaphrodite" or "hybrid". The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the left) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 10). Amino acids exist as zwitterions also in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.

The variation in titration curves when the amino acids can be grouped by category. With the exception of tyrosine, using titration to distinguish among hydrophobic amino acids is problematic.

At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in <a href="dynamic%20equilibrium">dynamic equilibrium</a> with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH is known as the <a href="isoelectric%20point">isoelectric point</a> pI, so pI = ½(pKa + pKa). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa + pKa), where pKa is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKa = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKa + pKa). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.

Amino acids are the structural units (monomers) that make up proteins. They join together to form short <a href="polymer">polymer</a> chains called <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s or longer chains called either <a href="polypeptides">polypeptides</a> or <a href="protein">protein</a>s. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called "<a href="translation%20%28biology%29">translation</a>" and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a <a href="ribozyme">ribozyme</a> that is called a <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> from an <a href="Messenger%20RNA">mRNA</a> template, which is a <a href="RNA">RNA</a> copy of one of the organism's <a href="gene">gene</a>s.

Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called <a href="proteinogenic">proteinogenic</a> or natural amino acids. Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a>. The remaining 2, <a href="selenocysteine">selenocysteine</a> and <a href="pyrrolysine">pyrrolysine</a>, are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms. <a href="Selenocysteine">Selenocysteine</a> is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a <a href="SECIS%20element">SECIS element</a>, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a <a href="stop%20codon">stop codon</a>. <a href="Pyrrolysine">Pyrrolysine</a> is used by some <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a>ic <a href="archaea">archaea</a> in enzymes that they use to produce <a href="methane">methane</a>. It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms. This UAG codon is followed by a <a href="PYLIS%20downstream%20sequence">PYLIS downstream sequence</a>.

Aside from the 22 <a href="proteinogenic%20amino%20acid">proteinogenic amino acid</a>s, many "non-proteinogenic" amino acids are known. Those either are not found in proteins (for example <a href="carnitine">carnitine</a>, <a href="Gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">GABA</a>, <a href="Levothyroxine">Levothyroxine</a>) or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, <a href="hydroxyproline">hydroxyproline</a> and <a href="selenomethionine">selenomethionine</a>).

Non-proteinogenic amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by <a href="post-translational%20modification">post-translational modification</a>, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein. For example, the <a href="carboxylation">carboxylation</a> of <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> allows for better binding of <a href="calcium%20in%20biology">calcium cations</a>, and <a href="collagen">collagen</a> contains hydroxyproline, generated by <a href="hydroxylation">hydroxylation</a> of <a href="proline">proline</a>. Another example is the formation of <a href="hypusine">hypusine</a> in the <a href="Eukaryotic%20initiation%20factor">translation initiation factor</a> <a href="EIF5A">EIF5A</a>, through modification of a lysine residue. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a> membrane.

Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include <a href="2-aminoisobutyric%20acid">2-aminoisobutyric acid</a> and the neurotransmitter <a href="gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">gamma-aminobutyric acid</a>. Non-proteinogenic amino acids often occur as intermediates in the <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s for standard amino acids – for example, <a href="ornithine">ornithine</a> and <a href="citrulline">citrulline</a> occur in the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a>, part of amino acid <a href="catabolism">catabolism</a> (see below). A rare exception to the dominance of α-amino acids in biology is the β-amino acid <a href="beta%20alanine">beta alanine</a> (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of <a href="pantothenic%20acid">pantothenic acid</a> (vitamin B), a component of <a href="coenzyme%20A">coenzyme A</a>.

-isomers are uncommon in live organisms. For instance, <a href="gramicidin">gramicidin</a> is a polypeptide made up from mixture of - and -amino acids. Other compounds containing <a href="D-amino%20acids">-amino acid</a> are <a href="tyrocidine">tyrocidine</a> and <a href="valinomycin">valinomycin</a>. These compounds disrupt bacterial cell walls, particularly in <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> bacteria. Only 837 -amino acids were found in Swiss-Prot database (187 million amino acids analysed).

The 20 amino acids that are encoded directly by the codons of the universal <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> are called "standard" or "canonical" amino acids. A modified form of methionine (<a href="N-Formylmethionine">"N"-formylmethionine</a>) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called "non-standard" or "non-canonical". Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but two of them are proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.

The two non-standard proteinogenic amino acids are <a href="selenocysteine">selenocysteine</a> (present in many non-eukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and <a href="pyrrolysine">pyrrolysine</a> (found only in some <a href="archaea">archaea</a> and one <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic <a href="moiety%20%28chemistry%29">moiety</a> in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded by <a href="stop%20codon">stop codon</a> and <a href="SECIS%20element">SECIS element</a>.

When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 20 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to <a href="urea">urea</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a>; the amino group is then fed into the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a>. The other product of transamidation is a <a href="keto%20acid">keto acid</a> that enters the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>. <a href="Glucogenic%20amino%20acid">Glucogenic amino acid</a>s can also be converted into glucose, through <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a>. Of the 20 standard amino acids, nine (<a href="Histidine">His</a>, <a href="Isoleucine">Ile</a>, <a href="Leucine">Leu</a>, <a href="Lysine">Lys</a>, <a href="Methionine">Met</a>, <a href="Phenylalanine">Phe</a>, <a href="Threonine">Thr</a>, <a href="Tryptophan">Trp</a> and <a href="Valine">Val</a>) are called <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s because the <a href="human%20body">human body</a> cannot <a href="biosynthesis">synthesize</a> them from other <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a> at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food. In addition, <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>, <a href="taurine">taurine</a>, <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>, and <a href="arginine">arginine</a> are considered semiessential amino-acids in children (though taurine is not technically an amino acid), because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed. The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids. Dietary exposure to the non-standard amino acid <a href="beta-Methylamino-L-alanine">BMAA</a> has been linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including <a href="ALS">ALS</a>.
In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as <a href="metabolic%20intermediate">metabolic intermediate</a>s, such as in the biosynthesis of the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="gamma-amino-butyric%20acid">gamma-amino-butyric acid</a> (GABA). Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:

Some non-standard amino acids are used as <a href="Plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory">defenses against herbivores</a> in plants. For example, <a href="canavanine">canavanine</a> is an analogue of <a href="arginine">arginine</a> that is found in many <a href="legume">legume</a>s, and in particularly large amounts in "<a href="Canavalia%20gladiata">Canavalia gladiata</a>" (sword bean). This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid <a href="mimosine">mimosine</a> is found in other species of legume, in particular "<a href="Leucaena%20leucocephala">Leucaena leucocephala</a>". This compound is an analogue of <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a> and can poison animals that graze on these plants.

Amino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives to <a href="Compound%20feed">animal feed</a>. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as <a href="soybean">soybean</a>s, either have low levels or lack some of the <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.

The <a href="food%20industry">food industry</a> is also a major consumer of amino acids, in particular, <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a>, which is used as a <a href="flavor%20enhancer">flavor enhancer</a>, and <a href="aspartame">aspartame</a> (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie <a href="artificial%20sweetener">artificial sweetener</a>. Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.

The chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants. The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">drugs</a> and <a href="cosmetics">cosmetics</a>.

Similarly, some amino acids derivatives are used in pharmaceutical industry. They include <a href="5-HTP">5-HTP</a> (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, <a href="L-DOPA">-DOPA</a> (-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for <a href="Parkinson%27s">Parkinson's</a> treatment, and <a href="eflornithine">eflornithine</a> drug that inhibits <a href="ornithine%20decarboxylase">ornithine decarboxylase</a> and used in the treatment of <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a>.

Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a> and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.

Nullomers are codons that in theory code for an amino acid, however in nature there is a selective bias against using this codon in favor of another, for example bacteria prefer to use CGA instead of AGA to code for arginine. This creates some sequences that do not appear in the genome. This characteristic can be taken advantage of and used to create new selective cancer-fighting drugs and to prevent cross-contamination of DNA samples from crime-scene investigations.

Amino acids are important as low-cost <a href="feedstock">feedstock</a>s. These compounds are used in <a href="chiral%20pool%20synthesis">chiral pool synthesis</a> as <a href="enantiomer">enantiomerically pure</a> building-blocks.

Amino acids have been investigated as precursors <a href="chiral%20catalyst">chiral catalyst</a>s, e.g., for asymmetric <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> reactions, although no commercial applications exist.

Amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as <a href="environmentally%20friendly">environmentally friendly</a> packaging and in medicine in <a href="drug%20delivery">drug delivery</a> and the construction of <a href="prosthesis">prosthetic implants</a>. These polymers include polypeptides, <a href="polyamide">polyamide</a>s, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is <a href="Sodium%20poly%28aspartate%29">polyaspartate</a>, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable <a href="diaper">diaper</a>s and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to <a href="chelation">chelate</a> metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-<a href="Fouling">scaling</a> agent and a <a href="corrosion%20inhibitor">corrosion inhibitor</a>. In addition, the aromatic amino acid <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a> is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic <a href="phenols">phenols</a> such as <a href="bisphenol%20A">bisphenol A</a> in the manufacture of <a href="polycarbonate">polycarbonate</a>s.

As amino acids have both a primary <a href="amine">amine</a> group and a primary <a href="carboxyl">carboxyl</a> group, these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups. These include <a href="nucleophilic%20addition">nucleophilic addition</a>, <a href="amide">amide bond</a> formation, and <a href="Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution">imine formation</a> for the amine group, and <a href="esterification">esterification</a>, <a href="amide">amide bond</a> formation, and <a href="decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a> for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.
The multiple side chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.

Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods begins with the <a href="Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky%20halogenation">bromination</a> at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the <a href="Strecker%20amino%20acid%20synthesis">Strecker amino acid synthesis</a> involves the treatment of an aldehyde with <a href="potassium%20cyanide">potassium cyanide</a> and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives <a href="racemic%20mixture">racemic mixture</a>s of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.

At the current time, the most-adopted method is an <a href="automated">automated</a> synthesis on a solid support (e.g., <a href="polystyrene">polystyrene</a> beads), using <a href="protecting%20group">protecting group</a>s (e.g., <a href="Fmoc%20chloride">Fmoc</a> and <a href="Tert-butyloxycarbonyl%20protecting%20group">t-Boc</a>) and activating groups (e.g., <a href="dicyclohexylcarbodiimide">DCC</a> and <a href="diisopropylcarbodiimide">DIC</a>).

As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> of amino acids is what creates proteins. This <a href="condensation%20reaction">condensation reaction</a> yields the newly formed <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a> and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> molecule through an <a href="ester">ester</a> bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>-dependent reaction carried out by an <a href="aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a>. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.

However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a> is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, <a href="gamma-glutamylcysteine%20synthetase">gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase</a> condenses <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a> and <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a> through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with <a href="glycine">glycine</a> by <a href="glutathione%20synthetase">glutathione synthetase</a> to form glutathione.

In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in <a href="peptide%20synthesis">solid-phase peptide synthesis</a> uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support. The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using <a href="combinatorial%20chemistry">combinatorial chemistry</a>) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through <a href="high-throughput%20screening">high-throughput screening</a>.

In plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a>s to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.

Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, <a href="homocysteine">homocysteine</a> is formed through the <a href="transsulfuration%20pathway">transsulfuration pathway</a> or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite <a href="S-adenosyl%20methionine">S-adenosyl methionine</a>, while <a href="hydroxyproline">hydroxyproline</a> is made by a <a href="posttranslational%20modification">posttranslational modification</a> of <a href="proline">proline</a>.

<a href="Microorganism">Microorganism</a>s and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make <a href="2-aminoisobutyric%20acid">2-aminoisobutyric acid</a> and <a href="lanthionine">lanthionine</a>, which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine. Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic <a href="lantibiotics">lantibiotics</a> such as <a href="alamethicin">alamethicin</a>. However, in plants, <a href="1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic%20acid">1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid</a> is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone <a href="ethylene%23Ethylene%20as%20a%20plant%20hormone">ethylene</a>.

Amino acids must first pass out of organelles and cells into blood circulation via <a href="amino%20acid%20transporter">amino acid transporter</a>s, since the amine and carboxylic acid groups are typically ionized. Degradation of an amino acid, occurring in the liver and kidneys, often involves <a href="deamination">deamination</a> by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a> and is excreted in the form of <a href="urea">urea</a>. However, amino acid degradation can produce <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> or ammonia instead. For example, <a href="serine%20dehydratase">serine dehydratase</a> converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> or the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>, as detailed in image at right.

The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, <a href="hydrophile">hydrophilicity</a> or <a href="hydrophobe">hydrophobicity</a>, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a> and <a href="protein%E2%80%93protein%20interaction">protein–protein interaction</a>s. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, a residue refers to a specific <a href="monomer">monomer</a> within the <a href="polymer">polymeric chain</a> of a <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>, <a href="protein">protein</a> or <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>.) The <a href="integral%20membrane%20protein">integral membrane protein</a>s tend to have outer rings of exposed <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> amino acids that anchor them into the <a href="lipid%20bilayer">lipid bilayer</a>. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some <a href="peripheral%20membrane%20protein">peripheral membrane protein</a>s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> and <a href="aspartate">aspartate</a>, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like <a href="lysine">lysine</a> and <a href="arginine">arginine</a>. There are different <a href="hydrophobicity%20scale">hydrophobicity scale</a>s of amino acid residues.

Some amino acids have special properties such as <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>, that can form covalent <a href="disulfide%20bond">disulfide bond</a>s to other cysteine residues, <a href="proline">proline</a> that forms <a href="cyclic%20compound">a cycle</a> to the polypeptide backbone, and <a href="glycine">glycine</a> that is more flexible than other amino acids.

Many proteins undergo a range of <a href="posttranslational%20modification">posttranslational modification</a>s, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic <a href="lipoprotein">lipoprotein</a>s, or hydrophilic <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a> to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.

Two additional amino acids are in some species coded for by <a href="genetic%20code">codons</a> that are usually interpreted as <a href="stop%20codon">stop codon</a>s:

In addition to the specific amino acid codes, placeholders are used in cases where <a href="Protein%20sequencing">chemical</a> or <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">crystallographic</a> analysis of a peptide or protein cannot conclusively determine the identity of a residue. They are also used to summarise <a href="Conserved%20sequence">conserved protein sequence</a> motifs. The use of single letters to indicate sets of similar residues is similar to the use of <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20notation">abbreviation codes for degenerate bases</a>.

Unk is sometimes used instead of Xaa, but is less standard.

In addition, many <a href="Non-proteinogenic%20amino%20acids">non-standard amino acids</a> have a specific code. For example, several peptide drugs, such as <a href="Bortezomib">Bortezomib</a> and <a href="MG132">MG132</a>, are <a href="peptide%20synthesis">artificially synthesized</a> and retain their <a href="protecting%20group">protecting group</a>s, which have specific codes. Bortezomib is <a href="pyrazinoic%20acid">Pyz</a>-Phe-boroLeu, and MG132 is <a href="Carboxybenzyl">Z</a>-Leu-Leu-Leu-al. To aid in the analysis of protein structure, <a href="photo-reactive%20amino%20acid%20analog">photo-reactive amino acid analog</a>s are available. These include <a href="photoleucine">photoleucine</a> (pLeu) and <a href="photomethionine">photomethionine</a> (pMet).

Alan Turing

Alan Mathison Turing (; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English <a href="computer%20scientist">computer scientist</a>, <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, <a href="logic">logic</a>ian, <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalyst</a>, <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> and <a href="mathematical%20and%20theoretical%20biology">theoretical biologist</a>.

Turing was highly influential in the development of <a href="theoretical%20computer%20science">theoretical computer science</a>, providing a formalisation of the concepts of <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> and <a href="computation">computation</a> with the <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>, which can be considered a model of a <a href="general%20purpose%20computer">general purpose computer</a>. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Turing worked for the <a href="Government%20Communications%20Headquarters%23Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School%20%28GC%26amp%3BCS%29">Government Code and Cypher School</a> (GC&CS) at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>, Britain's <a href="cryptanalysis">codebreaking</a> centre that produced <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> intelligence. For a time he led <a href="Hut%208">Hut 8</a>, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German <a href="cipher">cipher</a>s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish <a href="Bomba%20%28cryptography%29">bombe</a> method, an <a href="electromechanics">electromechanical</a> machine that could find settings for the <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma machine</a>. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, and in so doing helped win the war. <a href="Counterfactual%20history">Counterfactual history</a> is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.

After the war, Turing worked at the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%2C%20UK">National Physical Laboratory</a>, where he designed the <a href="Automatic%20Computing%20Engine">ACE</a>, among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>'s <a href="Computing%20Machine%20Laboratory">Computing Machine Laboratory</a> at the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a>, where he helped develop the <a href="Manchester%20computers">Manchester computers</a> and became interested in <a href="mathematical%20biology">mathematical biology</a>. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of <a href="morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a>, and predicted <a href="Chemical%20clock">oscillating</a> <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s such as the <a href="Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky%20reaction">Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction</a>, first observed in the 1960s.

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the <a href="Labouchere%20Amendment">Labouchere Amendment</a>, "gross indecency" was criminal in the UK. He accepted <a href="chemical%20castration">chemical castration</a> treatment, with <a href="Diethylstilbestrol">DES</a>, as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a>. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an <a href="Internet%20activism">Internet campaign</a>, British Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> made an <a href="%23Government%20apology%20and%20pardon%20support">official public apology</a> on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. The <a href="Alan%20Turing%20law">Alan Turing law</a> is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.

Turing was born in <a href="Maida%20Vale">Maida Vale</a>, London, while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Service">Indian Civil Service</a> (ICS) at <a href="Chhatrapur">Chhatrapur</a>, Bihar and Orissa Province, in <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a <a href="baronet">baronet</a>. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the <a href="Madras%20and%20Southern%20Mahratta%20Railway">Madras Railways</a>. The Stoneys were a <a href="Protestantism%20in%20Ireland">Protestant</a> <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> <a href="gentry">gentry</a> family from both <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a> and <a href="County%20Longford">County Longford</a>, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in <a href="County%20Clare">County Clare</a>.

Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the <a href="Bengal%20Army">Bengal Army</a>. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to <a href="Maida%20Vale">Maida Vale</a>, London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> on the outside of the house of his birth, later the <a href="Colonnade%20Hotel%20%28London%29">Colonnade Hotel</a>. He had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the <a href="Turing%20baronets">Turing baronets</a>).

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between <a href="Hastings">Hastings</a> in England and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, <a href="St%20Leonards-on-Sea">St Leonards-on-Sea</a>, now marked with a blue plaque. The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's birth.

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. His parents purchased a house in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a> in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.

Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, <a href="St%20Leonards-on-Sea">St Leonards-on-Sea</a>, at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.

Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of <a href="Frant">Frant</a> in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> (now <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>). In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to <a href="Sherborne%20School">Sherborne School</a>, a boarding independent school in the <a href="market%20town">market town</a> of <a href="Sherborne">Sherborne</a> in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the <a href="1926%20United%20Kingdom%20general%20strike">1926 General Strike</a> in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the <a href="classics">classics</a>. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming "educated". If he is to be solely a "Scientific Specialist", he is wasting his time at a public school". Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary <a href="calculus">calculus</a>. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion">Newton's laws of motion</a> from a text in which this was never made explicit.

At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's "first love". Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of <a href="bovine%20tuberculosis">bovine tuberculosis</a>, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.

Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's <a href="atheism">atheism</a> and <a href="materialism">materialism</a>. Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.

After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, where he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a <a href="fellow">fellow</a> of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the <a href="central%20limit%20theorem">central limit theorem</a>. Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by <a href="Jarl%20Waldemar%20Lindeberg">Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg</a>.

In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the "Entscheidungsproblem"" (1936). In this paper, Turing reformulated <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>s. The "<a href="Entscheidungsproblem">Entscheidungsproblem</a>" (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the "decision problem" by first showing that the <a href="halting%20problem">halting problem</a> for Turing machines is <a href="Decision%20problem">undecidable</a>: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.
Although Turing's proof was published shortly after <a href="Alonzo%20Church">Alonzo Church</a>'s equivalent proof using his <a href="lambda%20calculus">lambda calculus</a>, Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's. It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a <a href="universal%20Turing%20machine">universal Turing machine</a>), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the <a href="Church%E2%80%93Turing%20thesis">Church–Turing thesis</a>, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper. To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in <a href="theory%20of%20computation">theory of computation</a>.

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton; his dissertation, "<a href="Systems%20of%20Logic%20Based%20on%20Ordinals">Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals</a>", introduced the concept of <a href="ordinal%20logic">ordinal logic</a> and the notion of <a href="Turing%20reduction">relative computing</a>, where Turing machines are augmented with so-called <a href="oracle%20machine">oracles</a>, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> wanted to hire him as his <a href="Postdoctoral%20researcher">postdoctoral assistant</a>, but he went back to England.

When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> about the <a href="foundations%20of%20mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a>. Remarkably, the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes. Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending <a href="Philosophy%20of%20mathematics%23Formalism">formalism</a> and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.

During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>. The historian and wartime codebreaker <a href="Asa%20Briggs">Asa Briggs</a> has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."
From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the <a href="Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School%23Government%20Communications%20Headquarters">GC&CS</a>, the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on <a href="cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Enigma">cryptanalysis of the Enigma</a> with <a href="Dilly%20Knox">Dilly Knox</a>, a senior GC&CS codebreaker. Soon after the July 1939 <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> meeting at which the <a href="Polish%20Cipher%20Bureau">Polish Cipher Bureau</a> had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of <a href="Enigma%20rotor%20details">Enigma rotors</a> and their method of decrypting <a href="Enigma%20code">Enigma code</a> messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure <a href="Cryptanalysis%23Indicator">indicator</a> procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using <a href="Cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Enigma%23Crib-based%20decryption">crib-based decryption</a> for which he produced the functional specification of the <a href="bombe">bombe</a> (an improvement of the Polish <a href="Bomba%20%28cryptography%29">Bomba</a>).

On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed "<a href="Banburismus">Banburismus</a>"; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the <a href="Lorenz%20SZ%2040/42">Lorenz SZ 40/42</a> ("Tunny") dubbed "<a href="Turingery">Turingery</a>" and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable <a href="secure%20voice">secure voice</a> scrambler at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government%20Communications%20Centre">Hanslope Park</a> that was codenamed "Delilah".

By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled "The Applications of Probability to Cryptography" and "Paper on Statistics of Repetitions", which were of such value to GC&CS and its successor <a href="Government%20Communications%20Headquarters">GCHQ</a> that they were not released to the <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">UK National Archives</a> until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, "who identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis: 

Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma was known as 'The Prof's pageRank.Book'. <a href="I.J.%20Good">Jack Good</a>, a cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by <a href="Ronald%20Lewin">Ronald Lewin</a> as having said of Turing:

While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high-level meetings, and he was capable of world-class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.

In 1946, Turing was appointed an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) by King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.

Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park, Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish "<a href="bomba%20%28cryptography%29">bomba kryptologiczna</a>", from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician <a href="Gordon%20Welchman">Gordon Welchman</a>, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.

Jack Good opined:
The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable "<a href="crib%20%28cryptanalysis%29">crib</a>": a fragment of probable <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a>. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10 states, or 10 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant), the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented <a href="Electromechanics">electromechanically</a>.

The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter—this simply wasn't possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, <a href="Conel%20Hugh%20O%27Donel%20Alexander">Hugh Alexander</a>, and <a href="Stuart%20Milner-Barry">Stuart Milner-Barry</a> were frustrated. Building on the <a href="Biuro%20Szyfr%C3%B3w%23Gift%20to%20allies">work of the Poles</a>, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer, they had had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.

As <a href="Andrew%20Hodges">Andrew Hodges</a>, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect." Churchill wrote a memo to <a href="Hastings%20Ismay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ismay">General Ismay</a>, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry later recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth." More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.

Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of <a href="Cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Enigma%23German%20naval%20Enigma">German naval Enigma</a> "because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself". In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval <a href="Enigma%20machine%23Indicator">indicator</a> system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.

That same night, he also conceived of the idea of "<a href="Banburismus">Banburismus</a>", a sequential statistical technique (what <a href="Abraham%20Wald">Abraham Wald</a> later called <a href="sequential%20analysis">sequential analysis</a>) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken." For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the "<a href="Ban%20%28unit%29">ban</a>". "Banburismus" could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague <a href="Joan%20Clarke">Joan Clarke</a>, a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Computing%20Machine%20Laboratory">Computing Machine Laboratory</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>.

Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:
During this trip, he also assisted at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> with the development of <a href="secure%20speech">secure speech</a> devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, <a href="Colonel%20Hugh%20O%27Donel%20Alexander">Hugh Alexander</a> had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been "de facto" head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Alexander wrote this about Turing's contribution:
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed "<a href="Turingery">Turingery</a>" (or jokingly "Turingismus") for use against the <a href="Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz cipher</a> messages produced by the Germans' new "Geheimschreiber" (secret writer) machine. This was a <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> <a href="Rotor%20machine">rotor cipher attachment</a> codenamed "Tunny" at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of "wheel-breaking", i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to <a href="Tommy%20Flowers">Tommy Flowers</a> who, under the guidance of <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>, went on to build the <a href="Colossus%20computer">Colossus computer</a>, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the <a href="Heath%20Robinson%20%28codebreaking%20machine%29">Heath Robinson</a>), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about <a href="cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Lorenz%20cipher">cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher</a>, but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.

Following his work at Bell Labs in the US, Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and in the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government%20Communications%20Centre">HMGCC</a>) at <a href="Hanslope%20Park">Hanslope Park</a>. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable <a href="secure%20voice">secure voice</a> communications machine codenamed "Delilah". It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> speech, Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of <a href="SIGSALY">SIGSALY</a>, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in <a href="Hampton%2C%20London">Hampton</a>, London, while he worked on the design of the <a href="ACE%20%28computer%29">ACE</a> (Automatic Computing Engine) at the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%2C%20UK">National Physical Laboratory (NPL)</a>. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a <a href="stored-program%20computer">stored-program computer</a>. <a href="Von%20Neumann">Von Neumann</a>'s incomplete "<a href="First%20Draft%20of%20a%20Report%20on%20the%20EDVAC">First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC</a>" had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to <a href="John%20R.%20Womersley">John R. Womersley</a>, Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own". Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on "Intelligent Machinery" that was not published in his lifetime. While he was at Cambridge, the <a href="Pilot%20ACE">Pilot ACE</a> was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the <a href="English%20Electric%20DEUCE">English Electric DEUCE</a> and the American <a href="Bendix%20G-15">Bendix G-15</a>. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer <a href="Heinz%20Billing">Heinz Billing</a> from the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Physics">Max Planck Institute for Physics</a>, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and <a href="Konrad%20Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>. It took place in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were <a href="John%20R.%20Womersley">Womersley</a>, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, "Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz").

In 1948 Turing was appointed <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">Reader</a> in the <a href="School%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20University%20of%20Manchester">Mathematics Department</a> at the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a>. In 1949, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there, working on software for one of the earliest <a href="Von%20Neumann%20architecture">stored-program</a> computers—the <a href="Manchester%20Mark%201">Manchester Mark 1</a>. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,<ref name="doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287"></ref> and in "<a href="Computing%20Machinery%20and%20Intelligence">Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>" ("<a href="Mind%20%28journal%29">Mind</a>", October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, and proposed an experiment that became known as the <a href="Turing%20test">Turing test</a>, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A <a href="Turing%20test%23Reverse%20Turing%20test%20and%20CAPTCHA">reversed</a> form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the <a href="CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, <a href="D.%20G.%20Champernowne">D. G. Champernowne</a>, began writing a <a href="chess">chess</a> program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952, he tried to implement it on a <a href="Ferranti%20Mark%201">Ferranti Mark 1</a>, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. The program lost to Turing's colleague <a href="Alick%20Glennie">Alick Glennie</a>, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.

His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the <a href="LU%20decomposition">LU decomposition</a> method in 1948, used today for solving matrix equations.

In 1951, when Turing was 39 years old, he turned to <a href="Mathematical%20and%20theoretical%20biology">mathematical biology</a>, finally publishing his masterpiece "<a href="The%20Chemical%20Basis%20of%20Morphogenesis">The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis</a>" in January 1952. He was interested in <a href="morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a>, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things, he wanted to understand Fibonacci <a href="phyllotaxis">phyllotaxis</a>, the existence of <a href="Fibonacci%20numbers">Fibonacci numbers</a> in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a <a href="reaction-diffusion%20system">reaction-diffusion system</a>, could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis". He used systems of <a href="partial%20differential%20equations">partial differential equations</a> to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is <a href="autocatalytic">autocatalytic</a>, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist <a href="Boris%20Pavlovich%20Belousov">Boris Belousov</a> had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the <a href="second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law, see <a href="Second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics%23Living%20organisms">Second law of thermodynamics#Living organisms</a>. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing's paper in the "<a href="Philosophical%20Transactions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a>".

Although published before the structure and role of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> was understood, Turing's work on morphogenesis remains relevant today, and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small. Further research in the area suggests that Turing's work can partially explain the growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest." In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism. Later papers were not available until "Collected Works of A. M. Turing" was published in 1992.

In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the <a href="Dancehouse">Regal Cinema</a> when walking down Manchester's <a href="Wilmslow%20Road">Oxford Road</a> and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with <a href="gross%20indecency%20%28criminal%20offence%29">gross indecency</a> under <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201885%23Section%2011">Section 11</a> of the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201885">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a>. Initial <a href="committal%20procedure">committal proceedings</a> for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case, "<a href="Elizabeth%20II">Regina</a> v. Turing and Murray," was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo <a href="hormone">hormonal</a> treatment designed to reduce <a href="libido">libido</a>. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as <a href="diethylstilbestrol">diethylstilbestrol</a> or DES), a synthetic <a href="oestrogen">oestrogen</a>; this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing <a href="impotence">impotent</a> and caused <a href="gynaecomastia">gynaecomastia</a>, fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out". Murray was given a conditional discharge.

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the <a href="Government%20Communications%20Headquarters">Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)</a>, the British <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946 (though he kept his academic job). He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage, but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a> from discussing his war work.

Alan Turing is credited with designing the first computer chess program in 1953. Turing first worked on the algorithm in 1948 The program did not run on a computer; Turing "ran" the program by flipping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a chessboard. According to <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess."

On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A <a href="post-mortem">post-mortem</a> examination established that the cause of death was <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a>. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at <a href="Woking%20Crematorium">Woking Crematorium</a> on 12 June 1954. Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, <a href="David%20Leavitt">David Leavitt</a>, have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> film "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew."

Philosophy professor <a href="Jack%20Copeland">Jack Copeland</a> has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for <a href="electroplating">electroplating</a> gold onto spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to <a href="Gold%23Commercial%20chemistry">dissolve the gold</a>. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, even setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend. Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals. Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests Turing arranged the delivery of the equipment to deliberately allow his mother <a href="plausible%20deniability">plausible deniability</a> regarding any suicide claims.
A biography published by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> shortly after Turing's death, while his wartime work was still subject to the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a>, recorded:

Since 1966, the <a href="Turing%20Award">Turing Award</a> has been given annually by the <a href="Association%20for%20Computing%20Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

On 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, his biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Hodges">Andrew Hodges</a>, unveiled an official <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> at his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade Hotel. To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence, Hollymeade, in <a href="Wilmslow">Wilmslow</a>, Cheshire.

On 13 March 2000, <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: "1937: Alan Turing's theory of digital computing". On 1 April 2003, Turing's work at <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a> was named an <a href="List%20of%20IEEE%20milestones">IEEE Milestone</a>. On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by <a href="John%20W.%20Mills">John W. Mills</a> was unveiled at the <a href="University%20of%20Surrey">University of Surrey</a> in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, marking the 50th anniversary of Turing's death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.

Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled "Dangerous Knowledge" (2008). The "<a href="Princeton%20Alumni%20Weekly">Princeton Alumni Weekly</a>" named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, second only to President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh <a href="slate">slate</a>, it was sculpted by <a href="Stephen%20Kettle">Stephen Kettle</a>, having been commissioned by the American billionaire <a href="Sidney%20Frank">Sidney Frank</a>.

Turing has been honoured in various ways in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the <a href="A6010%20road">A6010 road</a> (the <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> city intermediate ring road) was named "Alan Turing Way". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A <a href="Alan%20Turing%20Memorial">statue of Turing</a> was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in <a href="Sackville%20Park">Sackville Park</a>, between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and <a href="Canal%20Street%2C%20Manchester">Canal Street</a>. The memorial statue depicts the "father of computer science" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma machine</a>: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.

A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> quotation: "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture." The sculptor buried his own old <a href="Amstrad">Amstrad</a> computer under the <a href="plinth">plinth</a> as a tribute to "the godfather of all modern computers".

In 1999, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named Turing as one of the and stated, "The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine."

In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC's poll of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a> following a UK-wide vote. In 2006, British writer and mathematician <a href="Ioan%20James">Ioan James</a> chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>. In 2010, actor/playwright <a href="Jade%20Esteban%20Estrada">Jade Esteban Estrada</a> portrayed Turing in the solo musical, "ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 4". In 2011, in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s "My hero" series, writer <a href="Alan%20Garner">Alan Garner</a> chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met while out jogging in the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as "funny and witty" and said that he "talked endlessly". In 2006, Alan Turing was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month Icon. In 2006, Boston <a href="GLBT%20pride">Pride</a> named Turing their Honorary Grand Marshal.

The logo of <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his death. Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design. <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a> has recounted asking <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> whether the design was intentional, saying that Jobs' response was, "God, we wish it were." In February 2011, Turing's papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation with an 11th-hour bid by the <a href="National%20Heritage%20Memorial%20Fund">National Heritage Memorial Fund</a>, allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.

In 2012, Turing was inducted into the <a href="Legacy%20Walk">Legacy Walk</a>, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.

The francophone singer-songwriter <a href="Salvatore%20Adamo">Salvatore Adamo</a> made a tribute to Turing with his song "Alan et la Pomme". Turing's life and work featured in a BBC children's programme about famous scientists—"<a href="Absolute%20Genius%20with%20Dick%20and%20Dom">Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom</a>"—first broadcast on 12 March 2014.

On 17 May 2014, the world's first work of public art to recognise Alan Turing as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park where his war-time work was carried out. The commission was announced by the owners of <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>-based LGBT venue and nightclub Pink Punters to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.
The work was unveiled at a ceremony on Turing's birthday, 23 June 2014, and is placed outside Pink Punter's alongside the busy Watling Street, the old main road to London, where Turing himself would have passed by on many occasions. On 22 October 2014, Turing was inducted into the <a href="NSA%20Hall%20of%20Honor">NSA Hall of Honor</a>.



In August 2009, <a href="John%20Graham-Cumming">John Graham-Cumming</a> started a petition urging the British Government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual. The petition received more than 30,000 signatures. Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling":

In December 2011, William Jones created an <a href="e-petition">e-petition</a> requesting the British Government <a href="pardon">pardon</a> Turing for his conviction of "gross indecency":
The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures, but the request was discouraged by <a href="Tom%20McNally%2C%20Baron%20McNally%23Political%20career">Lord McNally</a>, who gave the following opinion in his role as the Justice Minister:
<a href="John%20Leech%20%28politician%29">John Leech</a>, the MP for <a href="Manchester%20Withington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Manchester Withington</a> (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament and campaigned with William Jones to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was "ultimately just embarrassing" that the conviction still stood. Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed.

On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952. Late in the year in a letter to "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", the physicist <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> and 10 other signatories including the <a href="Astronomer%20Royal">Astronomer Royal</a> <a href="Martin%20Rees%2C%20Baron%20Rees%20of%20Ludlow">Lord Rees</a>, <a href="List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">President of the Royal Society</a> Sir <a href="Paul%20Nurse">Paul Nurse</a>, <a href="Jean%20Barker%2C%20Baroness%20Trumpington">Lady Trumpington</a> (who worked for Turing during the war) and <a href="John%20Sharkey%2C%20Baron%20Sharkey">Lord Sharkey</a> (the bill's sponsor) called on Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> to act on the pardon request. The Government indicated it would support the bill, and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October.

Before the bill could be debated in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, the Government elected to proceed under the <a href="royal%20prerogative%20of%20mercy">royal prerogative of mercy</a>. On 24 December 2013, <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for gross indecency, with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon, Justice Secretary <a href="Chris%20Grayling">Chris Grayling</a> said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction. The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014. The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War. This case is unusual in that pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party. Neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.

In a letter to Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> after announcement of the pardon, human rights advocate <a href="Peter%20Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements, when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons. Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing's death:

In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an "<a href="Alan%20Turing%20law">Alan Turing law</a>". The <a href="Alan%20Turing%20law">Alan Turing law</a> is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained in the <a href="Policing%20and%20Crime%20Act%202017">Policing and Crime Act 2017</a>, which serves as an <a href="amnesty%20law">amnesty law</a> to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales.

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the <a href="Alan%20Turing%20Year">Alan Turing Year</a>, a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by <a href="S.%20Barry%20Cooper">S. Barry Cooper</a> with Alan Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President, worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and <a href="Bletchley%20Park">Bletchley Park</a>.

On 23 June 2012, Google featured an interactive <a href="Google%20doodle%23Google%20Doodle">doodle</a> where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring "Google" in <a href="ITA2">Baudot-Murray code</a>.

The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with <a href="Winning%20Moves">Winning Moves</a> to publish an Alan Turing edition of the board game <a href="Monopoly%20%28game%29">Monopoly</a>. The game's squares and cards have been revised to tell the story of Alan Turing's life, from his birthplace in Maida Vale to Hut 8 at Bletchley Park. The game also includes a replica of an original hand-drawn board created by <a href="William%20Newman%20%28computer%20scientist%29">William Newman</a>, son of Turing's mentor, <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>, which Turing played on in the 1950s.

In the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the <a href="De%20La%20Salle%20University%20College%20of%20Liberal%20Arts%23Academic%20departments%20of%20CLA">Department of Philosophy</a> at <a href="De%20La%20Salle%20University">De La Salle University-Manila</a> hosted Turing 2012, an international conference on philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science from 27 to 28 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary birth of Turing. <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>, India held celebrations with a programme attended by 6,000 students.

There was a three-day conference in Manchester in June, a two-day conference in San Francisco, organised by the ACM, and a birthday party and Turing Centenary Conference in Cambridge organised at <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, and the University of Cambridge, the latter organised by the association <a href="Computability%20in%20Europe">Computability in Europe</a>.

The <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum in London</a> launched a free exhibition devoted to Turing's life and achievements in June 2012, to run until July 2013. In February 2012, the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> issued a stamp featuring Turing as part of its "Britons of Distinction" series. The <a href="London%202012">London 2012</a> <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics%20torch%20relay">Olympic Torch</a> flame was passed on in front of Turing's statue in <a href="Sackville%20Gardens">Sackville Gardens</a>, Manchester, on the evening of 23 June 2012, the 100th anniversary of his birth.

On 22 June 2012 <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester City Council</a>, in partnership with the <a href="The%20Lesbian%20and%20Gay%20Foundation%20in%20Manchester">Lesbian and Gay Foundation</a>, launched the Alan Turing Memorial Award, which will recognise individuals or groups who have made a significant contribution to the fight against homophobia in Manchester.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, a new course in <a href="Computer%20Science">Computer Science</a> and Philosophy was established to coincide with the centenary of Turing's birth.

Previous events have included a celebration of Turing's life and achievements, at the University of Manchester, arranged by the British Logic Colloquium and the <a href="British%20Society%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Mathematics">British Society for the History of Mathematics</a> on 5 June 2004.

Area

Area is the <a href="quantity">quantity</a> that expresses the extent of a <a href="two-dimensional">two-dimensional</a> figure or <a href="shape">shape</a>, or <a href="planar%20lamina">planar lamina</a>, in the <a href="Plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a>. <a href="Surface%20area">Surface area</a> is its analog on the two-dimensional <a href="Surface%20%28topology%29">surface</a> of a <a href="solid%20geometry">three-dimensional object</a>. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of <a href="paint">paint</a> necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the <a href="length">length</a> of a <a href="plane%20curve">curve</a> (a one-dimensional concept) or the <a href="volume">volume</a> of a solid (a three-dimensional concept).

The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to <a href="square">square</a>s of a fixed size. In the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI), the standard unit of area is the <a href="square%20metre">square metre</a> (written as m), which is the area of a square whose sides are one <a href="metre">metre</a> long. A shape with an area of three square metres would have the same area as three such squares. In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the <a href="unit%20square">unit square</a> is defined to have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a <a href="Dimensionless%20quantity">dimensionless</a> <a href="real%20number">real number</a>.

There are several well-known <a href="formula">formula</a>s for the areas of simple shapes such as <a href="triangle">triangle</a>s, <a href="rectangle">rectangle</a>s, and <a href="circle">circle</a>s. Using these formulas, the area of any <a href="polygon">polygon</a> can be found by <a href="Polygon%20triangulation">dividing the polygon into triangles</a>. For shapes with curved boundary, <a href="calculus">calculus</a> is usually required to compute the area. Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the <a href="History%20of%20calculus">historical development of calculus</a>.

For a solid shape such as a <a href="sphere">sphere</a>, cone, or cylinder, the area of its boundary surface is called the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>. Formulas for the surface areas of simple shapes were computed by the <a href="Greek%20mathematics">ancient Greeks</a>, but computing the surface area of a more complicated shape usually requires <a href="multivariable%20calculus">multivariable calculus</a>.

Area plays an important role in modern mathematics. In addition to its obvious importance in <a href="geometry">geometry</a> and calculus, area is related to the definition of <a href="determinant">determinant</a>s in <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>, and is a basic property of surfaces in <a href="differential%20geometry">differential geometry</a>. In <a href="analysis">analysis</a>, the area of a subset of the plane is defined using <a href="Lebesgue%20measure">Lebesgue measure</a>, though not every subset is measurable. In general, area in higher mathematics is seen as a special case of volume for two-dimensional regions.

Area can be defined through the use of axioms, defining it as a function of a collection of certain plane figures to the set of real numbers. It can be proved that such a function exists.

An approach to defining what is meant by "area" is through <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s. "Area" can be defined as a function from a collection M of special kind of plane figures (termed measurable sets) to the set of real numbers which satisfies the following properties:

It can be proved that such an area function actually exists.

Every <a href="unit%20of%20length">unit of length</a> has a corresponding unit of area, namely the area of a square with the given side length. Thus areas can be measured in <a href="square%20metre">square metre</a>s (m), square centimetres (cm), square millimetres (mm), <a href="square%20kilometre">square kilometre</a>s (km), <a href="square%20foot">square feet</a> (ft), <a href="square%20yard">square yard</a>s (yd), <a href="square%20mile">square mile</a>s (mi), and so forth. Algebraically, these units can be thought of as the <a href="square%20%28algebra%29">squares</a> of the corresponding length units.

The SI unit of area is the square metre, which is considered an <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">SI derived unit</a>.

Calculation of the area of a square whose length and width are 1 metre would be:

1 metre x 1 metre = 1 m

and therefore, another square with different sides can be calculated as:

3 metres x 2 metres = 6 m. This is, however, equivalent to 6 million millimetres square. Following this,

In non-metric units, the conversion between two square units is the <a href="square%20%28algebra%29">square</a> of the conversion between the corresponding length units.
the relationship between square feet and square inches is
where 144 = 12 = 12 × 12. Similarly:
In addition, conversion factors include:

There are several other common units for area. The "<a href="Are%20%28unit%29">Are</a>" was the original unit of area in the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>, with;
Though the are has fallen out of use, the <a href="hectare">hectare</a> is still commonly used to measure land:
Other uncommon metric units of area include the <a href="tetrad%20%28unit%20of%20area%29">tetrad</a>, the <a href="hectad">hectad</a>, and the <a href="Myriad%20%28area%29">myriad</a>.

The <a href="acre">acre</a> is also commonly used to measure land areas, where
An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare.

On the atomic scale, area is measured in units of <a href="Barn%20%28unit%29">barns</a>, such that:
The barn is commonly used in describing the cross sectional area of interaction in <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>.

In India,

In the 5th century BCE, <a href="Hippocrates%20of%20Chios">Hippocrates of Chios</a> was the first to show that the area of a disk (the region enclosed by a circle) is proportional to the square of its diameter, as part of his <a href="Quadrature%20%28mathematics%29">quadrature</a> of the <a href="lune%20of%20Hippocrates">lune of Hippocrates</a>, but did not identify the <a href="constant%20of%20proportionality">constant of proportionality</a>. <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>, also in the 5th century BCE, also found that the area of a disk is proportional to its radius squared.

Subsequently, pageRank.Book I of <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's "Elements"</a> dealt with equality of areas between two-dimensional figures. The mathematician <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> used the tools of <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a> to show that the area inside a circle is equal to that of a <a href="right%20triangle">right triangle</a> whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius, in his book "<a href="Measurement%20of%20a%20Circle">Measurement of a Circle</a>". (The circumference is 2"r", and the area of a triangle is half the base times the height, yielding the area "r" for the disk.) Archimedes approximated the value of π (and hence the area of a unit-radius circle) with <a href="Area%20of%20a%20disk%23Archimedes%27%20doubling%20method">his doubling method</a>, in which he inscribed a regular triangle in a circle and noted its area, then doubled the number of sides to give a regular <a href="hexagon">hexagon</a>, then repeatedly doubled the number of sides as the polygon's area got closer and closer to that of the circle (and did the same with <a href="circumscribed%20polygon">circumscribed polygon</a>s).

Swiss scientist <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a> in 1761 proved that <a href="pi">π</a>, the ratio of a circle's area to its squared radius, is <a href="irrational%20number">irrational</a>, meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers. In 1794 French mathematician <a href="Adrien-Marie%20Legendre">Adrien-Marie Legendre</a> proved that π is irrational; this also proves that π is irrational. In 1882, German mathematician <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Lindemann">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a> proved that π is <a href="transcendental%20number">transcendental</a> (not the solution of any <a href="polynomial%20equation">polynomial equation</a> with rational coefficients), confirming a conjecture made by both <a href="Adrien-Marie%20Legendre">Legendre</a> and Euler.

<a href="Hero%20of%20Alexandria">Heron (or Hero) of Alexandria</a> found what is known as <a href="Heron%27s%20formula">Heron's formula</a> for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides, and a proof can be found in his book, "Metrica", written around 60 CE. It has been suggested that <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> knew the formula over two centuries earlier, and since "Metrica" is a collection of the mathematical knowledge available in the ancient world, it is possible that the formula predates the reference given in that work.

In 499 <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a>, a great <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>-<a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> from the classical age of <a href="Indian%20mathematics">Indian mathematics</a> and <a href="Indian%20astronomy">Indian astronomy</a>, expressed the area of a triangle as one-half the base times the height in the "<a href="Aryabhatiya">Aryabhatiya</a>" (section 2.6).

A formula equivalent to Heron's was discovered by the Chinese independently of the Greeks. It was published in 1247 in "Shushu Jiuzhang" ("<a href="Mathematical%20Treatise%20in%20Nine%20Sections">Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections</a>"), written by <a href="Qin%20Jiushao">Qin Jiushao</a>.

In the 7th century CE, <a href="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a> developed a formula, now known as <a href="Brahmagupta%27s%20formula">Brahmagupta's formula</a>, for the area of a <a href="cyclic%20quadrilateral">cyclic quadrilateral</a> (a <a href="quadrilateral">quadrilateral</a> <a href="inscribed%20figure">inscribed</a> in a circle) in terms of its sides. In 1842 the German mathematicians <a href="Carl%20Anton%20Bretschneider">Carl Anton Bretschneider</a> and <a href="Karl%20Georg%20Christian%20von%20Staudt">Karl Georg Christian von Staudt</a> independently found a formula, known as <a href="Bretschneider%27s%20formula">Bretschneider's formula</a>, for the area of any quadrilateral.

The development of <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">Cartesian coordinates</a> by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> in the 17th century allowed the development of the <a href="Shoelace%20formula">surveyor's formula</a> for the area of any polygon with known <a href="vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertex</a> locations by <a href="Gauss">Gauss</a> in the 19th century.

The development of <a href="integral%20calculus">integral calculus</a> in the late 17th century provided tools that could subsequently be used for computing more complicated areas, such as the area of an <a href="ellipse%23Area">ellipse</a> and the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>s of various curved three-dimensional objects.

For a non-self-intersecting (<a href="simple%20polygon">simple</a>) polygon, the <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">Cartesian coordinates</a> formula_1 ("i"=0, 1, ..., "n"-1) of whose "n" <a href="vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertices</a> are known, the area is given by the <a href="shoelace%20formula">surveyor's formula</a>:

where when "i"="n"-1, then "i"+1 is expressed as <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modulus</a> "n" and so refers to 0.

The most basic area formula is the formula for the area of a <a href="rectangle">rectangle</a>. Given a rectangle with length and width , the formula for the area is:

That is, the area of the rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. As a special case, as in the case of a square, the area of a square with side length is given by the formula:

The formula for the area of a rectangle follows directly from the basic properties of area, and is sometimes taken as a <a href="definition">definition</a> or <a href="axiom">axiom</a>. On the other hand, if <a href="geometry">geometry</a> is developed before <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, this formula can be used to define <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s.

Most other simple formulas for area follow from the method of <a href="dissection%20%28geometry%29">dissection</a>.
This involves cutting a shape into pieces, whose areas must <a href="addition">sum</a> to the area of the original shape.

For an example, any <a href="parallelogram">parallelogram</a> can be subdivided into a <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a> and a <a href="right%20triangle">right triangle</a>, as shown in figure to the left. If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle. It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:
However, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a <a href="diagonal">diagonal</a> into two <a href="congruence%20%28geometry%29">congruent</a> triangles, as shown in the figure to the right. It follows that the area of each <a href="triangle">triangle</a> is half the area of the parallelogram:
Similar arguments can be used to find area formulas for the <a href="trapezoid">trapezoid</a> as well as more complicated <a href="polygon">polygon</a>s.

The formula for the area of a <a href="circle">circle</a> (more properly called the area enclosed by a circle or the area of a <a href="disk%20%28mathematics%29">disk</a>) is based on a similar method. Given a circle of radius , it is possible to partition the circle into <a href="Circular%20sector">sectors</a>, as shown in the figure to the right. Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form and approximate parallelogram. The height of this parallelogram is , and the width is half the <a href="circumference">circumference</a> of the circle, or . Thus, the total area of the circle is :
Though the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors. The <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limit</a> of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly , which is the area of the circle.

This argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of <a href="calculus">calculus</a>. In ancient times, the <a href="method%20of%20exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a> was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to <a href="integral%20calculus">integral calculus</a>. Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a <a href="definite%20integral">definite integral</a>:

The formula for the area enclosed by an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a> is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major</a> and <a href="semi-minor%20axis">semi-minor</a> axes and the formula is:

Most basic formulas for <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out. For example, if the side surface of a <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> (or any <a href="prism%20%28geometry%29">prism</a>) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle. Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a <a href="cone%20%28geometry%29">cone</a>, the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed.

The formula for the surface area of a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> is more difficult to derive: because a sphere has nonzero <a href="Gaussian%20curvature">Gaussian curvature</a>, it cannot be flattened out. The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> in his work "<a href="On%20the%20Sphere%20and%20Cylinder">On the Sphere and Cylinder</a>". The formula is:
where is the radius of the sphere. As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to <a href="calculus">calculus</a>.


(see <a href="Green%27s%20theorem">Green's theorem</a>) or the "z"-component of

To find the bounded area between two <a href="quadratic%20function">quadratic function</a>s, we subtract one from the other to write the difference as
where "f"("x") is the quadratic upper bound and "g"("x") is the quadratic lower bound. Define the <a href="discriminant">discriminant</a> of "f"("x")-"g"("x") as
By simplifying the integral formula between the graphs of two functions (as given in the section above) and using <a href="Vieta%27s%20formulas">Vieta's formula</a>, we can obtain
The above remains valid if one of the bounding functions is linear instead of quadratic.


The general formula for the surface area of the graph of a continuously differentiable function formula_35 where formula_36 and formula_37 is a region in the xy-plane with the smooth boundary:
An even more general formula for the area of the graph of a <a href="parametric%20surface">parametric surface</a> in the vector form formula_39 where formula_40 is a continuously differentiable vector function of formula_41 is:

The above calculations show how to find the areas of many common <a href="shapes">shapes</a>.

The areas of irregular polygons can be calculated using the "<a href="Surveyor%27s%20formula">Surveyor's formula</a>".

The <a href="isoperimetric%20inequality">isoperimetric inequality</a> states that, for a closed curve of length "L" (so the region it encloses has <a href="perimeter">perimeter</a> "L") and for area "A" of the region that it encloses,

and equality holds if and only if the curve is a <a href="circle">circle</a>. Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter.

At the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter "L" could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a <a href="rhombus">rhombus</a> that is "tipped over" arbitrarily far so that two of its <a href="angle">angle</a>s are arbitrarily close to 0° and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180°.

For a circle, the ratio of the area to the <a href="circumference">circumference</a> (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the <a href="radius">radius</a> "r". This can be seen from the area formula "πr" and the circumference formula 2"πr".

The area of a <a href="regular%20polygon">regular polygon</a> is half its perimeter times the <a href="apothem">apothem</a> (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side).

Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). But if the one-dimensional lengths of a <a href="fractal">fractal</a> drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the <a href="fractal%20dimension">fractal dimension</a> of the fractal.
There are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle. Three of them are the <a href="Median%20%28triangle%29">medians</a> of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are <a href="Concurrent%20lines">concurrent</a> at the triangle's <a href="centroid">centroid</a>; indeed, they are the only area bisectors that go through the centroid. Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its <a href="incircle">incircle</a>). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.

Any line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area.

All area bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go through the center, and any <a href="Chord%20%28geometry%29">chords</a> through the center bisect the area. In the case of a circle they are the diameters of the circle.

Given a wire contour, the surface of least area spanning ("filling") it is a <a href="minimal%20surface">minimal surface</a>. Familiar examples include <a href="soap%20bubble">soap bubble</a>s.

The question of the <a href="filling%20area%20conjecture">filling area</a> of the <a href="Riemannian%20circle">Riemannian circle</a> remains open.

The circle has the largest area of any two-dimensional object having the same perimeter.

A <a href="cyclic%20polygon">cyclic polygon</a> (one inscribed in a circle) has the largest area of any polygon with a given number of sides of the same lengths.

A version of the <a href="isoperimetric%20inequality">isoperimetric inequality</a> for triangles states that the triangle of greatest area among all those with a given perimeter is <a href="equilateral">equilateral</a>.

The triangle of largest area of all those inscribed in a given circle is equilateral; and the triangle of smallest area of all those circumscribed around a given circle is equilateral.

The ratio of the area of the incircle to the area of an equilateral triangle, formula_44, is larger than that of any non-equilateral triangle.

The ratio of the area to the square of the perimeter of an equilateral triangle, formula_45 is larger than that for any other triangle.

Astronomical unit

The astronomical unit (symbol: au or ua) is a <a href="unit%20of%20length">unit of length</a>, roughly the distance from <a href="Earth">Earth</a> to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. However, that distance varies as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (<a href="aphelion">aphelion</a>) to a minimum (<a href="perihelion">perihelion</a>) and back again once a year. Originally conceived as the average of Earth's aphelion and perihelion, it is now defined as exactly metres (about 150 million kilometres, or 93 million miles). The astronomical unit is used primarily as a convenient yardstick for measuring distances within the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> or around other stars. However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another unit of astronomical length, the <a href="parsec">parsec</a>.

A variety of unit symbols and abbreviations have been in use for the astronomical unit. In a 1976 resolution, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) used the symbol "A" for the astronomical unit. In the astronomical literature, the symbol AU was (and remains) common. In 2006, the <a href="International%20Bureau%20of%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Bureau of Weights and Measures</a> (BIPM) recommended ua as the symbol for the unit. In the non-normative Annex C to <a href="ISO%2080000-3">ISO 80000-3</a> (2006), the symbol of the astronomical unit is "ua". In 2012, the IAU, noting "that various symbols are presently in use for the astronomical unit", recommended the use of the symbol "au". In the 2014 revision of the SI Brochure, the BIPM used the unit symbol "au".

<a href="Earth%27s%20orbit">Earth's orbit</a> around the Sun is an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>. The <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major axis</a> of this <a href="elliptic%20orbit">elliptic orbit</a> is defined to be half of the straight <a href="line%20segment">line segment</a> that joins the <a href="perihelion%20and%20aphelion">perihelion and aphelion</a>. The centre of the Sun lies on this straight line segment, but not at its midpoint. Because ellipses are well-understood shapes, measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically, and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation. In addition, it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance that Earth traverses over the course of a year, defining times and places for observing the largest <a href="parallax">parallax</a> (apparent shifts of position) in nearby stars. Knowing Earth's shift and a star's shift enabled the star's distance to be calculated. But all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty, and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances. Improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding. Throughout the twentieth century, measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated, and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein's</a> <a href="theory%20of%20relativity">theory of relativity</a> and upon the mathematical tools it used.

Improving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of our understanding of the laws of <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>, which govern the motions of objects in space. The expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated (in AU) from these laws, and assembled into a collection of data called an <a href="ephemeris">ephemeris</a>. <a href="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> provides one of several ephemeris computation services.

In 1976, in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit, the IAU formally adopted <a href="IAU%20%281976%29%20System%20of%20Astronomical%20Constants">a new definition</a>. Although directly based on the then-best available observational measurements, the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides. It stated that "the astronomical unit of length is that length ("A") for which the <a href="Gaussian%20gravitational%20constant">Gaussian gravitational constant</a> ("k") takes the value when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time". Equivalently, by this definition, one AU is the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with an <a href="angular%20frequency">angular frequency</a> of ; or alternatively that length for which the <a href="standard%20gravitational%20parameter">heliocentric gravitational constant</a> (the product "G") is equal to () AU/d, when the length is used to describe the positions of objects in the Solar System.

Subsequent explorations of the Solar System by <a href="space%20probe">space probe</a>s made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the <a href="Solar%20System%23Inner%20planets">inner planets</a> and other objects by means of <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a>. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for <a href="photons">photons</a> to be reflected from an object. Because all photons move at the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is basically the product of the speed of light and the measured time. However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation. Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the <a href="Barycentric%20Dynamical%20Time">TDB</a> scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of ). By 2009, the IAU had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements, and calculated the speed of light at (TDB).

In 1983, the <a href="International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (CIPM) modified the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI, or "modern" metric system) to make the metre independent of physical objects entirely, because other measurements had become too precise for reference to the prototype platinum metre to remain useful. Instead, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum, which could be independently determined at need. The speed of light could then be expressed exactly as "c" = , a standard also adopted by the <a href="International%20Earth%20Rotation%20and%20Reference%20Systems%20Service">IERS</a> numerical standards. From this definition and the 2009 IAU standard, the time for light to traverse an AU is found to be τ = , more than 8 minutes. By multiplication, the best IAU 2009 estimate was "A" = "c"τ = , based on a comparison of <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">JPL</a> and <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">IAA–RAS</a> ephemerides.

In 2006, the BIPM reported a value of the astronomical unit as . In the 2014 revision of the SI Brochure, the BIPM recognised the IAU's 2012 redefinition of the astronomical unit as .

This estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error, and based on techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects, and thus were not constant for all observers. In 2012, finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex, the IAU simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre (exactly ). The new definition also recognizes as a consequence that the astronomical unit is now to play a role of reduced importance, limited in its use to that of a convenience in some applications.

This definition makes the speed of light, defined as exactly , equal to exactly  ×  ÷  or about AU/d, some 60 parts per <a href="Orders%20of%20magnitude%20%28numbers%29%231012">trillion</a> less than the 2009 estimate.

With the definitions used before 2012, the astronomical unit was dependent on the <a href="heliocentric%20gravitational%20constant">heliocentric gravitational constant</a>, that is the product of the <a href="gravitational%20constant">gravitational constant</a> "G" and the <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a> . Neither "G" nor can be measured to high accuracy separately, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets (<a href="Kepler%27s%20Third%20Law">Kepler's Third Law</a> expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an <a href="ephemeris">ephemeris</a>, so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. In particular, time intervals measured on Earth's surface (<a href="terrestrial%20time">terrestrial time</a>, TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer during the Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter during the Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the "planetary second" (conventionally measured in <a href="barycentric%20dynamical%20time">barycentric dynamical time</a>, TDB). This is because the distance between Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between and ) and, when Earth is closer to the Sun (<a href="perihelion">perihelion</a>), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and Earth is moving faster along <a href="Earth%27s%20orbit">its orbital path</a>. As the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the "planetary metre" on a periodic basis.

The metre is defined to be a unit of <a href="proper%20length">proper length</a>, but the SI definition does not specify the <a href="metric%20tensor%20%28general%20relativity%29">metric tensor</a> to be used in determining it. Indeed, the <a href="International%20Committee%20for%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Committee for Weights and Measures</a> (CIPM) notes that "its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored". As such, the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the <a href="frame%20of%20reference">frame of reference</a> in which time is to be measured, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed, and "vigorous debate" ensued until in August 2012 the IAU adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit = <a href="metre">metre</a>s.

The astronomical unit is typically used for <a href="stellar%20system">stellar system</a> scale distances, such as the size of a protostellar disk or the heliocentric distance of an asteroid, whereas other units are used for <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">other distances in astronomy</a>. The astronomical unit is too small to be convenient for interstellar distances, where the <a href="parsec">parsec</a> and <a href="light-year">light-year</a> are widely used. The parsec (parallax arcsecond) is defined in terms of the astronomical unit, being the distance of an object with a <a href="parallax">parallax</a> of 1 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>. The light-year is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit and is rarely used by professional astronomers.

When simulating a <a href="numerical%20model%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">numerical model of the Solar System</a>, the astronomical unit provides an appropriate scale that minimizes (<a href="arithmetic%20overflow">overflow</a>, <a href="arithmetic%20underflow">underflow</a> and <a href="truncation">truncation</a>) errors in <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> calculations.

According to <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> in the "<a href="Sand%20Reckoner">Sandreckoner</a>" (2.1), <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samos">Aristarchus of Samos</a> estimated the distance to the Sun to be times Earth's radius (the true value is about ). However, the book "<a href="On%20the%20Sizes%20and%20Distances%20of%20the%20Sun%20and%20Moon">On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon</a>", which has long been ascribed to Aristarchus, says that he calculated the distance to the Sun to be between 18 and 20 times the <a href="Lunar%20distance%20%28astronomy%29">distance to the Moon</a>, whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the <a href="Lunar%20phase">half moon</a> and the Sun, which he estimated as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°). Depending on the distance that Van Helden assumes Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and Earth radii.

According to <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> in the "<a href="Preparation%20for%20the%20Gospel">Praeparatio Evangelica</a>" (pageRank.Book XV, Chapter 53), <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> found the distance to the Sun to be "σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας" (literally "of "stadia" <a href="myriad">myriad</a>s 400 and " but with the additional note that in the Greek text the <a href="Agreement%20%28linguistics%29">grammatical agreement</a> is between "myriads" (not "stadia") on the one hand and both "400" and "" on the other, as in Greek, unlike English, all three (or all four if one were to include "stadia") words are <a href="Inflection">inflected</a>. This has been translated either as "<a href="stadion%20%28unit%20of%20length%29">stadia</a>" (1903 translation by <a href="Edwin%20Hamilton%20Gifford">Edwin Hamilton Gifford</a>), or as "stadia" (edition of <a href="https%3A//de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C3%2589douard_des_Places%26quot%3B%C3%89dourad">des Places"</a>, dated 1974–1991). Using the Greek stadium of 185 to 190 metres, the former translation comes to to , which is far too low, whereas the second translation comes to 148.7 to 152.8 million kilometres (accurate within 2%). <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> also gave an estimate of the distance of Earth from the Sun, quoted by <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus</a> as equal to 490 Earth radii. According to the conjectural reconstructions of <a href="Noel%20Swerdlow">Noel Swerdlow</a> and <a href="G.%20J.%20Toomer">G. J. Toomer</a>, this was derived from his assumption of a "least perceptible" solar parallax of 7 arc minutes.

A Chinese mathematical treatise, the "<a href="Zhoubi%20Suanjing">Zhoubi Suanjing</a>" (c. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places <a href="Li%20%28length%29">li</a> apart and the assumption that Earth is flat.

In the 2nd century CE, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> estimated the mean distance of the Sun as times <a href="Earth%20radius">Earth's radius</a>. To determine this value, Ptolemy started by measuring the Moon's parallax, finding what amounted to a horizontal lunar parallax of 1° 26′, which was much too large. He then derived a maximum lunar distance of 64 Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct. He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, <a href="al-Fargh%C4%81n%C4%AB">al-Farghānī</a> gave a mean solar distance of Earth radii, whereas in his "<a href="zij">zij</a>", <a href="al-Batt%C4%81n%C4%AB">al-Battānī</a> used a mean solar distance of Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as <a href="al-B%C4%ABr%C5%ABn%C4%AB">al-Bīrūnī</a>, used similar values. Later in Europe, <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Copernicus</a> and <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> also used comparable figures ( and Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.

<a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his "<a href="Rudolphine%20Tables">Rudolphine Tables</a>" (1627). <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a> allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the <a href="telescope">telescope</a> allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer <a href="Godefroy%20Wendelin">Godefroy Wendelin</a> repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the <a href="transit%20of%20Venus">transit of Venus</a>. By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the <a href="parallax">parallax</a> of Venus and from the relative distance of Earth and Venus from the Sun, the <a href="Parallax%23Solar%20parallax">solar parallax</a> "α" (which cannot be measured directly). <a href="Jeremiah%20Horrocks">Jeremiah Horrocks</a> had attempted to produce an estimate based on <a href="Transit%20of%20Venus%2C%201639">his observation of the 1639 transit</a> (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in <a href="Earth%20radius">Earth radii</a> by
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and Earth: a solar parallax of 15" is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of Earth radii.

<a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a> believed that the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, he estimated a value of about Earth radii, equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6". Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.
<a href="Jean%20Richer">Jean Richer</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Domenico%20Cassini">Giovanni Domenico Cassini</a> measured the parallax of Mars between <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Cayenne">Cayenne</a> in <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of 9", equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of Earth, which had been measured by their colleague <a href="Jean%20Picard">Jean Picard</a> in 1669 as thousand "<a href="toise">toise</a>s". Another colleague, <a href="Ole%20R%C3%B8mer">Ole Rømer</a>, discovered the finite <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or "light time per unit distance", a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by <a href="James%20Gregory%20%28astronomer%20and%20mathematician%29">James Gregory</a> and published in his "<a href="Optica%20Promata">Optica Promata</a>" (1663). It was strongly advocated by <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Despite the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour. The various results were collated by <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lalande">Jérôme Lalande</a> to give a figure for the solar parallax of 8.6″.
Another method involved determining the constant of <a href="aberration%20of%20light">aberration</a>. <a href="Simon%20Newcomb">Simon Newcomb</a> gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of ″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with <a href="Albert%20Abraham%20Michelson">A. A. Michelson</a> to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance), this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the <a href="Gaussian%20gravitational%20constant">Gaussian gravitational constant</a>) were incorporated into the first international system of <a href="astronomical%20constant">astronomical constant</a>s in 1896, which remained in place for the calculation of <a href="ephemeris">ephemerides</a> until 1964. The name "astronomical unit" appears first to have been used in 1903.

The discovery of the <a href="near-Earth%20asteroid">near-Earth asteroid</a> <a href="433%20Eros">433 Eros</a> and its passage near Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement. Another international project to measure the parallax of 433 Eros was undertaken in 1930–1931.

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.

The unit distance "A" (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in terms of other <a href="astronomical%20constant">astronomical constant</a>s:
where "G" is the <a href="Newtonian%20gravitational%20constant">Newtonian gravitational constant</a>, is the <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>, "k" is the numerical value of <a href="Gaussian%20gravitational%20constant">Gaussian gravitational constant</a> and "D" is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy, so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.

As the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant "k" is fixed in the <a href="astronomical%20system%20of%20units">astronomical system of units</a>, measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product "G" in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the <a href="secular%20variation">secular increase</a> in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, + metres per century.

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial. 
Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides.

The following table contains some distances given in astronomical units. It includes some examples with distances that are normally not given in astronomical units, because they are either too short or far too long. Distances normally change over time. Examples are listed by increasing distance.

Artist

An artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the <a href="arts">arts</a>, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday <a href="speech">speech</a> and academic <a href="discourse">discourse</a> is a practitioner in the <a href="visual%20art">visual art</a>s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a <a href="business">business</a> context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
The <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":


The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",
became the source of the English words <a href="wikt%3Atechnique">technique</a>, technology, <a href="wikt%3Atechnical">technical</a>.

In Greek culture each of the nine <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s oversaw a different field of human creation:

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.

The word "art" derives from the Latin "ars" (stem "art-"), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word "artist" already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling "craftsman", while the word "artesan" was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of <a href="Leon%20Battista%20Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a> (1404–1472): "<a href="De%20re%20aedificatoria">De re aedificatoria</a>, De statua, De pictura", which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a <a href="project">project</a> behind).

With the <a href="Academy">Academies</a> in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>.

"Artist" is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person <a href="creativity">creative</a> in, <a href="innovation">innovative</a> in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '<a href="high%20culture">high culture</a>', activities such as drawing, painting, <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>, acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, <a href="New%20media%20art">new media</a>, photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a> value. <a href="Art%20history">Art historians</a> and <a href="Art%20critic">critics</a> define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the <a href="applied%20arts">applied arts</a> or <a href="decorative%20arts">decorative arts</a> include <a href="artisan">artisan</a>, <a href="Master%20craftsman">craftsman</a>, and specialized terms such as <a href="pottery">potter</a>, <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a> or <a href="glassblower">glassblower</a>. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level, but in the 20th century the distinction became rather less relevant .

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "<a href="technician">technician</a>", "entertainer" and "<a href="artisan">artisan</a>", "<a href="fine%20arts">fine art</a>" and "<a href="applied%20art">applied art</a>", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word "artiste" (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in <a href="Music%20Hall">Music Hall</a> or <a href="Vaudeville">Vaudeville</a>). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a <a href="pejorative">pejorative</a> term.

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In "Living with Art", Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:

Actaeon

Actaeon (; "Aktaion"), in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, son of the priestly herdsman <a href="Aristaeus">Aristaeus</a> and <a href="Autonoe">Autonoe</a> in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, was a famous <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Theban</a> <a href="Greek%20hero%20cult">hero</a>. Like <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> in a later generation, he was trained by the centaur <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a>.

He fell to the fatal wrath of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, but the surviving details of his transgression vary: "the only certainty is in what Aktaion suffered, his <a href="pathos">pathos</a>, and what Artemis did: the hunter became the hunted; he was transformed into a <a href="stag">stag</a>, and his raging hounds, struck with a 'wolf's frenzy' (<a href="Lyssa">Lyssa</a>), tore him apart as they would a stag." This is the iconic motif by which Actaeon is recognized, both in ancient art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance depictions.

Among others, John Heath has observed, "The unalterable <a href="mytheme">kernel of the tale</a> was a hunter's transformation into a deer and his death in the jaws of his hunting dogs. But authors were free to suggest different motives for his death." In the version that was offered by the <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> poet <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a>, which has become the standard setting, Artemis was bathing in the woods when the hunter Actaeon stumbled across her, thus seeing her naked. He stopped and stared, amazed at her ravishing beauty. Once seen, Artemis got revenge on Actaeon: she forbade him speech — if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a <a href="Deer%20%28mythology%29">stag</a> — for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately transformed. At this he fled deep into the woods, and doing so he came upon a pond and, seeing his reflection, groaned. His own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him, not recognizing him. In an endeavour to save himself, he raised his eyes (and would have raised his arms, had he had them) toward Mount Olympus. The gods did not heed his plea, and he was torn to pieces. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a> made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.

There are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic "<a href="Catalogue%20of%20Women">Catalogue of Women</a>" and pseudo-Apollodoran "<a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Bibliotheke</a>" state that his offense was that he was a rival of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> for <a href="Semele">Semele</a>, his mother's sister, whereas in <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' "Bacchae" he has boasted that he is a better hunter than Artemis:
Further materials, including fragments that belong with the Hesiodic "Catalogue of Women" and at least four Attic tragedies, including a "Toxotides" of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, have been lost. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> (4.81.4), in a variant of Actaeon's "<a href="hubris">hubris</a>" that has been largely ignored, has it that Actaeon wanted to marry Artemis. Other authors say the hounds were Artemis' own; some lost elaborations of the myth seem to have given them all names and narrated their wanderings after his loss.

According to the Latin version of the story told by the Roman <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> having accidentally seen Diana (Artemis) on <a href="Mount%20Cithaeron">Mount Cithaeron</a> while she was bathing, he was changed by her into a stag, and pursued and killed by his fifty hounds. This version also appears in Callimachus' Fifth Hymn, as a mythical parallel to the blinding of <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a> after he sees Athena bathing.

The literary testimony of Actaeon's myth is largely lost, but Lamar Ronald Lacy, deconstructing the <a href="Mytheme">myth elements</a> in what survives and supplementing it by iconographic evidence in late vase-painting, made a plausible reconstruction of an ancient Actaeon myth that Greek poets may have inherited and subjected to expansion and dismemberment. His reconstruction opposes a too-pat consensus that has an archaic Actaeon aspiring to <a href="Semele">Semele</a>, a classical Actaeon boasting of his hunting prowess and a Hellenistic Actaeon glimpsing Artemis' bath. Lacy identifies the site of Actaeon's transgression as a spring sacred to Artemis at <a href="Plataea">Plataea</a> where Actaeon was a " <a href="Greek%20hero%20cult">hero archegetes</a>" ("hero-founder") The righteous hunter, the companion of Artemis, seeing her bathing naked at the spring, was moved to try to make himself her consort, as <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> noted, and was punished, in part for transgressing the hunter's "ritually enforced deference to Artemis" (Lacy 1990:42).

The following list is as given in Hyginus' "Fabulae". The first part of the list is taken from Ovid's "Metamorphoses" (pageRank.Book III, 206–235), and the second from an unknown source.

"Note:" In the first part of the list, Hyginus fails to correctly differentiate between masculine and feminine names.

Dogs: Melampus, Ichnobates, Pamphagos, Dorceus, Oribasos, Nebrophonos, Laelaps, Theron, Pterelas, Hylaeus, Ladon, Dromas, Tigris, Leucon, Asbolos, Lacon, Aello, Thoos, Harpalos, Melaneus, Labros, Arcas, Argiodus, Hylactor.

Bitches: Agre, Nape, Poemenis, Harpyia, Canache, Sticte, Alce, Lycisce, Lachne, Melanchaetes, Therodamas, Oresitrophos.

Dogs: Acamas, Syrus, Leon, Stilbon, Agrius, Charops, Aethon, Corus, Boreas, Draco, Eudromus, Dromius, Zephyrus, Lampus, Haemon, Cyllopodes, Harpalicus, Machimus, Ichneus, Melampus, Ocydromus, Borax, Ocythous, Pachylus, Obrimus;

Bitches: Argo, Arethusa, Urania, Theriope, Dinomache, Dioxippe, Echione, Gorgo, Cyllo, Harpyia, Lynceste, Leaena, Lacaena, Ocypete, Ocydrome, Oxyrhoe, Orias, *Sagnos, Theriphone, *Volatos, *Chediaetros.

In the second century AD, the traveller <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> was shown a spring on the road in <a href="Attica">Attica</a> leading to <a href="Plataea">Plataea</a> from <a href="Eleutherae">Eleutherae</a>, just beyond <a href="Megara">Megara</a> "and a little farther on a rock. It is called the bed of Actaeon, for it is said that he slept thereon when weary with hunting, and that into this spring he looked while Artemis was bathing in it."

In the standard version of the "<a href="Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a>" (tablet vi) there is a parallel, in the series of examples <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> gives <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> of her mistreatment of her serial lovers:
"You loved the herdsman, shepherd and chief shepherd<br> Who was always heaping up the glowing ashes for you,<br> And cooked ewe-lambs for you every day.<br> But you hit him and turned him into a wolf,<br> His own herd-boys hunt him down<br>
And his dogs tear at his haunches.<br><nowiki>"</nowiki>Actaeon, torn apart by dogs incited by Artemis, finds another Near Eastern parallel in the <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>ic hero <a href="Aqht">Aqht</a>, torn apart by eagles incited by <a href="Anath">Anath</a> who wanted his hunting bow.

The virginal Artemis of classical times is not directly comparable to Ishtar of the many lovers, but the <a href="mytheme">mytheme</a> of Artemis shooting <a href="Orion%20%28mythology%29">Orion</a>, was linked to her punishment of Actaeon by T.C.W. Stinton; the Greek context of the mortal's reproach to the amorous goddess is translated to the episode of <a href="Anchises">Anchises</a> and <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>. <a href="Daphnis">Daphnis</a> too was a herdsman loved by a goddess and punished by her: see <a href="Theocritus">Theocritus</a>' First Idyll.

In Greek Mythology, Actaeon is thought by many, including Hans Biedermann, to symbolize ritual human sacrifice in attempt to please a God or Goddess. In the case of Actaeon, the dogs symbolize the sacrificers and Actaeon symbolizes the sacrifice. Actaeon also may symbolize a human curiosity or irreverence.

The myth is seen by Jungian psychologist <a href="Wolfgang%20Giegerich">Wolfgang Giegerich</a> as a symbol for spiritual transformation and/or enlightenment.

The two main scenes are Actaeon surprising Artemis/Diana, and his death. In classical art Actaeon is normally shown as fully human, even as his hounds are killing him (sometimes he has small horns), but in Renaissance art he is often given a deer's head with antlers even in the scene with Diana, and by the time he is killed he has at the list this head and has often completely transformed into the shape of a deer.
