Ambergris

Ambergris ( or , , ), "ambergrease" or "grey amber", is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour, produced in the digestive system of <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>s.

Freshly-produced ambergris has a marine, <a href="feces">fecal</a> odour. However, as it ages, it acquires a sweet, earthy scent, commonly likened to the fragrance of <a href="Isopropyl%20alcohol">rubbing alcohol</a>, without the vaporous chemical astringency. Although ambergris used to be very highly valued by <a href="perfume">perfume</a>rs as a fixative (allowing the scent to last much longer), it has now largely been replaced by synthetic <a href="ambroxan">ambroxan</a>.

The word ambergris comes from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "ambre gris" or "grey amber", which in turn derives from the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> word "ʿanbar", meaning ambergris. The word "amber" comes from the same source but since the late 13th century in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, it has been applied almost exclusively to fossilised tree resins from the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic region</a>.

Ambergris is formed from a secretion of the <a href="biliary">bile duct</a> in the <a href="intestines">intestines</a> of the sperm whale, and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>s of dead sperm whales. Because the beaks of <a href="giant%20squid">giant squid</a>s have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten. The sperm whale usually vomits these, but if one travels further down the gut, it will be covered in ambergris.

Ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit. Ambergris takes years to form. Christopher Kemp, the author of "Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris", says that it is only produced by sperm whales, and only by an estimated one percent of them. Ambergris is rare; once expelled by a whale, it often floats for years before making landfall. The very small chance of finding ambergris, and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris.

Ambergris is primarily found in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and on the coasts of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>, <a href="The%20Maldives">The Maldives</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and the <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Molucca Islands</a>. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, particularly <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>. Fossilised ambergris from 1.75 million years ago has also been found.

A lump of ambergris, found on a beach at <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, was sold to a French buyer for £11,000 at an auction in <a href="Macclesfield">Macclesfield</a>, England, on 25 September 2015. A piece of ambergris was found by two Omanis, washed up on a beach on the Fooshi shores of Sadah province in southern <a href="Oman">Oman</a>, in November 2015.

Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, usually weighing from 15 g (~½ oz) to 50 kg (110 pounds), sometimes more. When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of <a href="photodegradation">photodegradation</a> and <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its smell has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of <a href="isopropanol">isopropanol</a> without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a <a href="specific%20gravity">specific gravity</a> ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62 °C to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at it is volatilised into a white vapour. It is soluble in <a href="diethyl%20ether">ether</a>, and in volatile and fixed oils.

Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid. White crystals of a <a href="terpene">terpene</a> known as <a href="ambrein">ambrein</a> can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool. Breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces <a href="ambroxan">ambroxan</a> and ambrinol, the main odor components of ambergris.

<a href="Ambroxan">Ambroxan</a> is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry.

Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like <a href="musk">musk</a>. Perfumes can still be found with ambergris around the world. It is collected from remains found at sea and on beaches, although its precursor originates from the sperm whale, which is a vulnerable species.

<a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ians burned ambergris as incense, while in modern <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes. The <a href="History%20of%20China%23Ancient%20China">ancient Chinese</a> called the substance "dragon's spittle fragrance". During the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from getting the plague. This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be a <a href="Miasma%20theory%20of%20disease">cause of plague</a>.

This substance has also been used historically as a <a href="flavor">flavor</a>ing for food and is considered an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a> in some cultures. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Europeans used ambergris as a <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">medication</a> for <a href="headache">headache</a>s, <a href="Common%20cold">colds</a>, <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, and other ailments.

From the 18th to the mid-19th century, the whaling industry prospered. By some reports, nearly 5,000 whales, including sperm whales, were killed each year. Due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened, the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Although ambergris is not harvested from whales, many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales.

Urine, faeces and ambergris (that has been naturally excreted by a sperm whale) are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of a CITES species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the Convention.

A serving of eggs and ambergris was reportedly King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a>'s favorite dish.

In chapter 91 of <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" (1851), Stubb, one of the mates of the "<a href="Pequod%20%28Moby-Dick%29">Pequod</a>," fools the captain of a French whaler ("Rose-bud") into abandoning the corpse of a sperm whale found floating in the sea. His plan is to recover the corpse himself in hopes that it contains ambergris. His hope proves well founded, and the "Pequod"'s crew recovers a valuable quantity of the substance. Melville devotes the following chapter to a discussion of ambergris, with special attention to the irony that "fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale."

In "A Romance of Perfume Lands or the Search for Capt. Jacob Cole", F. S. Clifford, October 1881, the last chapter concerns one of the novel's characters discovering an area off of remote island which contains large amounts of ambergris. He hopes to use this knowledge to help make his fortune in the manufacture of perfumes.

Ambiorix

Ambiorix was, together with <a href="Cativolcus">Cativolcus</a>, prince of the <a href="Eburones">Eburones</a>, leader of a <a href="Belgae">Belgic</a> tribe of north-eastern <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> (<a href="Gallia%20Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a>), where modern <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> is located. In the nineteenth century Ambiorix became a <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> <a href="Folk%20hero">national hero</a> because of his <a href="Resistance%20movement">resistance</a> against <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, as written in Caesar's "<a href="Commentarii%20de%20Bello%20Gallico">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a>".

In 57 BC Julius Caesar conquered parts of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> and also <a href="Belgica">Belgica</a> (Belgium, modern-day Northern France, Luxembourg, part of present-day Netherlands below the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> River; and the north-western portion of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). There were several tribes in the country who fought against each other frequently. The <a href="Eburones">Eburones</a> were ruled by Ambiorix and <a href="Catuvolcus">Catuvolcus</a>. In 54 BC Caesar's troops urgently needed more food, and so the local tribes were forced to give up part of their <a href="harvest">harvest</a>, which had not been good that year. Understandably the <a href="starving">starving</a> Eburones were reluctant to do so and Caesar ordered that <a href="Military%20camp">camps</a> be built near the Eburones' villages. Each <a href="centurion">centurion</a> was ordered to make sure the food supplies were delivered to the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> <a href="soldiers">soldiers</a>. This created resentment among the Eburones.

Although <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> had freed him from paying tribute to the <a href="Atuatuci">Atuatuci</a>, Ambiorix joined <a href="Catuvolcus">Catuvolcus</a> in the winter of 54 BC in an uprising against the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> forces under <a href="Quintus%20Titurius%20Sabinus">Q. Titurius Sabinus</a> and <a href="Lucius%20Aurunculeius%20Cotta">L. Aurunculeius Cotta</a>.

Because a drought had disrupted his grain supply, Caesar was forced to winter his legions among the rebellious Belgic tribes. Roman troops led by Q. Titurius Sabinus and L. Aurunculeius Cotta were wintering among the Eburones when they were attacked by them, led by Ambiorix and Cativolcus. Ambiorix deceived the Romans, telling them the attack was made without his consent, and further advised them to flee as a large Germanic force was preparing to cross the Rhine. Trusting Ambiorix, Sabinus and Cotta's troops left the next morning. A short distance from their camp, the Roman troops were ambushed by the Eburones and massacred.

Elsewhere, another Roman force under <a href="Quintus%20Tullius%20Cicero">Q. Tullius Cicero</a>, brother of the orator <a href="Marcus%20Tullius%20Cicero">Marcus</a>, were wintering amongst the Nervii. Leading a coalition of rebellious Belgic tribes, Ambiorix surrounded Cicero's camp. After a long while, a Roman messenger was finally able to slip through the Belgic lines and get word of the uprising to Caesar. Mobilizing his legions, Caesar immediately marched to Cicero's aid. As they approached the besieged Roman camp, the Belgae moved to engage Caesar's troops. Vastly outnumbered, Caesar ordered his troops to appear confused and frightened, and they successfully lured the Belgae to attack them on ground favourable to the Romans. Caesar's forces launched a fierce counterattack, and soon put the Belgae to flight. Later, Caesar's troops entered Cicero's camp to find most of the men wounded.

Meanwhile, Indutiomarus, a leader of the Treveri, began to harass Labienus's camp daily, eventually provoking Labienus to send out his cavalry with specific orders to kill Indutiomarus. They did so, and routed the remnants of Indutiomarus's army. Caesar personally remained in Gaul for the remainder of winter due to the renewed Gallic threat.

When the <a href="Roman%20senate">Roman senate</a> heard what had happened, Caesar swore to put down all the Belgic tribes. Ambiorix had killed a whole Roman <a href="Roman%20legion%23Imperial%20legion">legion</a> and five <a href="Cohort%20%28military%20unit%29">cohorts</a>. A Belgic attack on Q. Tullius Cicero, then stationed with a legion in the territory of the <a href="Nervii">Nervii</a>, failed due to the timely appearance of Caesar. The Roman campaigns against the Belgae took a few years, but eventually the tribes were slaughtered or driven out and their fields burned. The Eburones disappeared from history after this genocidal event. According to the writer <a href="Florus">Florus</a>, Ambiorix and his men succeeded in crossing the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and disappeared without a trace.

Caesar wrote about Ambiorix in his commentary about his battles against the Gauls, "<a href="De%20Bello%20Gallico">De Bello Gallico</a>". In this text he also wrote the famous line: "Of these [three regions], the Belgae are the bravest." ("... "Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae" ...").

Ambiorix remained a relatively obscure figure until the nineteenth century. When Belgium became independent in 1830 the national government started searching through their historical archives for people who could serve as <a href="national%20heroes">national heroes</a>. In Caesar's "De Bello Gallico", Ambiorix and his deeds was rediscovered. In 1841 the Belgian poet Joannes Nolet de Brauwere Van Steeland wrote a <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyric</a>al <a href="epic%20poetry">epic</a> about Ambiorix and on September 5, 1866 a statue of Ambiorix was erected on the main market square in <a href="Tongeren">Tongeren</a>, Belgium, referred to by Caesar as <a href="Atuatuca">Atuatuca</a>, i.e. Atuatuca Tungrorum.

Today, Ambiorix is one of the most famous characters in <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> history. Many companies, bars and <a href="friterie">friterie</a>s have named themselves after him, and in many Belgian <a href="comics">comics</a> such as <a href="Suske%20en%20Wiske">Suske en Wiske</a> and <a href="Jommeke">Jommeke</a> he plays a guest role. There was also a short-lived comic called "Ambionix", which featured a scientist teleporting a Belgic chief, loosely based on Ambiorix, to modern-day Belgium.

In the French comic <a href="Asterix">Asterix</a>, in the album "<a href="Asterix%20in%20Belgium">Asterix in Belgium</a>", <a href="Asterix">Asterix</a>, <a href="Obelix">Obelix</a>, <a href="Dogmatix">Dogmatix</a> and <a href="Recurring%20characters%20in%20Asterix%23Vitalstatistix">Vitalstatistix</a> go to Belgium because they are angry with Caesar about his remark that the Belgians are the bravest of all the Gauls.

August Wilhelm Ambros

August Wilhelm Ambros (17 November 181628 June 1876) was an <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n composer and music historian of <a href="Czech%20people">Czech</a> descent.

He was born at <a href="M%C3%BDto">Mýto</a>, <a href="Rokycany%20District">Rokycany District</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. His father was a cultured man, and his mother was the sister of <a href="Raphael%20Georg%20Kiesewetter">Raphael Georg Kiesewetter</a> (1773–1850), the musical archaeologist and collector. Ambros studied at the <a href="Charles%20University%20of%20Prague">University of Prague</a> and was well-educated in music and the arts, which were his abiding passion. He was, however, destined for the law and an official career in the Austrian civil service, and he occupied various important posts under the ministry of justice, music being an <a href="avocation">avocation</a>.

From 1850 onwards he became well known as a critic and essay-writer, and in 1860 he began working on his magnum opus, his "History of Music", which was published at intervals from 1862 in five volumes, the last two (1878, 1882) being edited and completed by <a href="Otto%20Kade">Otto Kade</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Langhans">Wilhelm Langhans</a>.

Amazon River

The Amazon River, usually abbreviated to Amazon ( or ; <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and ), in <a href="South%20America">South America</a> is the <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20by%20discharge">largest river</a> by <a href="Discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> volume of water in the world and according to some authors, the <a href="List%20of%20rivers%20by%20length">longest in length</a>.
The headwaters of the <a href="Apur%C3%ADmac%20River">Apurímac River</a> on <a href="Nevado%20Mismi">Nevado Mismi</a> had been considered for nearly a century as the Amazon’s most distant source, until a 2014 study found it to be the Cordillera Rumi Cruz at the headwaters of the <a href="Mantaro%20River">Mantaro River</a> in Peru. The Mantaro and Apurímac join, and with other tributaries form the <a href="Ucayali%20River">Ucayali River</a>, which in turn meets the <a href="Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n%20River">Marañón River</a> upstream of <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, to form what countries other than Brazil consider to be the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the <a href="Solim%C3%B5es%20River">Solimões River</a> above its confluence with the <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a> to form what Brazilians call the Amazon at the <a href="Meeting%20of%20Waters">Meeting of Waters</a> () at <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, the river's largest city.

At an average discharge of about —approximately , greater than the next seven <a href="list%20of%20rivers%20by%20discharge">largest independent rivers</a> combined—the Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean. The <a href="Amazon%20basin">Amazon basin</a> is the largest <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> in the world, with an area of approximately . The portion of the river's drainage basin in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.

During what many <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a>s call the "<a href="formative%20stage">formative stage</a>", Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland <a href="agriculture">agrarian</a> systems. The <a href="Muisca%20economy%23Trade">trade</a> with Andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes, formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the <a href="Muisca%20Confederation">Muisca</a> and <a href="Inca%20Empire">Incas</a>. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.
Five types of archaeological mound have been noted in the Amazon region: shell refuse and artificial mounds, artificial earth platforms for entire villages, earth mounds and ridges for cultivation, causeways and canals, and figurative mounds, both geometric and biomorphic.
Shell mounds were the earliest evidences of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 years <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists. Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the <a href="Marajoara%20culture">Marajoara culture</a>. <a href="Figurative%20mound">Figurative mound</a>s are the most recent types of occupation.

There is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities. Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana travelled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon. These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilisations. For instance, pre-Columbian <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Brazil">indigenous people</a> on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. In order to achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by <a href="selective%20cultivation">selective cultivation</a> and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as "<a href="terra%20preta">terra preta</a> de índio" ("indian dark earth"). Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesised that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.

Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. James Stuart Olson wrote: "The <a href="Munduruku">Munduruku</a> expansion dislocated and displaced the <a href="Kawah%C3%ADb%20people">Kawahíb</a>, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups ... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River."

In March 1500, <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a> <a href="Vicente%20Y%C3%A1%C3%B1ez%20Pinz%C3%B3n">Vicente Yáñez Pinzón</a> was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River. Pinzón called the stream "Río Santa María del Mar Dulce", later shortened to "Mar Dulce", literally, "sweet sea", because of its fresh water pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, <a href="Francisco%20de%20Orellana">Francisco de Orellana</a>, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptised some of the affluents of the Amazonas like <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a>, <a href="Napo%20River">Napo</a> and <a href="Jurua">Jurua</a>. The name Amazonas is taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the female <a href="Amazons">Amazon</a> warriors from the ancient <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Hellenic culture</a> in Greece.

<a href="Gonzalo%20Pizarro">Gonzalo Pizarro</a> set off in 1541 to explore east of <a href="Quito">Quito</a> into the South American interior in search of "<a href="El%20Dorado">El Dorado</a>", the "city of gold" and <a href="La%20Canela">La Canela</a>, the "valley of <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a>". He was accompanied by his second-in-command <a href="Francisco%20de%20Orellana">Francisco de Orellana</a>. After , the <a href="Coca%20River">Coca River</a> joined the <a href="Napo%20River">Napo River</a> (at a point now known as <a href="Puerto%20Francisco%20de%20Orellana">Puerto Francisco de Orellana</a>); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as "Río de la Canela" ("Cinnamon River") and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.

De Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana apparently missed the confluence (probably with the <a href="Aguarico%20River">Aguarico</a>) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating "noxious plants", and near death. Seven men died at that village. His men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join Pizarro's larger party. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600 km down the Napo River they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a>, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solimões, for a further to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>), which they reached on 3 June 1542. On the <a href="Nhamunda%20River">Nhamunda River</a>, a tributary of the Amazon downstream from Manaus, Orellana's party had a fierce battle with warriors who, they reported, were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat. Orellana's men began referring to the women as <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a>, a reference to the tribe of women warriors from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>. The river was initially known as the "<a href="Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n%20River">Marañón</a>" (the name by which the Peruvian part of the river is still known today) or "Rio de Orellana". It later became known as the "Rio Amazonas", the name by which it is still known in both Spanish and Portuguese.

Regarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. In fact, true cinnamon ("Cinnamomum verum") is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family "Lauraceae") are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.

In 1560 another Spanish <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a>, <a href="Lope%20de%20Aguirre">Lope de Aguirre</a>, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the <a href="Orinoco%20River">Orinoco River</a>, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.

Portuguese explorer <a href="Pedro%20Teixeira">Pedro Teixeira</a> was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.

From 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian "<a href="bandeirante">bandeirante</a>" <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Raposo%20Tavares">António Raposo Tavares</a> led an expedition from <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a> overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of more than .

In what is currently Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, a number of <a href="colonisation">colonial</a> and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade, slaving and evangelisation among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the <a href="Urarina">Urarina</a>. In the late 1600s Spanish Jesuit Father <a href="Samuel%20Fritz">Samuel Fritz</a>, apostle of the Omaguas, established some forty mission villages.

Early scientific, zoological and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.

The <a href="Cabanagem">Cabanagem</a> revolt (1835–1840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30 to 40% of the population of <a href="Gr%C3%A3o-Par%C3%A1%20Province">Grão-Pará</a>, estimated at 100,000 people, died.

The total population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about two-thirds were Europeans and slaves, the slaves amounting to about 25,000. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Pará (now Belém), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Manáos, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as <a href="Tabatinga">Tabatinga</a>, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.

On 6 September 1850, Emperor <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II of Brazil</a> sanctioned a law authorising steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mauá (<a href="Irineu%20Evangelista%20de%20Sousa">Irineu Evangelista de Sousa</a>) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the "Companhia de Navegação e Comércio do Amazonas" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the "Monarca" ('Monarch'), the "Cametá", the "Marajó" and the "Rio Negro".

At first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Pará and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Pará and Cametá. This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.

The success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Purús and Negro; a third established a line between Pará and Manaus; and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.

On 31 July 1867 the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the <a href="upper%20Amazon">upper Amazon</a> basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga – on the Amazon; Cametá – on the Tocantins; Santarém – on the Tapajós; Borba – on the Madeira, and Manaus – on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.

Thanks in part to the <a href="mercantile">mercantile</a> development associated with <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for <a href="natural%20rubber">natural rubber</a>, the Peruvian city of <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a> became a thriving, cosmopolitan centre of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports. During the <a href="rubber%20boom">rubber boom</a> it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as <a href="typhus">typhus</a> and <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.

The first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company—the Amazon Steam Navigation Company—as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Purús and many other tributaries, such as the Marañón, to ports as distant as <a href="Nauta">Nauta</a>, Peru.

By the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were <a href="Natural%20rubber">India-rubber</a>, <a href="cacao%20bean">cacao bean</a>s, <a href="Brazil%20nut">Brazil nut</a>s and a few other products of minor importance, such as <a href="Fur">pelts</a> and exotic forest produce (<a href="resin">resin</a>s, barks, woven <a href="hammock">hammock</a>s, prized bird <a href="feather">feather</a>s, live animals) and extracted goods, such as <a href="lumber">lumber</a> and gold.

Since colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.

Four centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than , excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters. This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.

Wary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a>, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.

In the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the "economic miracle" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of "Operation Amazon", an economic development project that brought large scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.

However, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Programme. A large-scale colonisation programme saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the "land without people" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the <a href="Trans-Amazonian%20Highway">Trans-Amazonian Highway</a> ("Transamazônica").

The Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as <a href="BR-319">BR-319</a> (Manaus-<a href="Porto%20Velho">Porto Velho</a>), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.

Many settlements grew along the road from Brasília to Belém with the highway and National Integration Programme however the programme failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.

With a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of <a href="Amazonas%20%28Brazilian%20state%29">Amazonas</a>. The racial makeup of the city is 64% <a href="pardo">pardo</a> (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% <a href="White%20Brazilian">white</a>.

Although the Amazon river remains largely undammed, around 412 dams are in operation in the Amazon’s tributary rivers. From these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon. Since only four percent of the Amazon’s hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil, more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned. After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River, scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by “blocking-fish spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests”. Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the “end of free flowing rivers” and contribute to an “ecosystem collapse” that will cause major social problems.

The most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apurímac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996, 2001, 2007, and 2008, where various authors identified the snowcapped <a href="Nevado%20Mismi">Nevado Mismi</a> peak, located roughly west of <a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> and southeast of <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada <a href="Carhuasanta">Carhuasanta</a> emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms Río Lloqueta which becomes Río Hornillos and eventually joins the <a href="Apur%C3%ADmac%20River">Río Apurímac</a>.

A 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in "<a href="Area%20%28journal%29">Area</a>", a peer-reviewed journal of the <a href="Royal%20Geographic%20Society">Royal Geographic Society</a>, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the <a href="Mantaro%20River">Río Mantaro</a> drainage. A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apurímac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Junín to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">class IV–V</a> nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower "Abyss" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.

After about , the Apurímac then joins Río Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the <a href="Urubamba%20River">Urubamba River</a> to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Marañón, some , the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage. The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>.

Although the Ucayali–Marañón confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the "<a href="Solim%C3%B5es">Solimões</a> das Águas". The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the "Solimões" and its tributaries, are called the "Upper Amazon".

The Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Perú. It has a series of major tributaries in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, some of which flow into the <a href="Mara%C3%B1%C3%B3n%20River">Marañón</a> and <a href="Ucayali">Ucayali</a>, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers <a href="Putumayo%20River">Putumayo</a>, <a href="Caquet%C3%A1%20River">Caquetá</a>, <a href="Vaup%C3%A9s%20River">Vaupés</a>, <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Guainía</a>, <a href="Morona">Morona</a>, <a href="Pastaza%20River">Pastaza</a>, Nucuray, Urituyacu, <a href="Chambira%20River">Chambira</a>, <a href="Tigre%20River">Tigre</a>, <a href="Nanay%20River">Nanay</a>, <a href="Napo%20River">Napo</a>, and <a href="Huallaga%20River">Huallaga</a>.

At some points the river divides into <a href="anabranch">anabranch</a>es, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral <a href="Stream%20channel">channels</a>, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat "igapó" lands, which are never more than above low river, into many islands.

From the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.

The Lower Amazon begins where the darkly coloured waters of the Rio Negro meet the sandy coloured <a href="Solim%C3%B5es">Rio Solimões</a>, and for over these waters run side by side without mixing. At Óbidos, a bluff above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a <a href="bay">gulf</a> of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos.

Only about ten percent of the Amazon's water enters downstream of Óbidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above Óbidos city is about , and, below, only about (around 20%), exclusive of the of the Tocantins basin. The <a href="Tocantins%20River">Tocantins River</a> enters the southern portion of the <a href="Amazon%20delta">Amazon delta</a>.

In the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as <a href="Monte%20Alegre%2C%20Par%C3%A1">Monte Alegre</a>. These hills are cut down to a kind of <a href="Terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terrace</a> which lies between them and the river.

On the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Brazil">Santarém</a> in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapajós, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapajós river valley.

<a href="Bel%C3%A9m">Belém</a> is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Pará and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called "furos" near the town of <a href="Breves%2C%20Brazil">Breves</a>; between them lies <a href="Maraj%C3%B3">Marajó</a>, the world's largest combined river/sea island.

If the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon <a href="estuary">estuary</a> is some wide. In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of <a href="Pracu%C3%BAba">Pracuúba</a> in the Brazilian state of <a href="Amap%C3%A1">Amapá</a>, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of <a href="Curu%C3%A7%C3%A1">Curuçá</a>, in the state of <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>.

A more conservative measurement excluding the Pará river estuary, from the mouth of the <a href="Araguari%20River%20%28Amap%C3%A1%29">Araguari River</a> to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Marajó, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over . If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curuá (state of Amapá) and Jurupari (state of Pará), the width falls to about .

The plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.

While debate as to whether the Amazon or <a href="Nile">the Nile</a> is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between long. It is often said to be "at least" long. The Nile is reported to be anywhere from . Often it is said to be "about" long. There are many factors that can affect these measurements.

A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile. Using <a href="Nevado%20Mismi">Nevado Mismi</a>, which in 2001 was labelled by the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> as the Amazon's source, these scientists made new calculations of the Amazon's length. They calculated the Amazon's length as . Using the same techniques, they calculated the length of the Nile as , which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. They made it possible by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of "Canal do Sul" and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the "Río Pará" bay in its entire length. <a href="Guido%20Gelli">Guido Gelli</a>, director of science at the <a href="Brazilian%20Institute%20of%20Geography%20and%20Statistics">Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics</a> (IBGE), told the Brazilian TV network <a href="Rede%20Globo">Globo</a> in June 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the Amazon was the longest river in the world. However, other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001, and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists. The length of both the Amazon and the Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.

The Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately . It drains from west to east, from <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a> in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from <a href="5th%20parallel%20north">5 degrees north latitude</a> to <a href="20th%20parallel%20south">20 degrees south latitude</a>. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-<a href="Andes">Andean</a> plateau, just a short distance from the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. The locals often refer to it as "El Jefe Negro", referring to an ancient god of fertility.

The Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than , flooding the surrounding forests, known as "<a href="Freshwater%20swamp%20forest">várzea</a>" ("flooded forests"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world. In an average <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>, of land are water-covered, while in the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to .

The quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to in the rainy season, with an average of from 1973 to 1990. The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's <a href="freshwater">fresh water</a> entering the ocean. The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about long and between wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the <a href="salinity">salinity</a> and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.

The Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.

There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the <a href="Orinoco">Orinoco</a> basins, the so-called <a href="Casiquiare%20canal">Casiquiare canal</a>. The Casiquiare is a river <a href="distributary">distributary</a> of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called <a href="River%20bifurcation">bifurcation</a>.

Not all of the Amazon's tributaries flood at the same time of the year. Many branches begin flooding in November and may continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon.

The depth of the Amazon between <a href="Manacapuru">Manacapuru</a> and <a href="%C3%93bidos%2C%20Brazil">Óbidos</a> has been calculated as between . At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about above <a href="Sea%20level">mean sea level</a>. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level. In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages , in some places as much as .

The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels of and <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> can reach as far as <a href="Iquitos">Iquitos</a>, Peru, from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the <a href="Pongo%20de%20Manseriche">Pongo de Manseriche</a>, just above Achual Point in Peru.

Annual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting <a href="Undular%20bore%23In%20hydraulics">undular</a> <a href="tidal%20bore">tidal bore</a> is called the "<a href="pororoca">pororoca</a>", with a leading wave that can be up to high and travel up to inland.

The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>.

The proto-Amazon during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Fifteen million years ago, the main <a href="tectonic%20uplift">tectonic uplift</a> phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> underneath the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a>. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and <a href="Guayana%20Shield">Guyana</a> bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the freshwaters of the Amazon.

Eleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a>s, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the world's largest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.

Paralleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the <a href="Hamza%20River">Hamza River</a>, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.

More than one-third of all known species in the world live in the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>, a giant tropical forest and river basin with an area that stretches more than . It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. There are over 3,000 species of fish currently recognised in the Amazon basin, with more being discovered every year. In addition to the thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.

Along with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the "<a href="boto">boto</a>", also known as the <a href="Amazon%20river%20dolphin">Amazon river dolphin</a> ("Inia geoffrensis"). It is the largest species of <a href="river%20dolphin">river dolphin</a>, and it can grow to lengths of up to . The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths. The "boto" is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a> that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.

The <a href="tucuxi">tucuxi</a> ("Sotalia fluviatilis"), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The <a href="Amazonian%20manatee">Amazonian manatee</a> ("Trichechus inunguis"), also known as "seacow", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into salt water.

Alfred of Beverley

Alredus, or Alfred of Beverley, (<a href="floruit">fl.</a> 1143), <a href="English%20historians%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">English chronicler</a>, was <a href="sacristan">sacristan</a> of the church of <a href="Beverley">Beverley</a> in the first half of the twelfth century.

He wrote, apparently about the year 1143, a <a href="chronicle">chronicle</a> entitled "Annales sive Historia de gestis regum Britanniae", which begins with <a href="Brutus%20of%20Britain">Brutus</a> and carries the history of England down to 1129. <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> and <a href="Simeon%20of%20Durham">Simeon of Durham</a> are Alfred's chief sources.

Alfred of Beverley, was a priest of Beverley, and is described in the preface to his book as "treasurer of the church of Beverley" and "Master Alfred, sacrist of the church of Beverley".

Alfred of Beverley speaks of himself as contemporary with the removal of the Flemings from the north of England to Ross in Herefordshire in 1112, and writes that he compiled his chronicle "when the church was silent, owing to the number of persons excommunicated under the decree of the council of London", an apparent reference to the council held at Mid-Lent, 1143. His attention, by his own account, was first drawn to history by the publication (before 1139) of <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth's</a> <a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>, and he looked forward to following up the chronicle which bears his name, and which largely depends on Geoffrey's work, with a collection of excerpts from the credible portions of the <a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>, but no trace of such a work is extant.

Alfred of Beverley's chronicle is entitled "Aluredi Beverlacensis Annales sive Historia de gestis Regum Britanniæ libris ix. ad annum 1129". It is largely devoted to the fabulous history of Britain, and is mainly borrowed from <a href="Venerable%20Bede">Bede</a>, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>, when Geoffrey of Monmouth is not laid under contribution. Alfred quotes occasionally from <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>, <a href="Orosius">Orosius</a>, and <a href="Nennius">Nennius</a>, and names many Roman authors whom he had consulted in vain for references to Britain. The chronicle is of no real use to the historical student, since it adds no new fact to the information to be found in well-known earlier authorities.

According to Sidney Lee (1885) the best manuscript of Alfred's "Annales" was among the Hengwrt MSS. belonging to W. W. E. Wynne, Esq., of Peniarth, Merionethshire, and had not been printed. Hearne printed the ‘Annales’ in 1716 from an inferior Bodleian MS. (Rawl. B. 200).

<doc id="1715" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1715" title="Abu Bakr">
Abu Bakr

Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq ‘Abdallāh bin Abī Quḥāfah (; 573 CE22 August 634 CE) popularly known as Abu Bakr (), was a senior companion ("<a href="Sahabah">Sahabi</a>") and—through his daughter <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a>—the father-in-law of the <a href="Prophets%20and%20messengers%20in%20Islam">Islamic prophet</a> <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. Abu Bakr became the first openly declared <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> outside <a href="Muhammad%27s%20wives">Muhammad's family</a>. Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor to Muhammad. During Muhammad's lifetime, he was involved in several campaigns and treaties.

He ruled over the <a href="Rashidun%20Caliphate">Rashidun Caliphate</a> from 632 to 634 CE when he became the first Muslim <a href="Caliph">Caliph</a> following Muhammad's death. As caliph, Abu Bakr succeeded to the political and administrative functions previously exercised by Muhammad. He was commonly known as The Truthful (, ""). Abu Bakr's reign lasted for 2 years, 2 months and 14 days ending with his death after an illness.

Abu Bakr's full name was Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq Abd Allah ibn 'Uthman ibn Aamir ibn Amr ibn Ka'ab ibn Sa'ad ibn Taym (from whom the at-Taymi al-Quraishi) ibn Murrah ibn Ka'ab ibn Lu'ai ibn Ghalib ibn Fihr al-Quraishi.

The lineage of Abu Bakr joined that of Muhammad in the eighth degree in their common ancestor Murrah ibn Ka'b. The <a href="Patrilineality">patrilineal</a> <a href="Lineage%20%28anthropology%29">lineage</a> of <a href="Ab%20%28Semitic%29%23Arabic">Abu</a> Bakr was: Abu Bakr; the son of <a href="Uthman%20Abu%20Quhafa">Uthman Abu Quhafa</a>; the son of Amar; the son of Umru; the son of Kaab; the son of Saad; the son of Taym; the son of Murrah. The lineage of Muhammad was: Muhammad; the son of <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20Abd%20al%20Muttalib">Abd Allah ibn Abd al Muttalib</a>; the son of <a href="Abdul%20Muttalib">Abdul Muttalib</a>; the son of <a href="Hashim%20ibn%20%27Abd%20Manaf">Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf</a>; the son of <a href="Abd%20Manaf%20ibn%20Qusai">Abd Manaf ibn Qusai</a>; the son of <a href="Qusai%20ibn%20Kilab">Qusai ibn Kilab</a>; the son of <a href="Kilab%20ibn%20Murrah">Kilab ibn Murrah</a>; the son of Murrah.

In <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, the name "Abd Allah" means "servant of <a href="Allah">Allah</a>". One of his early titles, preceding his conversion to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, was "atiqe", "the saved one". Muhammad later reaffirmed this title when he said that Abu Bakr is the "atiqe" (the one saved from hell fire by God). He was called "Al-Siddiq" (the truthful) by Muhammad after he believed him in the event of <a href="Isra%20and%20Mi%27raj">Isra and Mi'raj</a> when other people didn't, and <a href="Ali">Ali</a> confirmed that title several times.

There is a dispute over his name being Abdullah. Ibn Hajar in "Al-Isaabah", vol. 4, p. 146 and many other narrations, narrates from Qasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr, "I asked Ayesha the name of Abu Bakr. She said Abdullah. I said people are saying Ateeq. She said Abu Quhafa had three children, one was Ateeq, second Mu’taq and third, Otaiq. All three names are similar and derived from the same root."

He was mentioned in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> as the "second of the two who lay in the cave" in reference to the event of <a href="Hijra%20%28Islam%29">hijra</a>, where with Muhammad he hid in the cave in <a href="Jabal%20Thawr">Jabal Thawr</a> from the <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>n search party that was sent after them, thus being one of few who were given direct mention in the Quran.

Imam <a href="Jafar%20al%20Sadiq">Jafar al Sadiq</a> famously narrated how the title "Siddiq" was given to Abu Bakr from Muhammad. Jafar was a direct descendant of Abu Bakr from his maternal side, as well as being a descendant of <a href="Ali">Ali</a> from his father's side. Jafar al-Sadiq was also the successor of the <a href="Naqshbandi">Naqshbandi</a> Sufi order believed to be originating from Abu Bakr himself. Imam Muhammad al Baqir, the father of Imam Jafar Sadiq, also called Abu Bakr with the title Siddiq.

Much of the available knowledge about Muhammad comes through Abu Bakr's daughter, Aisha. After the death of Abu Bakr, her brother <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Abu%20Bakr">Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a> was raised by Ali. After Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Umayyads, Aisha raised and taught her nephew <a href="Qasim%20ibn%20Muhammad%20ibn%20Abu%20Bakr">al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a>. Aisha also taught another nephew <a href="Urwah%20ibn%20Zubayr">Urwah ibn Zubayr</a>. He then taught his son <a href="Hisham%20ibn%20Urwah">Hisham ibn Urwah</a>, who was the main teacher of <a href="Malik%20ibn%20Anas">Malik ibn Anas</a> whose views many Sunni follow.

Qasim's mother was of ‘Ali's family and his daughter <a href="Farwah%20bint%20al-Qasim">Farwah bint al-Qasim</a>, who married <a href="Muhammad%20al-Baqir">Muhammad al-Baqir</a>, was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore al-Qasim was the grandson of the first caliph Abu Bakr and the grandfather of <a href="Ja%27far%20al-Sadiq">Ja'far al-Sadiq</a>.

Another of Abu Bakr's grandsons, <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20al-Zubayr">Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr</a>, was very close to <a href="Husayn%20bin%20Ali">Husayn bin Ali</a>. After Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kerbala">killed</a> by the army of <a href="Yazid%20I">Yazid I</a>, the Umayyad ruler, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr confronted Yazid and expelled him from <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, southern <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> and the greater part of <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, and parts of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Following a lengthy campaign, on his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother <a href="Asma%27%20bint%20Abu%20Bakr">Asma' bint Abu Bakr</a>, the daughter of the first caliph, for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son: "You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Army now under the control of the Umayyads.

Abu Bakr was born in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> some time in 573 CE, to a rich family in the <a href="Banu%20Taym">Banu Taym</a> <a href="clan">clan</a> of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a> tribe. Abu Bakr's father's name was <a href="Uthman%20Abu%20Quhafa">Uthman Abu Quhafa</a> (nicknamed "Abu Quhafa") and his mother was <a href="Salma%20Umm-ul-Khair">Salma bint Sakhar</a> (nicknamed "Umm-ul-Khair").

He spent his early childhood like other <a href="Arab">Arab</a> children of the time among the <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a>s who called themselves "Ahl-i-Ba'eer"- the people of the <a href="camel">camel</a>, and developed a particular fondness for camels. In his early years he played with the camel calves and goats, and his love for camels earned him the nickname ""Abu Bakr"", the father of the camel's calf.

When Abu Bakr was 10 years old, he went to <a href="Syria">Syria</a> along with his father with the merchants' <a href="Camel%20train">caravan</a>. Muhammad, who was 12 years old at the time, was also with the caravan. In 591 at the age of 18, Abu Bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant, which was the family's business. In the coming years Abu Bakr traveled extensively with caravans. Business trips took him to <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, Syria, and elsewhere. These travels brought him wealth and added to his experience. His business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance. Though his father, Uthman Abu Quhafa, was still alive, he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe.

Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families, Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for <a href="Arabic%20poetry">poetry</a>. He used to attend the annual fair at <a href="Sha%27ir">Ukaz</a>, and participate in poetical symposia. He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the <a href="genealogy">genealogy</a> of the Arab tribes, their stories and their <a href="politics">politics</a>.

A story is preserved that once when he was a child, his father took him to the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, and asked him to pray before the <a href="Idolatry">idols</a>. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said "O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol saying "O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. He lifted a stone, and addressing an idol said "Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>. Thereafter, he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols.

Abu Bakr was a thin man with white skin. Tabari relates (<a href="Suyuti">Suyuti</a> also relates the same through <a href="Ibn%20Sa%27d%20al-Baghdadi">Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi</a>'s report) from <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a> her description of Abu Bakr:
He was a man with fair skin, thin, emaciated, with a sparse beard, a slightly hunched frame, sunken eyes and protruding forehead, and the bases of his fingers were hairless.

On his return from a business trip from <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, he was informed by friends that in his absence Muhammad had declared himself the Messenger of God, and proclaimed a new religion. Tabari, the most famous Muslim historian, in his Ta'rikh quotes from Muhammad Bin Sa'ad Bin Abi Waqqas, who said: 
Other Sunni and all Shi'a Muslims maintain that the second person to publicly accept Muhammed as the messenger of God was <a href="Ali">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a>, the first being Muhammad's wife Khadija.

<a href="Ibn%20Kathir">Ibn Kathir</a> in his Al Bidaya Wal Nihayah disregards the above. He stated that the first woman to embrace Islam was Khadijah. Zaid bin Haarithah was the first freed slave to embrace Islam. And Ali ibn abi talib was the first child to embrace Islam for he has not even reached the age of puberty at the time. And Abu Bakr was the first free man to embrace Islam.

His wife <a href="Qutaylah%20bint%20Abd-al-Uzza">Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza</a> did not accept Islam and he divorced her. His other wife, <a href="Um%20Ruman">Um Ruman</a>, became a Muslim. All his children except <a href="Abdu%27l-Rahman%20ibn%20Abu%20Bakr">Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr</a> accepted Islam, and Abu Bakr separated from his son Abdu'l-Rahman.

His conversion brought many people to Islam. He persuaded his intimate friends to convert to Islam. and presented Islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted Islam.

Those who converted to Islam at the insistence of Abu Bakr were:

Abu Bakr's acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammad's mission. <a href="Islamic%20views%20on%20slavery">Slavery</a> was common in Mecca, and many slaves accepted Islam. When an ordinary free man accepted Islam, despite opposition, he would enjoy the protection of his tribe. For slaves however, there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution. Abu Bakr felt compassion for slaves, so he purchased eight slaves (four men and four women) and then freed them, paying 40,000 <a href="dinar">dinar</a> for their freedom.

The men were
The women were:

Most of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men. The father of Abu Bakr asked him why he doesn't liberate strong and young slaves who could be a source of strength for him, Abu Bakr replied that he was freeing the slaves for the sake of <a href="God%20in%20Islam">God</a>, and not for his own sake. According to Sunni tradition the following verses of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> were revealed due to this:
As for him who gives and is godfearing and confirms the reward most fair, We shall surely ease him to the Easing. {92:5–7}.

...he who gives his wealth to purify himself and confers no favour on any man for recompense, only seeking the Face of his Lord the Most High; and he shall surely be satisfied. {92:18–21}.
<a href="Shia%20Islam">Shias</a> maintain these verses were revealed about <a href="Ali">Ali</a>.

For three years after the birth of Islam, Muslims kept secret their faith, and prayed in secret. In 613 Muhammad was commanded by God to call people to Islam openly. The first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to Muhammad was delivered by Abu Bakr. In a fit of fury the young men of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a> tribe rushed at Abu Bakr, and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness. Following this incident Abu Bakr's mother converted to Islam. Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh. Abu Bakr's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan, but not by the entire Quraysh tribe.

In 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the <a href="Banu%20Hashim">Banu Hashim</a>. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment. Before it many Muslims migrated to <a href="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</a> (now Ethiopia). Abu Bakr, feeling distressed, set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there. He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna (chief of the Qarah tribe) outside Mecca, who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh. Abu Bakr went back to Mecca, it was a relief for him, but soon due to the pressure of Quraysh, Ad-Dughna was forced to renounce his protection. Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr.

In 620 Muhammad's wife and uncle died. Abu Bakr's daughter <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a> was engaged to Muhammad, however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later. In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad's <a href="Isra%20and%20Mi%27raj">Isra and Mi'raj</a> (Night Journey).

In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of <a href="Medina">Medina</a>, Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina. The migration began in batches. Ali was the last to remain in Mecca, entrusted with responsibility for settling any loans the Muslims had taken, and famously slept in the bed of Muhammad when the Quraysh led by Ikrima attempted to murder Muhammad as he slept. Meanwhile, Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad in his migration for Medina. Due to the danger of the Quraysh, they did not take the road to Medina. They moved in the opposite direction, and took refuge in a cave in <a href="Jabal%20Thawr">Jabal Thawr</a> some five miles south of Mecca. <a href="%60Abdullah%20ibn%20Abi%20Bakr">`Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr</a>, the son of Abu Bakr, would listen to the plans and talks of the Quraysh, and at night he would carry the news to the fugitives in the cave. <a href="Asma%20bint%20Abi%20Bakr">Asma bint Abi Bakr</a>, the daughter of Abu Bakr, brought them meals every day. Aamir, a servant of Abu Bakr, would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked. The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions. One party came close to the entrance to the cave, but was unable to sight them. Due to this, <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> verse was revealed. <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a>, <a href="Abu%20Sa%E2%80%98id%20al-Khudri">Abu Sa‘id al-Khudri</a> and <a href="Abdullah%20ibn%20Abbas">Abdullah ibn Abbas</a> in <a href="Tafsir">interpreting</a> this verse said that Abu Bakr was the companion who stayed with Muhammad in the cave.

After staying at the cave for three days and three nights, Abu Bakr and Muhammad proceed to <a href="Medina">Medina</a>, staying for some time at Quba, a suburb of Medina. While <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> sources portray Abu Bakr in an exalted light in the cave, <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> sources however generally tend to portray the incident in the cave as a Quranic condemnation of Abu Bakr for cowardice and fear.

In Medina, Muhammad decided to construct a <a href="mosque">mosque</a>. A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr. Muslims constructed a mosque named <a href="Al-Masjid%20al-Nabawi">Al-Masjid al-Nabawi</a> at the site and Abu Bakr also took part in construction. Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari (who was from Medina) as a <a href="Brotherhood%20among%20the%20Sahaba">brother in faith</a>. Abu Bakr's relationship with Khaarjah was most cordial, which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba, a daughter of Khaarijah.

Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sunh, a suburb of Medina, and Abu Bakr also settled there. After Abu Bakr's family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammad's.

The climate of Mecca was dry, but the climate of Medina was damp and this adversely affected the health of the immigrants, so that on arrival most of them fell sick. Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family. At Mecca, Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina. He was a wholesaler, and had his store at Sunh, and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina. Soon his business flourished at Medina. Early in 623, Abu Bakr's daughter <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a>, who was already engaged to Muhammad, was handed over to Muhammad in a simple marriage ceremony, and this further strengthened the relation between Abu Bakr and Muhammad.

In 624 Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Badr">Battle of Badr</a>, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In 625 he participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Uhud">Battle of Uhud</a> which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims. Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son <a href="Abdu%27l-Rahman%20ibn%20Abu%20Bakr">Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr</a>, who was still non-Muslim and was fighting from the side of the Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. His son later converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and gained fame during the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Syria">Muslim conquest of Syria</a> as a fierce warrior. In the second phase of the battle, <a href="Khalid%20ibn%20al-Walid">Khalid ibn al-Walid</a>’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat. Many Muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war. So did Abu Bakr, however, he was among the first to return according to few <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> Hadith. <a href="Ali%20Ibn%20Abi%20Talib">Ali Ibn Abi Talib</a>, <a href="Talhah">Talhah</a> and a few other Muslims remained guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, majority of <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> and many Sunni Hadith agree to this. Criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished Ali should be put into context: Abu Bakr was a middle aged man during these battles, was not a soldier but a merchant by trade, and had never seen battle before – it may thus be unfair to directly compare him with Ali in this regard.

However it is related that once <a href="Ali">Ali</a> asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men. Everyone replied that Ali was the bravest of all men. Thereupon Ali said:

In Sunni accounts during one such attack, two discs from Abu Bakr's shield penetrated into Muhammad's cheeks. Abu Bakr went forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah requested he leave the matter to him, losing his two <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s during the process. In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr, along with other companions, led Muhammad to a place of safety.

Later in the year Abu Bakr was a part of campaign against the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish tribe of <a href="Banu%20Nadir">Banu Nadir</a>.

In 627 he participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Trench">Battle of the Trench</a> and also in the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Banu%20Qurayza">Invasion of Banu Qurayza</a>. In this battle, Muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector. One of such contingents was under the command of Abu Bakr. The enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch. All such assaults were repulsed. Abu Bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector. To commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where Abu Bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy. The mosque was later known as 'Masjid-i-Siddiq'.

In 628 he participated in <a href="Treaty%20of%20Hudaybiyyah">Treaty of Hudaybiyyah</a> and was made one of the witnesses over the pact.

In 628 he was a part of the Muslim <a href="Battle%20of%20Khaybar">campaign to Khaybar</a>.

In 629 Muhammad sent <a href="%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As">'Amr ibn al-'As</a> to Zaat-ul-Sallasal from where he called for reinforcements and Muhammad sent <a href="Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah">Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah</a>. Commanding an army under him were Abu Bakr and <a href="Umar">Umar</a> and they attacked and defeated the enemy.

In 630 when Muslim armies rushed for the <a href="Conquest%20of%20Mecca">Conquest of Mecca</a>, Abu Bakr was a part of the army. Before the conquest of Mecca his father <a href="Uthman%20Abu%20Quhafa">Uthman Abu Quhafa</a> converted to Islam.

In 630 he was part of <a href="Battle%20of%20Hunayn">Battle of Hunayn</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Ta%27if">Siege of Ta'if</a>. In the Battle of Hunayn as the Muslim army passed through the valley of Hunayn some eleven miles north east of <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> a rain of arrows fell on it let loose by a group of archers of the hostile tribes that lay hid in the mountain pass. Taken unaware the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic. There was considerable confusion, and the camels, horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover. Muhammad stood firm. There were only nine companions around him including Abu Bakr. All the rest had fled. Under the instructions of Muhammad, Abbas shouted at the top of his voice "O Muslims come to the Prophet of Allah". The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad. When the Muslim had gathered in sufficient number, Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy. In the hand-to-hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to <a href="Autas">Autas</a>.

Muhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas. In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught. Finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to Ta'if.

Abu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if. From Autas the Muslim forces set out for Ta'if. The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open. The Muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town, but this did not lead to any tangible results. The Muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate. The enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective.

The siege dragged on for two weeks, and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort. Muhammad held a council of war. Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God would Himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort. The advice was accepted, and in February 630, the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. A few days later Malik bin Auf the commander, came to <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and became a Muslim. Thus the forecast of Abu Bakr came to be fulfilled, and the God Himself arranged for the surrender of Ta'if.

In 630 AD Muhammad decided to lead an expedition to <a href="Tabuk%2C%20Saudi%20Arabia">Tabuk</a> on the <a href="Syrian">Syrian</a> border. In order to finance the expedition Muhammad invited contributions and donations from his followers. <a href="Uthman">Uthman</a> provided ten thousand camels. <a href="Umar">Umar</a> made a liberal contribution. When Muhammad asked him how much he had left for himself and his family he said that he has given one half of his wealth for the cause of God and had left one half for himself and his dependents. Then Abu Bakr came loaded with his contribution and Muhammad put him the same question as to how much wealth he had for himself and his family. Abu Bakr said "I have brought all that I had. I have left Allah and His Prophet for myself and my family". This episode has formed the theme of one of the poems of <a href="Allama%20Iqbal">Allama Iqbal</a>. The last verse of this poem reads:

The call to arms was given at a very critical period. The weather was burning hot. Crops were ripe and ready for harvesting. The journey was long and arduous. Many persons preferred to stay back. In spite of these obstacles and difficulties, an army of thirty thousand persons was raised. The army assembled at Al Jorf outside <a href="Medina">Medina</a>. Muhammad remained at Medina for some time to attend to other affairs, and at Al Jorf Abu Bakr deputised for Muhammad and led the prayers.

The Muslim army reached Tabuk after a weary march. At Tabuk the standard of the army was entrusted to Abu Bakr. There were no <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> forces to meet the Muslims. On coming to know of the advance of the Muslim army the Byzantines had withdrawn their army well within <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. The Muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot. The Byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a> were no longer in the mood to measure swords with the Muslims.

In 631 AD, Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a> according to the new Islamic way. Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates. Abu Bakr had thus the honour of being the first <a href="amir%20al-hajj">Amir-ul-Hajj</a> in the history of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>.

Some time after Abu Bakr and his party had left for Hajj, Muhammad received a revelation about the regulation of the Hajj, and the ordering of relationships with the infidels. It is related that when this revelation came, someone suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr. Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation.

Muhammad summoned Ali, and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at <a href="Mina%2C%20Saudi%20Arabia">Mina</a>. Ali went forth on Muhammad's slit-eared camel, and overtook Abu Bakr. When Ali joined the party, Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them. Ali said that he had not come to replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj, and that his only mission was to convey a special message to the people on behalf of Muhammad.

At Mecca, Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony, and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad. The main points of the proclamation were:


From the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>. Henceforward Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia.

In some quarters an argument is advanced that as on this occasion the proclamation was read by <a href="Ali">Ali</a> on behalf of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, this establishes the precedence of Ali over Abu Bakr, and that therefore when after the death of Muhammad, Abu Bakr became the <a href="Caliph">Caliph</a> in disregard of the claims of Ali, he was a usurper.

On this occasion Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj. Ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation. We can thus say that on this occasion Abu Bakr represented the temporal side, while Ali represented the spiritual side. After the death of Muhammad there was no longer the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime.

Abu Bakr also led one military campaign as commander, known as <a href="Expedition%20of%20Abu%20Bakr%20As-Siddiq">Expedition of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq</a>, which took place in <a href="Najd">Nejd</a>, in July 628 AD (3rd Month 7AH in the <a href="Islamic%20calendar">Islamic calendar</a>). Abu Bakr led a large platoon in Nejd on the order of Muhammad. Many were killed and taken as prisoner. The <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> <a href="Hadith">Hadith</a> collection <a href="Sunan%20Abu%20Dawud">"Sunan Abu Dawud"</a> mentions the event

A short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage, Muhammad became ill. In his fatal illness, Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit. After thanking and praising God he said: "" ("God has given one of His slaves the choice between this world and that which is with Him, and this slave has chosen that which is with God.")

Abu Bakr wept profusely and said, "Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you." The companions were astonished by this (they wondered why Abu Bakr wept), and the people said, "Look at this old man! Allah's Apostle talks about a <a href="Abdullah%20%28name%29">Slave of Allah</a> to whom He has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which is with Him, while he says "our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you". It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant, as Abu Bakr later told the companions.

Muhammad continued:

No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient. Let no Door of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr

The good referred in the first part means the good in the hereafter. Khalil means intimate friend. The door referred to here is the door to the <a href="Al-Masjid%20al-Nabawi">mosque of Muhammad</a>. When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18. When <a href="Muhammad%23Farewell%20pilgrimage%20and%20death">Muhammad died</a> Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs. Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh (a village) on a horse where he had been with his new wife. He dismounted and entered the Prophet's Mosque, but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon 'Aa'isha. He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth (a kind of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered Muhammad's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept, saying, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come upon you." 'Umar was making a sermon to the people saying, "By Allah, he is not dead but has gone to his Lord as <a href="Moses">Musa ibn Imran</a> went and remained hidden from his people for forty days. Musa returned after it was said that he had died. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death."

Abu Bakr arrived and said, "Sit down, O 'Umar!" But 'Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,
"To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad, then Muhammad has passed away, but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die. Allah said, "And Muhammad is but a messenger; the messengers have come before him; if then he dies or is killed will you <a href="Apostasy%20in%20Islam">turn back upon your heels</a>? And whoever turns back upon his heels, he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful." (3.144)

'Umar said, "By Allah, when I heard Abu Bakr reciting it, my legs could not support me and I fell down at the very moment of hearing him reciting it, declaring that Muhammad had passed away."

After Muhammad's death, previously dormant tensions between the Meccan <a href="Immigration">immigrants</a>, the <a href="Muhajirun">Muhajirun</a>, and the Medinan converts, the <a href="Ansar%20%28Islam%29">Ansar</a>, threatened to break out and split the <a href="Ummah">Ummah</a>. Other Arabic tribes also wished to revert to local leadership and split from Medina's control. In some places, people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose Medina, e.g. <a href="Al-Aswad%20Al-Ansi">Al-Aswad Al-Ansi</a> and <a href="Musaylimah">Musaylimah</a>. All of which are events that led to splitting the Muslim community. The Ansar, the leaders of the tribes of Medina, met in a hall or house called <a href="saqifah">saqifah</a>, to discuss whom they would support as their new leader. When Abu Bakr was informed of the meeting, he, <a href="Umar">Umar</a>, <a href="Abu%20Ubaidah%20ibn%20al-Jarrah">Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah</a> and a few others rushed to prevent the Ansar from making a premature decision. Accounts of this meeting vary greatly. All agree that during the meeting Umar declared that Abu Bakr should be the new leader, and declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr, followed by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, and thus Abu Bakr became the first Muslim <a href="caliph">caliph</a>, and the first Muslim given the title "Khalifa-tul-Rasul" ("Successor of messenger of Allah"), a title accepted by Sunni Muslims.

<a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunnis</a> believe that Abu Bakr is the rightful Caliph. The <a href="Twelver">Twelver</a> <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> and the <a href="Ismailism">Ismaili</a> Shia believe that <a href="Ali">Ali</a> should have been the first Caliph. Their main argument is based on their interpretation of <a href="Hadith%20of%20the%20pond%20of%20Khumm">Hadith of the pond of Khumm</a>. However, later a minority, took this concept one step further and also started thinking, what if history took a different course and these ideas were later adopted by some Twelver Shia and institutionalised by the <a href="Safavids">Safavids</a> in the 1500s. For the first time in the history of Islam, the <a href="Safavids">Safavids</a> also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and funded this hierarchy through the collection of <a href="waqf">waqf</a> and <a href="Khums">Khums</a>. Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called "vaqf". They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama the quasi-religious organizations run by <a href="dervish">dervish</a>es ("futuvva"). Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the <a href="mujtahid">mujtahid</a>s and the <a href="seyyed">seyyed</a>s, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian <a href="Iskandar%20Beg%20Munshi">Iskandar Munshi</a>, Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners. From then on many <a href="seyyed">seyyed</a>s also further propagated the idea that Ali should have been the first caliph and that by becoming the first caliph, Abu Bakr had broken the link that proved that they should have more rights. Before that point Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph.

After assuming the office of <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a> Abu Bakr's first address was as follows:

Abu Bakr's Caliphate lasted for 27 months, during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> in the successful <a href="Ridda%20Wars">Ridda Wars</a>. In the last months of his rule, he sent general Khalid ibn al-Walid on conquests <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Persia">against the Sassanid Empire</a> in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">against the Byzantine Empire</a> in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. This would set in motion a historical trajectory (continued later on by <a href="Umar">Umar</a> and <a href="Uthman%20ibn%20Affan">Uthman ibn Affan</a>) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20empires">largest empires in history</a>. He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state, though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate. On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade.

According to <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>, Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the "Qur'an" in written form. It is said that after the hard-won victory over Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama fought in 632, Umar (the later Caliph Umar), saw that many of the Muslims who had memorized the "Qur'an" ( about 300 to 700) had died in battle. Fearing that the Qur'an may be lost or corrupted, Umar requested the Caliph Abu Bakr to authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. After initial hesitation, Abu Bakr made a committee headed by <a href="Zayd%20ibn%20Thabit">Zayd ibn Thabit</a> which included the memorizers of the "Qur'an" and Umar and to collect all verses of the book. After collecting all Qur'anic verses from texts in the possession of various <a href="sahaba">sahaba</a>, Zayd ibn Thabit and members of his committee verified the reading by comparing with those who had memorized the "Qur'an". After they were satisfied that they had not missed out any verse or made any mistakes in reading or writing it down, the text was written down as one single manuscript and presented in codex form to the Caliph Abu Bakr. It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his sahaba (Companions) were still alive.

Prior to his death, Abu Bakr gave this authorized copy of the "Qur'an" to Umar – his successor as caliph. It remained with him throughout his tenure as caliph (10 years). Prior to his death, Umar gave this book to his daughter <a href="Hafsa%20bint%20Umar">Hafsa bint Umar</a>, who was one of the wives of Muhammad. Umar did not nominate his successor on his deathbed, and thus preferred to leave this copy with Hafsa so as not to indicate his personal preference of who would be the next caliph. Later on, it became the basis of <a href="Uthman%20Ibn%20Affan">Uthman Ibn Affan</a>'s definitive text of the "Qur'an" which was published far and wide merely 18 years after the death of Muhammad. Later historians give Uthman Ibn Affan the principal credit for re-verification and publishing the "Qur'an". Twelver Shi'ites reject the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the "Qur'an".

On 23 August 634, Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age.

Abu Bakr developed high <a href="fever">fever</a> and was confined to bed. His illness was prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Realizing his death was near, he sent for <a href="Ali">Ali</a> and requested him to perform his <a href="ghusl">ghusl</a> since Ali had also done it for Muhammad.

Abu Bakr felt that he should nominate his successor so that the issue should not be a cause of dissension among the Muslims after his death, though there was already controversy over Ali not having been appointed.

He appointed Umar as his successor after discussing with some companions. Some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it, due to the tough nature of Umar.

Abu Bakr thus dictated his last testament to <a href="Uthman%20Ibn%20Affan">Uthman Ibn Affan</a> as follows:

Abu Bakr next asked <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a> as to how many pieces of cloth were used for Muhammad's shroud. Aisha said that three pieces had been used. Abu Bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud. On Monday 23 August 634( hijri : 7th of Jamadi-ui- Akhir of the 13th AH), Abu Bakr died. The funeral prayer was led by Umar. He was buried the same night by the side of Muhammad's grave in Aisha's house near Al-Masjid al-Nabawi

Today there are many families which are the descendants of Abu Bakr. Most of them are known by the name <a href="Siddiqui">Siddiqui</a> and al-Bakri Or al-Sideeqi (Al-Bakri) ((In Arabic)). But they are also known by some other names in different localities. For example, in East <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Siddiqis">Siddiqis</a> are usually called <a href="Qallu">Qallu</a>, which means "people of the religion", as they were the first to bring Islam to this area. In <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, they are commonly known as <a href="Sheekhaal">Sheekhaal</a> and they are well respected by other <a href="Somalis">Somali</a> clans. In <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, they are known by the name of <a href="Qureshi">Qureshi</a>. There are also Al-Sedeki or Sedeki families in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Iraq and other places in the Arabia Peninsula. All the descendants of Abu Bakr, their ancestors are: Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr and Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr. The Al-Bakri Family in Egypt are the descendants of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr while the sheekhaal or Fiqi Umar Family found in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya and the Aala bakeri Families found in the Arabia Peninsula are the descendants of Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr.

Abu Bakr became the Caliph on 8 June 632 and he died on 23 August 634. He is considered by sunnis as the greatest of all the companions of Muhammad. Jubayr ibn Mut'im reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter. He asked her to come back later some time. She said, "Tell me if I come later and do not find you?" Jubayr ibn Mut'im said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back. He said, "If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr."

This particular hadith is used by Sunnis and scholars of hadith to demonstrate the superiority of Abu Bakr over all other companions of Muhammad and his rightful succession to Muhammad.

Though the period of his caliphate covers only two years, two months and fifteen days, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time: the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>.

Abu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor. He was the only Caliph in the history of Islam who refunded to the state treasury at the time of his death the entire amount of the allowance that he had drawn during the period of his caliphate.

He is revered for being the first Muslim ruler to establish:

He has the distinction of purchasing the land for <a href="Al-Masjid%20al-Nabawi">Al-Masjid al-Nabawi</a>.

Abu Bakr had given up drinking <a href="wine">wine</a> even in the time before <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. He was the foremost <a href="genealogist">genealogist</a> of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a> and was well accomplished at interpreting <a href="dream">dream</a>s according to Ibn Sirin.

<a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> Muslims also consider Abu Bakr as one of <a href="Hadith%20of%20the%20ten%20promised%20paradise">The Ten Promised Paradise</a> ("al-‘Ashara al-Mubashshara") whom Muhammad had testified were destined for Paradise. He is regarded as the "Successor of Allah's Messenger" ("Khalifa Rasulullah"), and first of the Rightly Guided Caliphs – i.e. <a href="Rashidun">Rashidun</a> and being the rightful successor to Muhammad. Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life. He was always there beside Muhammad at every major event. It was Abu Bakr's wisdom that Muhammad always honored. Abu Bakr is regarded to be among best persons from the followers of Muhammad, as Umar ibn Khattab stated that "If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others."

The <a href="Twelver">Twelver</a> <a href="Shia">Shia</a> (as the main branch of Shia Islam, with 85% of all Shias) believe that <a href="Ali%20ibn%20Abi%20Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> was supposed to assume the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, and that he had been publicly and unambiguously appointed by Muhammad as his successor at <a href="Hadith%20of%20the%20pond%20of%20Khumm">Ghadir Khumm</a>. It is also believed that Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammad's death, in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> against Ali. The Twelver Shi'a do not view Abu Bakr's being with Muhammad in the cave when the two fled Mecca as a meritorious act and indeed find significant criticism of Abu Bakr in the Qur'anic verse of the cave.

Most of Twelver Shia criticize Abu Bakr because, after Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr refused to grant Muhammad's daughter, <a href="Fatimah">Fatimah</a>, the lands of the village of <a href="Fadak">Fadak</a> which she claimed her father had given to her as a gift before his death. He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses, so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father. However, Abu Bakr replied by saying that Muhammad had told him that the prophets of God do not leave as inheritance any worldly possessions and on this basis he refused to give her the lands of Fadak. However, as Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy notes in his book "A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims", Muhammad inherited a maid servant, five camels, and ten sheep. This proves that prophets can receive inheritance, and can pass on inheritance to others as well.

The Twelver Shia accuse him of participating in <a href="Umar%20at%20Fatimah%27s%20house">the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima</a>.

The Twelver Shia believe that Abu Bakr sent <a href="Khalid%20ibn%20Walid">Khalid ibn Walid</a> to crush those who were in favour of <a href="Ali">Ali</a>'s caliphate ("see <a href="Ridda%20Wars">Ridda Wars</a>"). The Twelver Shia strongly refute the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the "Qur'an", claiming that they should have accepted the copy of the book in the possession of Ali.

After the death of Abu Bakr, Ali raised <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Abi%20Bakr">Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr</a>. The Twelver Shia view Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as one of the companions of Ali. When Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the <a href="Ummayads">Ummayads</a>, <a href="Aisha">Aisha</a>, the wife of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and also a renowned scholar of her time, raised and taught her nephew <a href="Qasim%20ibn%20Muhammad%20ibn%20Abu%20Bakr">Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr</a>. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter <a href="Farwah%20bint%20al-Qasim">Farwah bint al-Qasim</a> was married to <a href="Muhammad%20al-Baqir">Muhammad al-Baqir</a> and was the mother of <a href="Jafar%20al-Sadiq">Jafar al-Sadiq</a>. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grand son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grand father of Jafar al-Sadiq. Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph. <a href="Zaidiyyah">Zaydis</a>, the largest group amongst the Shia before the <a href="Safavid%20Dynasty">Safavid Dynasty</a> and currently the second largest group (although its population is only about 5% of all Shia Muslims), believe that on the last hour of <a href="Zayd%20ibn%20Ali">Zayd ibn Ali</a> (the uncle of Jafar al-Sadiq), he was betrayed by the people in Kufa who said to him: "May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and <a href="Umar%20ibn%20al-Khattab">Umar ibn al-Khattab</a>?" Zayd ibn Ali said, "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah".

Ambrose Traversari

Ambrose Traversari, <a href="Camaldolese">O.S.B. Cam.</a>, also referred to as Ambrose of Camaldoli (138620 October 1439), was an <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> <a href="monk">monk</a> and <a href="theology">theologian</a>, who was a prime supporter of the <a href="papal">papal</a> cause in the 15th century. He is honored as a saint by the <a href="Camaldolese">Camaldolese</a> Order.

<a href="Traversari">Traversari</a> was born near <a href="Forl%C3%AC">Forlì</a>, at the village of <a href="Portico%20e%20San%20Benedetto">Portico di Romagna</a> in 1386. At the age of fourteen he entered the <a href="Camaldolese">Camaldolese</a> Order in the Monastery of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20degli%20Angeli%2C%20Florence">St. Mary of the Angels</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, and rapidly became a leading theologian and <a href="Hellenism%20%28Academia%29">Hellenist</a>. In his study of <a href="Greek%20literature">Greek literature</a> his master was <a href="Manuel%20Chrysoloras">Emmanuel Chrysoloras</a>. He worked primarily as a scholar until he became <a href="Prior">Prior</a> General of the Order in 1431.

Ambrose emerged as a leading advocate of the <a href="primacy%20of%20the%20Roman%20Pontiff">primacy of the Roman Pontiff</a>. This attitude he showed clearly when he attended the <a href="Council%20of%20Florence">Council of Basel</a> as legate of <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20IV">Pope Eugene IV</a>, and defended the primacy of the Roman Pontiff and adjured the council not to "rend asunder <a href="Jesus">Christ's</a> seamless robe". He was next sent by the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> to the Emperor <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a> to ask his aid in the pope's efforts to end this Council, which for five years had been encroaching on papal prerogatives. The Pope transferred the Council from <a href="Basel">Basel</a> to <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> on 18 September 1437.

So strong was Ambrose's hostility to some of the delegates that he described Basel as a western <a href="Babylon%20%28New%20Testament%29">Babylon</a>. He likewise supported the pope at Ferrara and Florence, and worked hard in the attempt to reconcile the Eastern and Western Churches. But in this Council, and later, in that of Florence, Ambrose, by his efforts and charity toward some poor Greek bishops, greatly helped to bring about a union of the two Churches, the decree for which, 6 July 1439, he was called on to draw up.

He died soon after. His <a href="calendar%20of%20saints">feastday</a> is celebrated by the Camaldolese Order on 20 November.

According to the author of his biography in the Eleventh edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica": "Ambrose is interesting as typical of the new humanism which was growing up within the church. Thus while among his own colleagues he seemed merely a hypocritical and arrogant priest, in his relations with his brother humanists, such as <a href="Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo de' Medici</a>, he appeared as the student of classical antiquities and especially of Greek theological authors".

His works include a treatise on the Holy <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, one on the <a href="Trinity%20%28Christianity%29%23Eternal%20generation%20and%20procession">Procession of the Holy Spirit</a>, many lives of saints, as well as a history of his term as Prior General of the Camaldolese. He also translated from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> a life of Saint <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> (<a href="Venice">Venice</a>, 1533); the Spiritual Wisdom of <a href="Joannes%20Moschus">John Moschus</a>; "<a href="The%20Ladder%20of%20Divine%20Ascent">The Ladder of Divine Ascent</a>" of Saint <a href="John%20Climacus">John Climacus</a> (Venice, 1531), P.G., LXXXVIII. Between 1424 and 1433 he worked on the translation of the "<a href="Lives%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Eminent%20Philosophers">Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</a>" by <a href="Diogenes%20La%C3%ABrtius">Diogenes Laërtius</a>, which came to be widely circulated in manuscript form and was published at <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in 1472 (the first printed edition of the "Lives"; the Greek text was printed only in 1533). He also translated four books against the errors of the Greeks, by <a href="Manuel%20Kalekas">Manuel Kalekas</a>, <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, a <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> <a href="friar">friar</a> (<a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, 1608), P.G., CLII, col. 13-661, a work known only through Ambrose's translation.

He also translated many homilies of Saint John Chrysostom; the treatise of the <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a> on the celestial hierarchy; <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">St. Basil's</a> treatise on <a href="virginity">virginity</a>; thirty nine discourses of St. <a href="Ephrem%20the%20Syrian">Ephrem the Syrian</a>, and many other works of the <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers</a> and writers of the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Church</a>. <a href="Jean%20Mabillon">Dom Mabillon's</a> "Letters and Orations of St. Ambrose of Camaldoli" was published at Florence, 1759.

Ambrosians

Ambrosians are members of one of the religious brotherhoods which at various times since the 14th century have sprung up in and around <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and also a 16th-century sect of <a href="Anabaptist%20Ambrosians">Anabaptist Ambrosians</a>.

Only the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosians, the Fratres S. Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a <a href="Papal%20bull">bull</a> of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XI">Pope Gregory XI</a> addressed to the <a href="monk">monk</a>s of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.

Saint <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a>, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found <a href="Religious%20orders%23Catholic%20tradition">religious orders</a>, though he took an interest in the <a href="Christian%20monasticism">monastic life</a> and watched over its beginnings in his <a href="diocese">diocese</a>, providing for the needs of a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> outside the walls of Milan, as <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Saint Augustine</a> recounts in his "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>". Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: "De virginibus", "De viduis", "De virginitate", "De institutione virginis", "De exhortatione virginitatis", and "De lapsu virginis consecratae". Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women.

It is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.

The first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some priests. In 1375 <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XI">Pope Gregory XI</a> gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name "Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus" and adopted a habit consisting of a brown <a href="tunic">tunic</a>, <a href="scapular">scapular</a>, and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of <a href="prior">prior</a> who was then instituted by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Milan">Archbishop of Milan</a>. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the <a href="Ambrosian%20Rite">Ambrosian Rite</a>. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In 1441 <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20IV">Pope Eugene IV</a> merged them into one congregation called "Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus", made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two "visitors".

Saint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. In 1589 <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a> united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the "Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life" (or "Apostolini" or "Brothers of St. Barnabas"), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union was confirmed by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a> in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20X">Pope Innocent X</a> in 1650.

The Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the <a href="Ambrosian%20Rite">Ambrosian Rite</a>, but were independent in government. <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20IV">Pope Sixtus IV</a> gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life. Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo.

Another group of cloistered "Nuns of St Ambrose", also called the Annunciatae (Italian: "Annunziate") of Lombardy or "Sisters of St Marcellina", were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint <a href="Catharine%20Fieschi%20Adorno">Catharine Fieschi Adorno</a>, who died on September 14, 1510.

In some sense also "Ambrosians" are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St <a href="Charles%20Borromeo">Charles Borromeo</a>, Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of "Priests of Peace". In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of "Oblates of St. Ambrose." They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon I</a> in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of "Oblates of St. Charles" and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the "Oblates of St Charles", established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.

Today, the Oblates of St. Ambrose and of St. Charles is divided into four "families" or groups:


In 1980 there were 17 missionaries Rho, 24 vicars, 160 diocesan and 60 laymen, all in the archdiocese of Milan.

Ambrosiaster

Ambrosiaster is the name given to the writer of a commentary on St <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Paul's</a> epistles, "brief in words but weighty in matter," and valuable for the criticism of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> text of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. The commentary itself was written during the papacy of <a href="Pope%20Damasus%20I">Pope Damasus I</a>, that is, between 366 and 384, and is considered an important document of the Latin text of Paul before the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> of <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, and of the interpretation of Paul prior to <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>.

This commentary was erroneously attributed for a long time to St <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a>. In 1527, though, <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> threw doubt on the accuracy of ascribing the authorship of this document to Ambrose. Erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name "Ambrosiaster" (literally in Latin: "would be-Ambrose") to describe its author. The credit for this nickname should go to the Maurists, as René Hoven has shown. The name has remained with the unknown author. Attempts to identify this Ambrosiaster with known authors has continued, but with no success. Because <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a> cites Ambrosiaster's commentary on Romans 5.12 under the name of "Hilary", many critics have attempted to identify Ambroasiaster with one of the many writers named "Hilary" active in the period. In 1899, <a href="Germain%20Morin">Germain Morin</a> suggested that the writer was Isaac, a converted Jew and writer of a tract on the Trinity and Incarnation, who was exiled to <a href="Spain">Spain</a> in 378-380 and then relapsed to <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>; but he afterwards abandoned this theory of the authorship in favour of <a href="Decimus%20Hilarianus%20Hilarius">Decimus Hilarianus Hilarius</a>, proconsul of <a href="North%20Africa%20during%20the%20Classical%20Period">Africa</a> in 377. Alternatively, <a href="Paolo%20Angelo%20Ballerini">Paolo Angelo Ballerini</a> attempted to sustain the traditional attribution of the work to Ambrose, in his complete edition of that Father's work. This is extremely problematic, though, since it would require Ambrose to have written the book before he became a bishop, and then added to it in later years, incorporating later remarks of <a href="Hilary%20of%20Poitiers">Hilary of Poitiers</a> on Romans. No identifications, therefore, have acquired lasting popularity with scholars, and his identity remains a mystery.

Several other minor works have been attributed to this same author, along with a lengthy collection of exegetical and polemical tractates, the "Quaestiones Veteris et Novi Testamenti," which manuscripts have traditionally ascribed to <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a>. In 1905, Alexander Souter established that this work should also be attributed to Ambrosiaster. Fragments of several other works have been ascribed with some certainty to Ambrosiaster: a commentary on Matthew 24, a discussion of the parable of the three measures of flour into which a woman placed yeast, and a treatment of Peter's denial and the arrest of Jesus in Gethsemane. The attribution of other fragments to Ambrosiaster, though, is more tentative.

Despite the elusive identity of Ambrosiaster, several facts about him can be established. Internal evidence suggests he was active at Rome during the reign of Pope Damasus (366–384), and almost certainly a member of the Roman clergy. There are strong indications he objected to Jerome's efforts to revise the Old Latin versions of the Gospels, and that he was critical of Jerome's activity among ascetic women at Rome. Ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in Judaism and often notes that Christian practices derive from Jewish tradition.

Ambrosius Aurelianus

Ambrosius Aurelianus (; <a href="Anglicised">Anglicised</a> as Ambrose Aurelian and called Aurelius Ambrosius in the "<a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>" and elsewhere) was a <a href="King%20of%20the%20Britons">war leader</a> of the <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> who won an important battle against the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> in the 5th century, according to <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>. He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons, beginning with the 9th-century "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>". Eventually he was transformed into the uncle of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>, the brother of Arthur's father <a href="Uther%20Pendragon">Uther Pendragon</a>, and predeceases them both.

Due to Gildas' description of him, Ambrosius is one of the figures called the <a href="Last%20of%20the%20Romans">Last of the Romans</a>.

Ambrosius Aurelianus is one of the few people that <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a> identifies by name in his sermon "<a href="De%20Excidio%20et%20Conquestu%20Britanniae">De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae</a>", and the only one named from the 5th century. "De Excidio" is considered the oldest extant British document about the so-called Arthurian period of <a href="Sub-Roman%20Britain">Sub-Roman Britain</a>. Following the destructive assault of the Saxons, the survivors gather together under the leadership of Ambrosius, who is described as:

Some basic information on Ambrosius can be deduced from the brief passage: Ambrosius was possibly of high birth and very likely a <a href="Christian">Christian</a> (Gildas says that he won his battles "with <a href="God">God</a>'s help"). Ambrosius' parents were slain by the Saxons and he was among the few survivors of their initial invasion.

According to Gildas, Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders. However, this victory was not decisive: "Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [meaning the Romano-British inhabitants] were victorious."

Two points in Gildas' description have attracted much scholarly commentary. The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius' family "had worn the purple". <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>s and male <a href="patrician%20%28Ancient%20Rome%29">Patricians</a> wore clothes with a purple band to denote their class so the reference to purple may be to an aristocratic heritage. <a href="Tribune%23Tribune%20of%20the%20soldiers">Roman military tribunes</a> ("tribuni militum"), senior officers in Roman legions, wore a similar purple band so the reference may be to a family background of military leadership. The tradition was old as the <a href="toga">toga</a>s and <a href="pallium%20%28Roman%20cloak%29">pallia</a> of already ancient senators and tribunes were trimmed with the purple band. In the church "the purple" is a euphemism for blood and therefore "wearing the purple" may be a reference to martyrdom or a bishop's robe. In addition, in the later <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> both <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman consul</a>s and governors of consular rank also wore clothes with a purple fringe. The "<a href="Notitia%20Dignitatum">Notitia Dignitatum</a>", a Roman catalogue of official posts, lists four or five provincial governors in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> and two of them were of consular rank. One was the governor of <a href="Maxima%20Caesariensis">Maxima Caesariensis</a> and the other that of <a href="Valentia%20%28Roman%20Britain%29">Valentia</a>. The parent who wore the purple may well have been one of these governors, whose names were not recorded.

It has been suggested by historian Alex Woolf that Ambrosius may have been related to the 5th century Romano-British usurpers <a href="Marcus%20%28usurper%29">Marcus</a> or <a href="Gratian%20%28usurper%29">Gratian</a> – Woolf expresses a preference based on nomenclature for Marcus. Frank D. Reno, an Arthurian scholar, has instead argued that the name "Aurelianus" indicates the possible descent of Ambrosius from the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20emperors">Roman emperor</a> <a href="Aurelian">Lucius Domitius Aurelianus</a> (Aurelian, reigned 270-275). Aurelian's military campaigns included the conquest of the <a href="Gallic%20Empire">Gallic Empire</a>. N. J. Higham suggests that Ambrosius may have been distantly related to imperial families of the late <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, such as the <a href="Theodosian%20dynasty">Theodosian dynasty</a>. Branches of this particular dynasty were known to be active in western Roman provinces like <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>.

<a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> instead focuses on the name "Ambrosius". In his view, it seems to suggest connection to <a href="Ambrose">Saint Ambrosius</a>, a fourth-century <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milan">Bishop of Milan</a>, who also served as consular governor in areas of <a href="Roman%20Italy">Roman Italy</a>. The father of the Bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Gaul">Praetorian prefect of Gaul</a> named Aurelius Ambrosius, whose areas included Britain, though some modern scholars doubt that Saint Ambrosius was related to this man (instead identifying his father with an official named Uranius mentioned in an extract from the <a href="Theodosian%20Code">Theodosian Code</a>). Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii. Tim Venning points out that the name "Aurelianus" could be the result of a <a href="Adoption%20in%20ancient%20Rome">Roman adoption</a>. When a boy was adopted into a new <a href="gens">gens</a> (clan), he received the family names of his new family, plus an additional <a href="cognomen">cognomen</a> indicating his descent from his original gens/family. The additional cognomen often had the form "-anus". When <a href="Augustus">Gaius Octavius</a> from gens <a href="Octavia%20%28gens%29">Octavia</a> was adopted into the <a href="Julii%20Caesares">Julii Caesares</a> family, his new name became Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. In this case, Ambrosius may have been a member of gens <a href="Aurelia%20%28gens%29">Aurelia</a> who was adopted by another gens/family. His original name Aurelius became Aurelianus.

The second question is the meaning of the word "avita": Gildas could have meant "ancestors", or intended it to mean more specifically "grandfather" – thus indicating Ambrosius lived about a generation before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Badon">Battle of Badon</a>. Lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions.

N. J. Higham wrote a book on Gildas and the literary tropes that he used. He has suggested that Gildas may have had considerable motives for placing attention to Ambrosius. He was not attempting to write a historical biography of the man, according to Higham, but setting him as an example to his contemporaries. It was essential to the philosophy of Gildas that Briton leaders who achieved victory over the <a href="barbarian">barbarian</a>s were only able to do so because of divine aid. And only those who had superior Christian virtues were deserving of this aid. Ambrosius Aurelianus was apparently known for at least one such victory over the barbarians. In order to fit him in his worldview, Gildas was almost required to feature the former warrior as a man of exceptional virtues and obedience to God. He was made to fit Gildas' version of a model leader.

Higham also suggests that the Roman lineage of Ambrosius was highlighted for a reason. Gildas was apparently intentionally connecting him with the legitimate authority and military virtues of the Romans. He was also contrasting him with the subsequent Briton rulers whose reigns lacked in such legitimacy.

Gildas is a primary source for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Badon">Battle of Badon</a>, yet he never mentions the names of the combatants. Therefore, we cannot know if Ambrosius Aurelianus or his successors took part in the battle. The names of the Saxon leaders in the battle are also not recorded.

The identities of Ambrosius' descendants are unknown, since Gildas never identifies them by name. It is safe to assume that they were Gildas' contemporaries and known to the author. Higham suggests that they were prominent figures of the time. Their lineage and identities were probably sufficiently familiar to his intended audience that they did not have to be named. The work portrays Ambrosius' descendants as inferior to their ancestor as part of his criticism on rulers of his time, according to Higham. Those criticized were likely aware that the vitriol was intended for them, but probably would not challenge a work offering such a glowing report of their illustrious ancestor.

Mike Ashley suggests that the descendants of Ambrosius could include other people named by Gildas. He favors the inclusion in this category of one <a href="Aurelius%20Conanus">Aurelius Caninus</a> ("Aurelius the little dog" or "Aurelius the whelp"), whom Gildas accuses of <a href="parricide">parricide</a>, <a href="fornication">fornication</a>, <a href="adultery">adultery</a>, and warmongering. His name "Aurelius" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname "Caninus" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named <a href="Conan%20%28disambiguation%29">Conan</a>/<a href="Cynan">Cynan</a>/<a href="Kenan%20%28name%29">Kenan</a>. Some identify him with <a href="Cynan%20Garwyn">Cynan Garwyn</a>, a 6th-century <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">King of Powys</a>, though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him. Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>. Caninus, in this view, might be <a href="Conomor">Conomor</a> ("Great Dog"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from <a href="Domnon%C3%A9e">Domnonée</a>, an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from <a href="Dumnonia">Dumnonia</a>. He might be remembered in British legend as <a href="Mark%20of%20Cornwall">Mark of Cornwall</a>.

Gildas primarily features the Saxons as barbarian raiders; their invasions involved a slow and difficult process of military conquest. By AD 500, possibly the time described by Gildas, <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> controlled the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, and coastal areas of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. The rest of the former <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> was still under the control of the local Britons. Gildas also mentions depopulation of cities and this probably reflects historical facts. <a href="Londinium">Londinium</a>, once a major city, was completely abandoned during the 5th century.

<a href="Bede">Bede</a> follows Gildas' account of Ambrosius in his "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", but in his "Chronica Majora" he dates Ambrosius' victory to the reign of the <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Emperor Zeno</a> (474–491).

Bede's treatment of the 5th century history of Great Britain is not particularly valuable as a source. Until about the year 418, Bede could choose between several historical sources and often followed the writings of <a href="Orosius">Orosius</a>. Following the end of Orosius' history, Bede apparently lacked other available sources and relied extensively on Gildas. Entries from this period tend to be close paraphrases of Gildas' account with mostly stylistic changes. Bede's account of Ambrosius Aurelianus has been translated as following:

Bede does not mention the descendants of Ambrosius Aurelianus, nor their supposed degeneracy.

The "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>", attributed to <a href="Nennius">Nennius</a>, preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius. Despite the traditional attribution, the authorship of the work and the period of its writing are open questions for modern historians. There are several extant manuscript versions of the work, varying in details. The most important ones have been dated to between the 9th and the 11th century. Some modern scholars think it unlikely that the work was composed by a single writer or compiler, suggesting that it may have taken centuries to reach its final form, though this theory is not conclusive.

In Chapter 31, we are told that <a href="Vortigern">Vortigern</a> ruled in fear of Ambrosius. This is the first mention of Ambrosius in the work. According to Frank D. Reno, this would indicate that Ambrosius' influence was formidable, since Vortigern considered him more of a threat than northern invaders and attempts to restore Roman rule in Britain. The chapter relates events following the end of Roman rule in Britain and preceding Vortigern's alliance with the Saxons.

The most significant appearance of Ambrosius is the story about Ambrosius, Vortigern, and the two <a href="dragon">dragon</a>s beneath <a href="Dinas%20Emrys">Dinas Emrys</a>, "Fortress of Ambrosius" in Chapters 40–42. In this account, Ambrosius is still an adolescent but has supernatural powers. He intimidates Vortigern and the royal <a href="Magician%20%28fantasy%29">magicians</a>. When it is revealed that Ambrosius is the son of a <a href="Roman%20consul">Roman consul</a>, Vortigern is convinced to <a href="Cession">cede</a> to the younger man the castle of Dinas Emrys and all the kingdoms in the western part of Britain. Vortigern then retreats to the north, in an area called Gwynessi. This story was later retold with more detail by <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> in his fictionalized "<a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>", conflating the personage of Ambrosius with the Welsh tradition of <a href="Merlin">Myrddin</a> the visionary, known for <a href="Oracle">oracular</a> utterances that foretold the coming victories of the native <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic inhabitants of Britain over the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a> and the <a href="Normans">Normans</a>. Geoffrey also introduces him into the "Historia" under the name Aurelius Ambrosius as one of three sons of <a href="Constantine%20III%20%28western%20emperor%29">Constantine III</a>, along with <a href="Constans%20II%20%28usurper%29">Constans II</a> and <a href="Uther%20Pendragon">Uther Pendragon</a>.

In Chapter 48, Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as "<a href="Kings%20of%20the%20Britons">king among all the kings of the British nation</a>". The chapter records that Pascent, the son of Vortigern, was granted rule over the regions of <a href="Buellt">Buellt</a> and <a href="Gwrtheyrnion">Gwrtheyrnion</a> by Ambrosius. Finally, in Chapter 66, various events are dated from a <a href="Battle%20of%20Guoloph">Battle of Guoloph</a> (often identified with <a href="Middle%20Wallop">Wallop</a>, ESE of <a href="Amesbury">Amesbury</a> near <a href="Salisbury%2C%20England">Salisbury</a>), which is said to have been between Ambrosius and Vitolinus. The author dates this battle as taking place 12 years from the reign of Vortigern.

It is not clear how these various traditions about Ambrosius relate to each other, or whether they come from the same tradition; it is very possible that these references are to different men with the same name. Frank D. Reno points out that the works call all these men "Ambrosius"/"Emrys". The <a href="cognomen">cognomen</a> "Aurelianus" is never used. The "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>" dates the battle of Guoloph to "the twelfth year of Vortigern", by which the year 437 seems to be meant. This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas says was commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus.

The text never identifies who Ambrosius's father is, just gives his title as a Roman consul. When an adolescent Ambrosius speaks of his father, there is no suggestion that this father is deceased. The boy is not identified as an orphan. The exact age of Ambrosius is not given in his one encounter with Vortigern. Frank D. Reno suggests that he might be as young as 13 years old, barely a teenager.

It is impossible to know to what degree Ambrosius actually wielded political power, and over what area. Ambrosius and Vortigern are shown as being in conflict in the "Historia Brittonum", and some historians have suspected that this preserves a historical core of the existence of two parties in opposition to one another, one headed by Ambrosius and the other by Vortigern. <a href="J.%20N.%20L.%20Myres">J. N. L. Myres</a> built upon this suspicion and speculated that belief in <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagianism</a> reflected an actively provincial outlook in Britain and that Vortigern represented the Pelagian party, while Ambrosius led the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> one. Subsequent historians accepted Myers' speculation as fact, creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail. Yet a simpler alternative interpretation of the conflict between these two figures is that the "Historia Brittonum" is preserving traditions hostile to the purported descendants of Vortigern, who at this time were a ruling house in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">Powys</a>. This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the "Historia Brittonum", which include his alleged practice of <a href="incest">incest</a>.

The identity is somewhat obscure of Ambrosius' last mentioned enemy Vitalinus. Various manuscripts of the "Historia" and translations render his name "Guitolin", "Guitolini", "Guitholini", and "Vitalinus". He is mentioned in chapter 49 as one of four sons of <a href="Gloiu">Gloiu</a> and co-founder of the city of <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>. No other background information is given. There are theories that Gloiu is also the father of Vortigern, but the genealogy is obscure and no supporting primary text can be found. There have been further attempts to identify Vitalinus with a pro-Vortigern or anti-Roman faction in Britain, opposed to the rise of the Romano-British Ambrosius. However, this is rendered problematic since Vitalinus seems to also have a Romano-British name. The traditional view of pro-Roman and pro-Briton factions active in this period might oversimplify a more complex situation.

Ambrosius appears briefly in the "<a href="Gesta%20Regum%20Anglorum">Gesta Regum Anglorum</a>" ("Deeds of the Kings of the English") by <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>. Despite its name, the work attempted to reconstruct British history in general by drawing together the varying accounts of Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and various chroniclers. The work features Ambrosius as the apparent employer of <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthur</a>. The relative passage has been translated as following:

William swiftly shifts attention from Ambrosius to Arthur, and proceeds to narrate Arthur's supposed victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Badon">Battle of Badon</a>. The narrative is probably the first to connect Ambrosius and Arthur. William had to reconcile the accounts of Gildas and Bede who implied that Ambrosius was connected to the battle, and that of Nennius which clearly stated that it was Arthur who was connected to the battle. He solved the apparent discrepancy by connecting both of them to it. Ambrosius as the king of the Britons and Arthur as his most prominent general and true victor of the battle.

Ambrosius Aurelianus appears in later pseudo-chronicle tradition beginning with <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>'s "<a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>" with the slightly garbled name "Aurelius Ambrosius", now presented as son of a King Constantine. King Constantine's eldest son Constans is murdered at Vortigern's instigation, and the two remaining sons (Ambrosius and Uther, still very young) are quickly hustled into exile in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>. (This does not fit with Gildas' account, in which Ambrosius' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings.) Later, the two brothers return from exile with a large army when Vortigern's power has faded. They destroy Vortigern and become friends with <a href="Merlin">Merlin</a>. They go on to defeat the Saxon leader <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengist</a> in two battles at Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>) and <a href="Conisbrough">Cunengeburg</a>. Hengist is executed and Ambrosius becomes king of Britain. However, he is poisoned by his enemies, and Uther succeeds him. The text identifies the poisoner as Eopa.

Judgements tend to vary wildly of the value of Geoffrey as both a historian and a literary storyteller. He has been praised for giving us detailed information about an otherwise obscure period and possibly preserving information from lost sources, and condemned for an excessive use of <a href="artistic%20license">artistic license</a> and possibly inventing stories wholecloth. 

Geoffrey changed the word "Aurelianus" to "<a href="Aurelia%20%28gens%29">Aurelius</a>", which is the <a href="Roman%20naming%20conventions%23Nomen">name</a> of a Roman <a href="gens">gens</a>. Geoffrey retains the story of Emrys and the dragons from Nennius, but identifies the figure with <a href="Merlin">Merlin</a>. Merlin is Geoffrey's version of a historical figure known as <a href="Myrddin%20Wyllt">Myrddin Wyllt</a>. Myrddin is only mentioned once in the "<a href="Annales%20Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a>", at an entry dated to 573. The name of Merlin is given in Latin as Ambrosius Merlinus. "Merlinus" may have been intended as the <a href="agnomen">agnomen</a> of a Roman or Romano-British individual like Ambrosius.

Elements of Ambrosius Aurelianus, the traditional warrior king, are used by Geoffrey for other characters. Ambrosius' supposed supernatural powers are passed to Merlin. Geoffrey's Aurelius Ambrosius rises to the throne but dies early, passing the throne to a previously unknown brother called <a href="Uther%20Pendragon">Uther Pendragon</a>. The role of warrior king is shared by Uther and his son <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthur</a>.

Geoffrey also uses the character <a href="Gloiu">Gloiu</a>, father of Vitalinus/Vitolinus, derived from Nennius. He names this character as a son of Claudius and appointed by his father as Duke of the <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a>. His predecessor as Duke is called <a href="Arvirargus">Arvirargus</a>. Assuming that Claudius and Arvirargus are supposed to be contemporaries, then this Claudius is the Roman emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius I</a> (reigned 41–54). It seems unlikely that Claudius would have living grandsons in the 5th century, four centuries following his death. Reno suggests that <a href="Claudius%20Gothicus">Claudius II</a> (reigned 268–270) would be a more likely "Claudius" to have living descendants in the 5th century.

Geoffrey for the first time gives a genealogy of Ambrosius. He is supposedly a paternal nephew of <a href="Aldroenus">Aldroenus</a>, King of Brittany, son of <a href="Constantine%20III%20%28Western%20Roman%20Emperor%29">Constantine</a> and an unnamed Briton noblewoman, adoptive grandson (on his mother's side) of Guthelinus/Vitalinus, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, younger brother of <a href="Constans%20II%20%28usurper%29">Constans</a> and older brother of <a href="Uther%20Pendragon">Uther Pendragon</a>. Ambrosius and Uther are supposedly raised by their adoptive maternal grandfather Guthelinus/Vitalinus. It is not explicitly covered in Geoffrey's narrative, but this genealogy makes Constantine and his children descendants of <a href="Conan%20Meriadoc">Conan Meriadoc</a>, legendary founder of the line of Kings of Brittany. Conan is also featured in the "Historia Regum Britanniae", where he is appointed king by Roman emperor <a href="Magnus%20Maximus">Magnus Maximus</a> (reigned 383-388).

Constantine's reign is placed by Geoffrey as following the <a href="Groans%20of%20the%20Britons">Groans of the Britons</a> mentioned by Gildas. Constantine is reported killed by a <a href="Picts">Pict</a> and his reign is followed by a brief succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included all three sons of Constantine, but there were problems for their eventual rise to the throne. Constans was a <a href="monk">monk</a>, and Ambrosius and Uther were <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">underage</a> and still in their <a href="Bassinet">cradle</a>. The crisis is resolved when <a href="Vortigern">Vortigern</a> places Constans on the throne, and then serves as his chief <a href="adviser">adviser</a> and <a href="power%20behind%20the%20throne">power behind the throne</a>. When Constans is killed by the Picts serving as bodyguards of Vortigern, Vortigern feigns anguish and has the killers executed. Ambrosius is still underage and Vortigern rises to the throne.

The chronology offered by Geoffrey for the early life of Ambrosius contradicts Gildas and Nennius, and is also internally inconsistent. The <a href="Groans%20of%20the%20Britons">Groans of the Britons</a> involves an appeal by the Britons to Roman consul "Agitius". This person has been identified with <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Flavius Aetius</a> (d. 454), <a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a> ("master of soldiers") of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> and consul of the year 446. The Groans are generally dated to the 440s and 450s, preceding the death of Aetius. If Geoffrey's Constantine rose to the throne immediately following the Groans, this would place his reign in this period. Geoffrey gives a 10-year-reign for Constantine and his marriage lasts just as long. However the eldest son Constans is clearly older than 10-years-old by the time his father dies. He is already an adult candidate of the throne and has had time to follow a monastic career. Even assuming there is a time gap between the death of Constantine and the adulthood of Constans, his younger brothers 
have not aged at all in the narrative.
Geoffrey's narrative has an underage Ambrosius, if not a literal <a href="infant">infant</a>, in the 460s. Accounts deriving from Gildas and Nennius place Ambrosius in the prime of his life in the same decade. Most telling is that Geoffrey has Vortigern rising to the throne in the 460s. Nennius places the rise of Vortigern in the year 425, and Vortigern is entirely absent in chronologies of the 460s. Suggesting that he was deceased by that time.

Geoffrey's narrative includes as a major character <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengist</a>, as leader of the Saxons. He is also featured as the father of Queen <a href="Rowena">Rowena</a> and father-in-law of Vortigern. Other Saxon characters in the narrative tend to receive less attention by the writer, but their names tend to correspond to Anglo-Saxons known from other sources. Henginst's supposed son Octa is apparently <a href="Octa%20of%20Kent">Octa of Kent</a>, a 6th-century ruler variously connected to Hengist as a son or descendant. The other son, Ebissa, is more difficult to identify. He might correspond to kinsmen of Hengist variously identified as "Ossa", "<a href="Oisc%20of%20Kent">Oisc</a>", and "Aesc". A minor Saxon character called "Cherdic" is probably <a href="Cerdic%20of%20Wessex">Cerdic of Wessex</a>, though elsewhere Geoffrey calls the same king "Cheldric". He actually may appear under three different names in the narrative, since Geoffrey elsewhere calls the interpreter of Hengist "Ceretic", a variant of the same name.

Geoffrey, in the last chapters featuring Vortigern, has the king served by <a href="magician%20%28fantasy%29">magicians</a>. This detail derives from Nennius, though Nennius was talking about Vortigern's "wise men". They may not have been magic users but advisers. Vortigern's encounter with Emrys/Merlin takes place in this part of the narrative. Merlin warns Vortigern that Ambrosius and Uther have already sailed for Britain and are soon to arrive, apparently to claim his throne. Ambrosius soon arrives at the head of the army and is crowned king. He besieges Vortigern at the castle of "Genoreu", which is identified with Nennius' "Cair Guorthigirn" ("<a href="Caer">Fort</a> <a href="Vortigern">Vortigern</a>") and the <a href="British%20hillforts">hillfort</a> at <a href="The%20Doward">Little Doward</a>. Ambrosius burns the castle down and Vortigern dies with it.

Having killed Vortigern, Ambrosius next turns his attention to Hengist. Despite the fact that no earlier military actions of Ambrosius are recorded, the Saxons have already heard of his bravery and battle prowess. They immediately retreat beyond the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. Hengist soon amasses a massive army to face Ambrosius. His army counts 200,000 men and Ambrosius' only 10,000 men. He marches south and the first battle between the two armies takes place in Maisbeli, where Ambrosius emerges the victor. It is unclear what location Geoffrey had in mind. Maisbeli translates to "the field of Beli", and could be related to the <a href="Beli%20Mawr">Beli Mawr</a> of Welsh legend and/or the <a href="Celtic%20deities">Celtic god</a> <a href="Belenus">Belenus</a>. Alternatively it could be a field where the <a href="Beltane">Beltane</a> festival was celebrated. Geoffrey could derive the name from a similar-sounding toponym. For example, <a href="Meicen">Meicen</a> of the <a href="Hen%20Ogledd">Hen Ogledd</a> ("Old North"), traditionally identified with <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">Hatfield</a>.

Following his defeat, Hengist retreats towards Cunungeburg. Geoffrey probably had in mind <a href="Conisbrough">Conisbrough</a>, not far from Hatfield. Ambrosius leads his army against the new position of the Saxons. The second battle is more evenly fought, and Hengist has a chance to achieve victory. However, Ambrosius receives reinforcements from Brittany and the tide of the battle turns in favor of the Britons. Hengist himself is captured by his old enemy <a href="Eldol%2C%20Consul%20of%20Gloucester">Eldol, Consul of Gloucester</a> and decapitated. Soon after the battle, the surviving Saxon leaders Octa and Eosa submit themselves to Ambrosius' rule. He pardons them and grants them an area near <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The area is not named, but Geoffrey could be basing this on <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a>, a real Ango-Saxon kingdom covering areas in the modern borders of Scotland and England.

Geoffrey closely connects the deaths of Vortigern and Hengist, which are elsewhere poorly recorded. Vortigern historically died in the 450s, and various dates for the death of Hengist have been proposed, between the 450s and the 480s. <a href="Octa%20of%20Kent">Octa of Kent</a>, the supposed son and heir of Hengist, was still alive in the 6th century and seems to belong to a later historical era than his father. The ruling family of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kingdom of Kent</a> were called the Oiscingas, a term identifying them as descendants of <a href="Oisc%20of%20Kent">Oisc of Kent</a>, not of Hengist. In effect, none of them was likely a literal son of Hengist and their relation to Hengist may have been a later invention. Geoffrey did not invent the connection, but his sources here were likely legendary in nature.

Following his victories and the end of the wars, Ambrosius organizes the burial of killed nobles at Kaercaradduc. Geoffrey identifies this otherwise unknown location with Caer-Caradog (<a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a>). Ambrosius wants a permanent memorial for the slain and assigns the task to Merlin. The result is the so-called Giants' Ring. Its location in the vicinity of Salisbury has led to its identification with <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, though Geoffrey never uses that term. Stonehenge is closer to <a href="Amesbury">Amesbury</a> than Salisbury. The ring formation of the monument could equally apply to <a href="Avebury">Avebury</a>, the largest stone circle in Europe.

In Welsh legend and texts, Ambrosius appears as "Emrys Wledig" (Emperor Ambrose). The term "Wledig" is a title used by senior royal and military commanders who have achieved notable success. The term is mostly used for famous figures such as <a href="Cunedda">Cunedda</a>, though a few obscure figures have been given the title.

In <a href="Robert%20de%20Boron">Robert de Boron</a>'s "Merlin" he is called simply "Pendragon" and his younger brother is named "Uter", which he changes to "Uterpendragon" after the death of the elder sibling. This is probably a confusion that entered oral tradition from <a href="Wace">Wace</a>'s "<a href="Roman%20de%20Brut">Roman de Brut</a>". Wace usually only refers to "li roi" ("the king") without naming him, and someone has taken an early mention of Uther's epithet "Pendragon" as the name of his brother.

Peter Korrel supports the view that Ambrosius Aurelianus and <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> might be the same person, a theory also supported by others debating the <a href="historicity%20of%20King%20Arthur">historicity of King Arthur</a>. He points that all accounts about Ambrosius can be traced back to Gildas and all accounts about Arthur can be traced back to Nennius, with the two figures being very similar.

Both figures have been connected to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Badon">Battle of Badon</a> and have been portrayed as its sole hero. Their identity as kings is a later addition; they are originally depicted as leaders of the Britons in their wars with the Saxons. The Latin term <a href="Dux%23Post-Roman%20uses">dux bellorum</a> can be applied to both of them. Both figures are of Roman descent. With Ambrosius, this is featured in both his name and stated background. With Arthur, this is implied, since the name seems to be derived from <a href="Artorius">Artorius</a>, the name of a minor Roman <a href="gens">gens</a>.

Both figures are known for their <a href="courage">valour</a>. Ambrosius is featured as the one who manages to re-assemble the desperate Britons, encourage them to fight once again, and make a stand against the seemingly superior enemy. This would require personal courage. Arthur is reported to have single-handedly faced numerically superior enemies. Both figures are devout <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s whose victories are attributed to divine protection. In both cases, the Battle of Badon seems to be the final victory of a long war. Bedas states that Ambrosius started the war against the Saxons and both factions had victories and losses until the war concluded in the Battle of Badon. In Arthurian narratives, Arthur is said to have led the Britons in 12 victories, with the Battle of Badon being the last of them.

Korrel admits that there is a significant difference. Ambrosius both won and lost battles, while Arthur reportedly never lost a battle. But this is probably the difference between a historical figure and one featured in <a href="Epic%20%28genre%29">epics</a>.

<a href="L%C3%A9on%20Fleuriot">Léon Fleuriot</a> has suggested Ambrosius is identical to <a href="Riothamus">Riothamus</a>, a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470. Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle, in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a>. He then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons.

Frank D. Reno suggests a connection or identification of Ambrosius with <a href="Vortimer">Vortimer</a>. This enigmatic character appears historically only in "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>" of <a href="Nennius">Nennius</a>. He is not mentioned at all by <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>, <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", and the "<a href="Annales%20Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a>". Vortimer does appear in "<a href="Historia%20Regum%20Britanniae">Historia Regum Britanniae</a>" by <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, but in a manner suggesting that Geoffrey used Nennius as a source.

The "Historia Brittonum" features detailed information about Vortimer as a warrior king. Robert Huntingdon Fletcher was the first to note the similarities between Gilas' Ambrosius and Nennius' Vortimer. He suggested that Vortimer practically replaces Ambrosius in Nennius' account. Ambrosius is also featured by Nennius as a powerful leader, but he receives only a few minor notices in the text. Fletcher theorized that Gildas' text represented a Roman faction in Britain, while Nennius drew from an oral and literary legend tradition of a Briton faction.

The difference in names between the two figures may be deceptive. Vortimer might be not a proper name but an <a href="epithet">epithet</a> or a title. Etymologically the name of "Vortigern", Vortimer's father, seems to derive from "vor" (over) and a term for "chieftain" or "king". The meaning would be "overking". Similarly "Vortimer" may derive from the older Celtic "Vortamorix". In this case "vor" means "over", "tamo" is a <a href="superlative">superlative</a> <a href="suffix">suffix</a>, and <a href="R%C3%AD">rix</a> means "king". "Rix" is a cognate to <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "<a href="Rex%20%28title%29">rex</a>" which has the same meaning. The meaning of "Vortimer" would be "over-most king" or "highest king", a synonym for "<a href="high%20king">high king</a>".

Reno agrees with his predecessor scholars that Vortimer is an epithet or title of a king mentioned by other names. He rejects, however, a proposed identification of Vortigern and Vortimer. He points that Vortigern is last mentioned in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" c. 455 as fighting against his former ally <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengist</a>. The outcome is not mentioned but the Saxon campaigns then continue for decades. Reno views Vortigern as a probable early casualty in the war. He suggests that Vortimer was an epithet of the succeeding king, Ambrosius Aurelianus.

It has been suggested that the place-name <a href="Amesbury">Amesbury</a> in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> might preserve the name of Ambrosius, and that perhaps Amesbury was the seat of his power base in the later fifth century. Scholars such as Shimon Applebaum have found a number of <a href="Toponymy">place names</a> through the Midland dialect regions of Britain that incorporate the "ambre-" element; examples include <a href="Ombersley">Ombersley</a> in <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, <a href="Ambrosden">Ambrosden</a> in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, <a href="Amberley%2C%20Herefordshire">Amberley</a> in <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>, <a href="Amberley%2C%20Gloucestershire">Amberley</a> in Gloucestershire, and <a href="Amberley%2C%20West%20Sussex">Amberley</a> in West Sussex. These scholars have claimed that this element represents an <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> word "amor", the name of a woodland bird. However, Amesbury in Wiltshire is in a different dialect region and does not easily fit into the pattern of the Midland dialect place names. It may be tempting to connect Ambrosius with Amesbury if this etymology is combined with the tradition reported by Geoffrey of Monmouth, stating that Ambrosius Aurelianus ordered the building of <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> – which is located within the parish of Amesbury (and where Ambrosius was supposedly buried) – and with the presence of an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a> also in that parish.

The novel "<a href="Coalescent">Coalescent</a>" by <a href="Stephen%20Baxter%20%28author%29">Stephen Baxter</a> depicts Aurelianus as a general to Artorius, Briton and basis for the legend of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>. In Baxter's novel, Aurelianus is a minor character who interacts with the book's main Roman-era protagonist, Regina, founder of an (literally) underground matriarchal society. In the text, he is credited with winning the battle of <a href="Mount%20Badon">Mount Badon</a>.

In <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Mists%20of%20Avalon">The Mists of Avalon</a>", Aurelianus is depicted as the aging High King of Britain, a "too-ambitious" son of a Western Roman Emperor. His sister's son is <a href="Uther%20Pendragon">Uther Pendragon</a>, but Uther is described as not having any Roman blood. Aurelianus is unable to gather the leadership of the native Celts, who refuse to follow any but their own race.

In <a href="Alfred%20Duggan">Alfred Duggan</a>'s "<a href="Conscience%20of%20the%20King%20%28novel%29">Conscience of the King</a>", a <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a> about <a href="Cerdic%20of%20Wessex">Cerdic</a>, founder of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, Ambrosius Aurelianus is a Romano-British general who rose independently to military power, forming alliances with various British kings and setting out to drive the invading Saxons from <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britain</a>. Cerdic, who is of both <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> and British descent and raised as a <a href="Roman%20citizenship">Roman citizen</a>, served in his army as a young man. In the novel Ambrosius is a separate character from Arthur, or Artorius, who appears much later as a foe of Cerdic.

In <a href="Stephen%20R.%20Lawhead">Stephen R. Lawhead</a>'s "<a href="Pendragon%20Cycle">Pendragon Cycle</a>", Aurelianus (most often referred to as "Aurelius") figures prominently, along with his brother Uther, in the second book of the series, "Merlin". He is poisoned soon after becoming <a href="High%20King">High King</a> of Britain, and Uther succeeds him. Lawhead alters the standard Arthurian story somewhat, in that he has Aurelius marry <a href="Igraine">Igraine</a> and become the true father of King Arthur (Uther does marry his brother's widow, though).

In <a href="Valerio%20Massimo%20Manfredi">Valerio Massimo Manfredi</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Legion">The Last Legion</a>", Aurelianus (here called "Aurelianus Ambrosius Ventidius") is a major character and is shown as one of the last loyal Romans, going to enormous lengths for his boy emperor <a href="Romulus%20Augustus">Romulus Augustus</a>, whose power has been wrested by the barbarian <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>. In this story, Romulus Augustus marries <a href="Igraine">Igraine</a>, and <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> is their son, and the sword of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> becomes the legendary <a href="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> in Britain. In the 2007 film version of the novel, he is played by <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a> and his name becomes "Aurelianus Caius Antonius". In both he is called "Aurelius" for short.

<a href="Mary%20Stewart%20%28novelist%29">Mary Stewart</a>'s "<a href="The%20Crystal%20Cave">The Crystal Cave</a>" follows Geoffrey of Monmouth in calling him Aurelius Ambrosius and portrays him as the father of Merlin, the elder brother of Uther (hence uncle of Arthur), an initiate of <a href="Mithras">Mithras</a>, and generally admired by everyone except the Saxons. Much of the book is set at his court in Brittany or during the campaign to retake his throne from Vortigern. Later books in the series show that Merlin's attitude toward Arthur is influenced by his belief that Arthur is a reincarnation of Ambrosius, who is seen through Merlin's eyes as a model of good kingship.

In <a href="Rosemary%20Sutcliff">Rosemary Sutcliff</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lantern%20Bearers%20%28Sutcliff%20novel%29">The Lantern Bearers</a>" Prince Ambrosius Aurelianus of Arfon drives out the Saxons by training his British army with Roman techniques and making effective use of cavalry. By the end of the novel, the elite <a href="cavalry%20wing">cavalry wing</a> is led by a dashing young warrior prince named Artos, whom Sutcliff postulates to be the real Arthur.

In <a href="Parke%20Godwin">Parke Godwin</a>'s "<a href="Firelord%20%28novel%29">Firelord</a>", Ambrosius is the elderly tribune of the diminished, dispirited and politically fractured <a href="Legio%20VI%20Victrix">Legio VI Victrix</a> garrisoning <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>. Near his death, he names Artorius Pendragon (Arthur) as his successor, encourages him to convert the legion to alae (heavy cavalry) and allows the legionnaires to renounce their loyalty to Rome and take personal oaths of fealty to Artorius in order to help unify Brittania politically and to create a military force with the ability to quickly redeploy to meet differing threats.

In <a href="Jack%20Whyte">Jack Whyte</a>'s "<a href="Camulod%20Chronicles">Camulod Chronicles</a>", Ambrosius Aurelianus is the half-brother of Caius Merlyn Britannicus (Merlin) and helps him lead the people of Camulod (<a href="Camelot">Camelot</a>).

In "<a href="Stargate%20SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a>", Ambrosius and Arthur are one and the same. <a href="Moros%20%28Stargate%29">Merlin</a> was an <a href="Ancient%20%28Stargate%29">Ancient</a>, fleeing from <a href="Atlantis%20%28Stargate%29">Atlantis</a> and later Ascends, then comes back in order build the <a href="Sangraal%20%28Stargate%29">Sangraal</a>, or Holy Grail, to defeat the <a href="Ori%20%28Stargate%29">Ori</a>. <a href="Daniel%20Jackson%20%28Stargate%29">Daniel Jackson</a> also comments that it would mean that Ambrosius was 74 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Badon">Battle of Mount Badon</a>.

Ammon

Ammon (; ) was an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic-speaking</a> nation occupying the east of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, between the torrent valleys of <a href="Wadi%20Mujib">Arnon</a> and <a href="Jabbok">Jabbok</a>, in present-day <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>. The chief city of the country was "<a href="Rabbah">Rabbah</a>" or "Rabbath Ammon", site of the modern city of <a href="Amman">Amman</a>, Jordan's capital. <a href="Moloch">Milcom</a> and <a href="Moloch">Molech</a> (who may be one and the same) are named in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> as the gods of Ammon. The people of this kingdom are called "Children of Ammon" or "Ammonites".

The Ammonites occupied the northern Central Trans-Jordanian Plateau from the latter part of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.

Ammon maintained its independence from the <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20Empire">Assyrian</a> empire through tribute to the Assyrian king, at a time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered. <a href="Kurkh%20Monolith">Inscriptions describe</a> the Ammonite king <a href="Baasha%20ben%20Ruhubi">Baasha ben Ruhubi</a>'s army fighting alongside <a href="Ahab">Ahab</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a> and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>n allies against <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Qarqar">Battle of Qarqar</a> in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of <a href="Hadadezer">Hadadezer</a>, the Aramaean king of <a href="Aram%20Damascus">Damascus</a>. In 734 BC the Ammonite king <a href="Sanipu">Sanipu</a> was a vassal of <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20III">Tiglath-Pileser III</a>, and Sanipu's successor <a href="Pudu-ilu">Pudu-ilu</a> held the same position under <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> and <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a>. An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did.

Somewhat later, the Ammonite king <a href="Amminadab%20I%20of%20Ammon">Amminadab I</a> was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>n campaign of <a href="Assurbanipal">Assurbanipal</a>. Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are <a href="Barachel%20%28Ammon%29">Barachel</a> (attested to in several contemporary <a href="seal%20%28device%29">seals</a>) and <a href="Hissalel">Hissalel</a>, the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at <a href="Tel%20Siran">Tel Siran</a>, Jordan along with his son, King <a href="Amminadab%20II%20of%20Ammon">Amminadab II</a>, who reigned around 600 BCE.

Archaeology and history indicate that Ammon flourished during the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a> period. This contradicts the view, dominant for decades, that Transjordan was either destroyed by <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>, or suffered a rapid decline following Judah's destruction by that king. Newer evidence suggests that Ammon enjoyed continuity from the Neo-Babylonian to the Persian period.

Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> and early <a href="Hellenistic%20Age">Hellenistic</a> periods. Their name appears, however, during the time of the <a href="Maccabees">Maccabees</a>. The Ammonites, with some of the neighboring tribes, did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under <a href="Judas%20Maccabaeus">Judas Maccabaeus</a>. The Hasmonean dynast <a href="John%20Hyrcanus">Hyrcanus</a> founded <a href="Qasr%20al%20Abd%23History">Qasr Al Abd</a>, and was a descendant of the Seleucid <a href="Tobiad">Tobiad</a> dynasty of <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Tobit">Tobiah</a>, who is mentioned by Nehemiah as an Ammonite (ii. 19) from the east-Jordanian district.

The last notice of the Ammonites is in <a href="Justin%20Martyr">Justin Martyr</a>'s "Dialogue with Trypho" (§ 119), in the second century, where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people.

The first mention of the Ammonites in the Bible is in . It is stated there that they descended from Ben-Ammi, a son of <a href="Lot%20%28biblical%29">Lot</a> through incest with his younger daughter. Bén'ámmî, literally means ""son of my people"". After the destruction of <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>, the daughters of Lot had sexual relations with their father, resulting in Ammon and his half brother, <a href="Moab">Moab</a>, being conceived and born. This narrative has traditionally been considered literal fact, but is now generally interpreted as recording a gross popular irony by which the Israelites expressed their loathing of the Moabites and Ammonites, although it is doubtful that the Israelites would have directed such irony to Lot himself.

The Ammonites settled to the east of the Jordan, invading the <a href="Rephaim">Rephaim</a> lands east of Jordan, between the <a href="Jabbok">Jabbok</a> and <a href="Wadi%20Mujib">Arnon</a>, dispossessing them and dwelling in their place. Their territory originally comprising all from the Jordan to the wilderness, and from the River Jabbok south to the River Arnon. It was accounted a land of giants; and that giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites called "Zomzommims".

Shortly before the Israelite <a href="the%20Exodus">Exodus</a>, the <a href="Amorite">Amorite</a>s west of Jordan, under King <a href="Sihon">Sihon</a>, invaded and occupied <a href="Transjordan%20%28region%29">a large portion of the territory of Moab and Ammon</a>. The Ammonites were driven from the rich lands near the Jordan and retreated to the mountains and valleys to the east. The invasion of the Amorites created a wedge and separated the two kingdoms of Ammon and Moab.

Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands. The Ammonites soon allied themselves with <a href="Eglon%20%28king%29">Eglon</a> of Moab in attacking Israel.

The Ammonites maintained their claim to part of <a href="Transjordan%20%28Bible%29">Transjordan</a>, after it was occupied by the Israelites who obtained it from <a href="Sihon">Sihon</a>. During the days of <a href="Jephthah">Jephthah</a>, the Ammonites occupied the lands east of the River Jordan and started to invade Israelite lands west of the river. Jephthah became the leader in resisting these incursions.

The constant harassment of the Israelite communities east of the Jordan by the Ammonites was the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under <a href="Saul">Saul</a>. King <a href="Nahash%20of%20Ammon">Nahash of Ammon</a> (990 BC) lay siege to <a href="Jabesh-Gilead">Jabesh-Gilead</a>. Eventually this led to an alliance with Saul and The Israelites, led by Saul relieved the siege and defeated the Ammonite king, eventually resulting in the formation of the Israelite Kingdom.

During the reign of <a href="King%20David">King David</a>, the Ammonites humiliated David's messengers, and hired the Aramean armies to attack Israel. This eventually ended in a war and a year-long siege of <a href="Rabbah">Rabbah</a>, the capital of Ammon. The war ended with all the Ammonite cities being conquered and plundered, and the inhabitants being killed or put to forced labor at David's command.

When the Arameans of Damascus city-state deprived the Kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became allies of <a href="Hadadezer">Ben-hadad</a>, and a contingent of 1,000 of them served as allies of Syria in the great <a href="Battle%20of%20Qarqar">battle</a> of the Arameans and Assyrians at <a href="Qarqar">Qarqar</a> in 854 BC in the reign of <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a>.

The Ammonites, Moabites and <a href="Meunim">Meunim</a> formed a coalition against <a href="Jehoshaphat">Jehoshaphat</a> of Judah. The coalition later was thrown to confusion, with the armies slaughtering one another. They were subdued and paid tribute to Jotham.

After submitting to Tiglath-pileser they were generally tributary to Assyria, but have joined in the general uprising that took place under <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>; but they submitted and they became tributary in the reign of <a href="Esar-haddon">Esar-haddon</a>. Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings24_sml.htm%232kings_24%3A2">2 Kings 24:2</a>). Their cruelty is denounced by the prophet Amos
(<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_amos01_sml.htm%23amos_1%3A13">Amos 1:13</a>), and their destruction (with their return in the future) by Jeremiah (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm%23jeremiah_49%3A1">Jeremiah 49:1</a>–<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm%23jeremiah_49%3A6">6</a>); Ezekiel (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm%23ezekiel_21%3A28">Ezekiel 21:28</a>–<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm%23ezekiel_21%3A32">32</a>); and Zechariah (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm%23zechariah_2%3A8">Zechariah 2:8</a>, <a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm%23zechariah_2%3A9">9</a>). Their murder of Gedaliah (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm%232kings_25%3A22">2 Kings 25:22</a>–<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm%232kings_25%3A26">26</a>; <a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah40_sml.htm%23jeremiah_40%3A14">Jeremiah 40:14</a>) was a dastardly act. They may have regained their old territory when Tiglath-pileser carried off the Israelites East of the Jordan into captivity (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings15_sml.htm%232kings_15%3A29">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles05_sml.htm%231chronicles_5%3A26">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>).

Tobiah the Ammonite united with Sanballat to oppose Nehemiah (<a href="http%3A//www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah04_sml.htm">Nehemiah 4</a>), and their opposition to the Jews did not cease with the establishment of the latter in Judea.

They also joined the Syrians in their wars with the Maccabees and were defeated by Judas.

According to both and , <a href="Naamah%20%28wife%20of%20Solomon%29">Naamah</a> was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> to be mentioned by name in the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon's successor, <a href="Rehoboam">Rehoboam</a>.

The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the <a href="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> because many marriages between Israelite men and Ammonite (and Moabite) women had taken place in the days of <a href="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a>. The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish. The legitimacy of <a href="David">David</a>'s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.

The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and <a href="Hanun">Hanun</a>, both from the Bible. The Ammonites' language is believed to be in the <a href="Canaanite%20languages">Canaanite family</a>, closely related to <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Moabite%20language">Moabite</a>. Ammonite may have incorporated certain <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> influences, including the use of "‘bd", instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew "‘śh", for "work". The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular "-t" (e.g., "’šħt" "cistern", but "‘lyh" "high (fem.)".)

The economy, for the most part, was based on agriculture and herding. Most people lived in small villages surrounded by farms and pastures. Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the <a href="King%27s%20Highway%20%28ancient%29">King's Highway</a>, the ancient trade route connecting <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> with <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue. Circa 950 BCE Ammon showed rising prosperity, due to <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="trade">trade</a>, and built a series of fortresses. Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of <a href="Amman">Amman</a>.

In 1972, during the excavations of a site called Tell Siran in north-west Amman, an inscription on a bronze bottle of about 10 cm tall was found. Scientific investigation has showed that the inscription dates back to 600 BC, and later concluded that it was a lyric poem written in <a href="Ammonite%20language">Ammonite language</a>. The poem talks about a drinking song, roughly translated to:

Ammonius Hermiae

Ammonius Hermiae (; ; AD) was a <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Greek</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>, and the son of the <a href="Neoplatonist">Neoplatonist</a> philosophers <a href="Hermias%20%28philosopher%29">Hermias</a> and <a href="Aedesia">Aedesia</a>. He was a pupil of <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, and taught at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> for most of his life, writing commentaries on <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and other philosophers.

Ammonius' father, <a href="Hermias%20%28philosopher%29">Hermias</a>, died when he was a child, and his mother, Aedesia, raised him and his brother, <a href="Heliodorus%20of%20Alexandria">Heliodorus</a>, in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. When they reached adulthood, Aedesia accompanied her sons to <a href="Athens">Athens</a> where they studied under <a href="Proclus">Proclus</a>. Eventually, they returned to Alexandria, where Ammonius, as head of the Neoplatonist school in Alexandria, lectured on <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> for the rest of his life. According to <a href="Damascius">Damascius</a>, during the persecution of the <a href="paganism">pagans</a> at Alexandria in the late 480's, Ammonius made concessions to the <a href="Christian">Christian</a> authorities so that he could continue his lectures. Damascius, who scolds Ammonius for the agreement that he made, does not say what the concessions were, but it may have involved limitations on the doctrines he could teach or promote. He was still teaching in 515; <a href="Olympiodorus%20the%20Younger">Olympiodorus</a> heard him lecture on <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s "Gorgias" in that year. He also taught <a href="Asclepius%20of%20Tralles">Asclepius of Tralles</a>, <a href="John%20Philoponus">John Philoponus</a>, <a href="Damascius">Damascius</a> and <a href="Simplicius%20of%20Cilicia">Simplicius</a>.
He was also an accomplished <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>; he lectured on <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> and is known to have written a treatise on the <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a>.

Of his reputedly numerous writings, only his commentary on Aristotle's "De Interpretatione" survives intact. A commentary on <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>'s "<a href="Isagoge">Isagoge</a>" may also be his, but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations.

In "De Interpretatione," Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent. Like
<a href="Boethius">Boëthius</a> in his second "Commentary" and "<a href="The%20Consolation%20of%20Philosophy">The Consolation of Philosophy</a>," this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer. Ammonius cites <a href="Iamblichus">Iamblichus</a> who said "knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known, since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known."

In addition, there are some notes of Ammonius' lectures written by various students which also survive:


There is Greek-language work called "Life of Aristotle", which is usually ascribed to Ammonius, but "is more probable that it is the work of <a href="Joannes%20Philoponus">Joannes Philoponus</a>, the pupil of Ammonius, to whom it is ascribed in some <a href="Manuscript">MSS</a>."

Ammonius Saccas

Ammonius Saccas (; ; fl. 3rd century AD) was a Greek <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> who was often referred to as one of the founders of <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>. He is mainly known as the teacher of <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a>, whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243. He was undoubtedly the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>, although little is known about his own philosophical views. Later <a href="Christian">Christian</a> writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian, but it is now generally assumed that there was a different <a href="Ammonius%20of%20Alexandria%20%28Christian%29">Ammonius of Alexandria</a> who wrote biblical texts.

Not much is known about the life of Ammonius Saccas. 

His cognomen "Sakkas" has been interpreted to indicate that he was a porter in his youth. This seems to be a misreading of "Sakkas" for "sakkophoros" (porter) which is grammatically incorrect. However Erich Seeberg argued that the cognomen refers to the "<a href="Shakya">Śākyas</a>" of India, the ruling clan to which Gautama Buddha also belonged. The "Śākyas" (related to <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a> <a href="Saka">Saka</a>, <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> and <a href="Indo-Scythians">Indo-Scythians</a>) were known in antiquity. The cognomen "Sakkas" therefore referred to India as a marker of ethnic identity. This is, according to this interpretation, supported by the fact that Ammianus Marcellinus refers to him as "Saccas Ammonius", thus as the "Sacian Ammonius", which makes any reading as denoting "sakkos" impossible. This interpretation of the name, which has subsequently been contested, would corroborate Porphyry's report that Plotinus, Ammonius' foremost student, acquired his high esteem for Indian philosophy and his eager desire to travel to India from Ammonius. 

The interpretation that "Saccas" denotes ethnic northern Indian origin, rather than alluding to Gautama Buddha, supports the possibility that Ammonius may have been raised a Christian, who reverted to paganism, as reported by Eusebius, drawing on Porphyry's Contra Christianos. In this case Ammonius may have been a second-generation Indian who remained in contact with the philosophy of his ancestral country. The intensity of commerce of goods and ideas between Alexandria and India makes this a wholly possible option. 

The link to India however is not only consistent with Plotinus' passion for India, but also helps to explain the often noted substantial agreements and shared ideas between Vedanta and Neoplatonism which are increasingly attributed to direct Indian influence.

Most details of his life come from the fragments left from <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>'s writings. The most famous pupil of Ammonius Saccas was <a href="Plotinus">Plotinus</a> who studied under Ammonius for eleven years. According to Porphyry, in 232, at the age of 28, Plotinus went to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to study philosophy:
In his twenty-eighth year he [Plotinus] felt the impulse to study philosophy and was recommended to the teachers in Alexandria who then had the highest reputation; but he came away from their lectures so depressed and full of sadness that he told his trouble to one of his friends. The friend, understanding the desire of his heart, sent him to Ammonius, whom he had not so far tried. He went and heard him, and said to his friend, "This is the man I was looking for." From that day he stayed continually with Ammonius and acquired so complete a training in philosophy that he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians.

According to Porphyry, the parents of Ammonius were <a href="Christians">Christians</a>, but upon learning Greek philosophy, Ammonius rejected his parents' religion for <a href="paganism">paganism</a>. This conversion is contested by the Christian writers <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, who state that Ammonius remained a Christian throughout his lifetime:

[Porphyry] plainly utters a falsehood (for what will not an opposer of Christians do?) when he says that ... Ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs. ... Ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life. His works yet extant show this, as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left.

However, we are told by <a href="Cassius%20Longinus%20%28philosopher%29">Longinus</a> that Ammonius wrote nothing, and if Ammonius was the principal influence on Plotinus, then it is unlikely that Ammonius would have been a Christian. One way to explain much of the confusion concerning Ammonius is to assume that there were two people called Ammonius: Ammonius Saccas who taught Plotinus, and an <a href="Ammonius%20of%20Alexandria%20%28Christian%29">Ammonius the Christian</a> who wrote biblical texts. Another explanation might be that there was only one Ammonius but that Origen, who found the Neo-Platonist views of his teacher essential to his own beliefs about the essential nature of Christianity, chose to suppress Ammonius' choice of Paganism over Christianity. The insistence of Eusebius, Origen's pupil, and Jerome, all of whom were recognized Fathers of the Christian Church, that Ammonius Saccas had not rejected his Christian roots would be easier for Christians to accept than the assertion of Prophyry, who was a Pagan, that Ammonius had chosen Paganism over Christianity.

To add to the confusion, it seems that Ammonius had two pupils called Origen: <a href="Origen">Origen the Christian</a>, and <a href="Origen%20the%20Pagan">Origen the Pagan</a>. It is quite possible that Ammonius Saccas taught both Origens. And since there were two Origens who were accepted as contemporaries it was easy for later Christians to accept that there were two individuals named Ammonius, one a Christian and one a Pagan. Among Ammonius' other pupils there were <a href="Herennius%20%28Neoplatonist%29">Herennius</a> and <a href="Cassius%20Longinus%20%28philosopher%29">Cassius Longinus</a>.

<a href="Hierocles%20of%20Alexandria">Hierocles</a>, writing in the 5th century, states that Ammonius' fundamental doctrine was that <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> were in full agreement with each other:
He was the first who had a godly zeal for the truth in philosophy and despised the views of the majority, which were a disgrace to philosophy. He apprehended well the views of each of the two philosophers [Plato and Aristotle] and brought them under one and the same "<a href="nous">nous</a>" and transmitted philosophy without conflicts to all of his disciples, and especially to the best of those acquainted with him, Plotinus, Origen, and their successors.

According to <a href="Nemesius">Nemesius</a>, a <a href="bishop">bishop</a> and <a href="Neoplatonist">Neoplatonist</a> c. 400, Ammonius held that the <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a> was immaterial.

Little is known about Ammonius's role in the development of <a href="Neoplatonism">Neoplatonism</a>. Porphyry seems to suggest that Ammonius was instrumental in helping Plotinus think about philosophy in new ways:
But he [Plotinus] did not just speak straight out of these books but took a distinctive personal line in his consideration, and brought the mind of Ammonius' to bear on the investigation in hand.
Two of Ammonius's students - <a href="Origen%20the%20Pagan">Origen the Pagan</a>, and <a href="Cassius%20Longinus%20%28philosopher%29">Longinus</a> - seem to have held philosophical positions which were closer to <a href="Middle%20Platonism">Middle Platonism</a> than Neoplatonism, which perhaps suggests that Ammonius's doctrines were also closer to those of Middle Platonism than the Neoplatonism developed by Plotinus (see the <a href="Enneads">Enneads</a>), but Plotinus does not seem to have thought that he was departing in any significant way from that of his master.

pageRank.Book of Amos

The pageRank.Book of Amos is the third of the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a> in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>/<a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> and the second in the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> tradition. <a href="Amos%20%28prophet%29">Amos</a>, an older contemporary of <a href="Hosea">Hosea</a> and <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, was active c. 750 BCE during the reign of <a href="Jeroboam%20II">Jeroboam II</a> (788–747 BCE), making the pageRank.Book of Amos the first biblical prophetic book written. Amos lived in the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">kingdom of Judah</a> but preached in the northern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">kingdom of Israel</a>. His major themes of <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>, God's <a href="omnipotence">omnipotence</a>, and <a href="divine%20judgment">divine judgment</a> became staples of prophecy.


The book opens with a historical note about the prophet, then a short oracle announcing <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>'s (i.e., God)'s judgement (repeated in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Joel">pageRank.Book of Joel</a>. The prophet denounces the crimes against humanity committed by the gentile nations, tells Israel that even they have sinned and are guilty of the same crimes, and report five symbolic visions prophesying the destruction of Israel. Included in this, with no apparent order, are an oracle on the nature of prophecy, snippets of hymns, oracles of woe, a third-person prose narrative concerning the prophet, and an oracle promising restoration of the House of David, which had not yet fallen in Amos's lifetime.

<a href="Amos%20%28prophet%29">Amos</a> prophesied during the reign of <a href="Jeroboam%20II">Jeroboam II</a>, King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a>, and of <a href="Uzziah">Uzziah</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, which places him in the first half of the 8th century BCE. According to the book's superscription (Amos 1:1) he was from Tekoa, a town in Judah south of Jerusalem, but his prophetic mission was in the northern kingdom. He is called a "shepherd" and a "dresser of sycamore trees", but the book's literary qualities suggest a man of education rather than a poor farmer.

Scholars have long recognized that Amos utilized an ancient hymn within his prophecy, verses of which are found at 4.13; 5.8–9; 8.8; 9.5–6. This hymn is best understood as praising YHWH for His judgment, demonstrated in His destructive power, rather than praise for creation. Scholarship has also identified <a href="Lament%20for%20Ur">'Sumerian City Lament' (SCL)</a> motifs within Amos and particularly the hymn, offering the possibility that Amos used SCL as a literary template for his prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction. The Amos hymn has also been discussed in terms of a 'covenant curse' which was used to warn Israel of the consequences of breaking the covenant, and in particular a 'Flood covenant-curse' motif, first identified by D.R. Hillers. Recent scholarship has shown Amos' hymn is an ancient narrative text, has identified a new verse at 7.4; and has compared the hymn to the Genesis Flood account and Job 9:5–10.

The central idea of the book of Amos is that God puts his people on the same level as the surrounding nations – God expects the same purity of them all. As it is with all nations that rise up against the kingdom of God, even Israel and Judah will not be exempt from the judgment of God because of their idolatry and unjust ways. The nation that represents YHWH must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of God. God's name must be exalted.

Amos is the first prophet to use the term "the <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Lord">Day of the Lord</a>. This phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature. For the people of Israel "the day of the " is the day when God will fight against his and their enemies, and it will be a day of victory for Israel. However, Amos and other prophets include Israel as an enemy of God, as Israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent, poor, and young women. To Amos "the day of the Lord" will be a day of doom.

Other major ideas in the book of Amos include: <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and concern for the disadvantaged; the idea that Israel's <a href="covenant%20%28biblical%29">covenant</a> with God did not exempt them from accountability for sin; God is God of all nations; God is judge of all nations; God is God of moral righteousness; God made all people; God elected Israel and then liberated Israel so that He would be known throughout the world; election by God means that those elected are responsible to live according to the purposes clearly outlined to them in the covenant; if God destroys the unjust, a remnant will remain; and God is free to judge whether to redeem Israel.

Amphipolis

Amphipolis ( - "Amfipoli"; , "Amphípolis") 
is best known for the magnificent ancient Greek <a href="Polis">city (polis)</a>, and later Roman city, whose impressive remains can still be seen.

It is famous in history for events such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amphipolis">battle</a> between the Spartans and Athenians in 422 BC, and also as the place where <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> prepared for campaigns leading to his invasion of Asia. Alexander's three finest admirals, <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, Androsthenes and Laomedon, resided in this city and it is also the place where, after Alexander's death, his wife <a href="Roxana">Roxane</a> and their small son <a href="Alexander%20IV%20of%20Macedon">Alexander IV</a> were exiled and later murdered.

Excavations in and around the city have revealed important buildings, ancient walls and tombs. At the nearby vast <a href="Kasta%20Tomb">Kasta burial mound</a>, an important ancient Macedonian tomb has recently been revealed. The unique and beautiful "Lion of Amphipolis" monument nearby is a popular destination for visitors.

It is today a municipality in the <a href="Serres%20%28regional%20unit%29">Serres regional unit</a> of <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. The seat of the municipality is <a href="Rodolivos">Rodolivos</a>.

Throughout the 5th century BC, <a href="Delian%20League">Athens</a> sought to consolidate its control over Thrace, which was strategically important because of its primary materials (the gold and silver of the <a href="Pangaion%20hills">Pangaion hills</a> and the dense forests essential for naval construction), and the sea routes vital for Athens' supply of grain from <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>. After a first unsuccessful attempt at colonisation in 497 BC by the <a href="Miletus">Milesian</a> <a href="Tyrant">Tyrant</a> <a href="Histiaeus">Histiaeus</a>, the Athenians founded a first colony at Ennea-Hodoi (‘Nine Ways’) in 465, but these first ten thousand colonists were massacred by the <a href="Thracians">Thracians</a>. A second attempt took place in 437 BC on the same site under the guidance of <a href="Hagnon%2C%20son%20of%20Nikias">Hagnon</a>, son of <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a>, which was successful. The city and its first walls date from this time.
The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis (literally, "around the city"), a name which is the subject of much debate about its <a href="etymology">etymology</a>. Thucydides claims the name comes from the fact that the Strymon flows "around the city" on two sides; however a note in the <a href="Suda">Suda</a> (also given in the lexicon of <a href="Patriarch%20Photios%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Photius</a>) offers a different explanation apparently given by <a href="Marsyas">Marsyas</a>, son of <a href="Periander">Periander</a>: that a large proportion of the population lived "around the city". However, a more probable explanation is the one given by <a href="Julius%20Pollux">Julius Pollux</a>: that the name indicates the vicinity of an <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a>.

Amphipolis became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and, consequently, a target of choice for their <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n adversaries. The Athenian population remained very much in the minority in the city. For this reason Amphipolis remained an independent city and an ally of the Athenians, rather than a colony or member of the confederacy. However, in 424 BC the Spartan general <a href="Brasidas">Brasidas</a> easily took control of the city.

A rescue expedition led by the Athenian general, and later historian, Thucydides had to settle for securing <a href="Eion">Eion</a> and could not retake Amphipolis, a failure for which Thucydides was sentenced to exile. A new Athenian force under the command of <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a> failed once more in 422 BC during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amphipolis">Battle of Amphipolis</a> at which both Cleon and Brasidas lost their lives. Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp. From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city
and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices.

The city itself kept its independence until the reign of king <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a> (r. 359–336 BC) despite several Athenian attacks, notably because of the government of <a href="Callistratus%20of%20Aphidnae">Callistratus of Aphidnae</a>. In 357 BC, Philip succeeded where the Athenians had failed and conquered the city, thereby removing the obstacle which Amphipolis presented to Macedonian control over Thrace. According to the historian <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>, this conquest came to be the object of a secret accord between Athens and Philip II, who would return the city in exchange for the fortified town of <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, but the Macedonian king betrayed the accord, refusing to cede Amphipolis and laying siege to Pydna as well.

The city was not immediately incorporated into the Macedonian kingdom, and for some time preserved its institutions and a certain degree of autonomy. The border of Macedonia was not moved further east; however, Philip sent a number of Macedonian governors to Amphipolis, and in many respects the city was effectively "Macedonianized". Nomenclature, the calendar and the currency (the <a href="Stater">gold stater</a>, created by Philip to capitalise on the gold reserves of the Pangaion hills, replaced the Amphipolitan <a href="drachma">drachma</a>) were all replaced by Macedonian equivalents. In the reign of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, Amphipolis was an important naval base, and the birthplace of three of the most famous Macedonian admirals: <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>, Androsthenes and <a href="Laomedon%20of%20Mytilene">Laomedon</a>, whose burial place is most likely marked by the famous lion of Amphipolis.
The importance of the city in this period is shown by Alexander the Great's decision that it was one of the six cities at which large luxurious temples costing 1500 talents were built. Alexander prepared for campaigns here against Thrace in 335BC and the his army and fleet assembled near the port before the invasion of Asia. The port was also used as naval base during his campaigns in Asia. After Alexander's death, his wife Roxane and their small son Alexander IV were exiled by <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> and later murdered here.

Throughout Macedonian sovereignty Amphipolis was a strong fortress of great strategic and economic importance, as shown by inscriptions. Amphipolis became one of the main stops on the Macedonian royal road (as testified by a border stone found between <a href="Philippi">Philippi</a> and Amphipolis giving the distance to the latter), and later on the "<a href="Via%20Egnatia">Via Egnatia</a>", the principal <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman road</a> which crossed the southern Balkans. Apart from the ramparts of the lower town, the <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> and a set of well-preserved frescoes from a wealthy villa are the only artifacts from this period that remain visible. Though little is known of the layout of the town, modern knowledge of its institutions is in considerably better shape thanks to a rich epigraphic documentation, including a military ordinance of <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V</a> and an <a href="Ephebos">ephebarchic</a> law from the gymnasium.

After the final victory of <a href="Roman%20Empire">Rome</a> over Macedonia in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">battle</a> in 168 BC, Amphipolis became the capital one of the four mini-republics, or "merides", which were created by the Romans out of the kingdom of the <a href="Antigonid%20Dynasty">Antigonids</a> which <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great%23Legacy%20and%20division%20of%20the%20empire">succeeded</a> Alexander’s empire in Macedon. These "merides" were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state, and later province, of <a href="Thracia">Thracia</a>. According to the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, the apostles <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a> and <a href="Silas">Silas</a> passed through Amphipolis in the early 50s AD, on their <a href="Missionary%20journeys%20of%20Paul">journey</a> between <a href="Philippi">Philippi</a> and <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>; where hence they proselytized to the Greeks, including <a href="Epicurean">Epicurean</a> and <a href="Stoic">Stoic</a> philosophers.

During the period of <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>, Amphipolis benefited from the increasing economic prosperity of Macedonia, as is evidenced by the large number of <a href="Christianity">Christian churches</a> that were built. Significantly however, these churches were built within a restricted area of the town, sheltered by the walls of the <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>. This has been taken as evidence that the large fortified perimeter of the ancient town was no longer defendable, and that the population of the city had considerably diminished.

Nevertheless, the number, size and quality of the churches constructed between the fifth and sixth centuries are impressive. Four <a href="basilica">basilica</a>s adorned with rich <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> floors and elaborate architectural sculptures (such as the ram-headed <a href="column">column</a> capitals - see picture) have been excavated, as well as a church with a hexagonal central plan which evokes that of the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Vitale">basilica</a> of <a href="Saint%20Vitalis%20of%20Milan">St. Vitalis</a> in <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>. It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town. One possible explanation provided by the historian <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Boulanger">André Boulanger</a> is that an increasing ‘willingness’ on the part of the wealthy upper classes in the late Roman period to spend money on local <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a> projects (which he terms "<a href="euergetism">euergetism</a>", from the Greek verb εύεργετέω, (meaning 'I do good') was exploited by the local church to its advantage, which led to a mass gentrification of the urban centre and of the agricultural riches of the city’s territory. Amphipolis was also a <a href="diocese">diocese</a> under the <a href="metropolitan%20see">metropolitan see</a> of <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> - the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533. The bishopric is today listed by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> as a <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a>.

The <a href="South%20Slavs%23Interaction%20with%20the%20Balkan%20population">Slavic invasions</a> of the late 6th century gradually encroached on the back-country Amphipolitan lifestyle and led to the decline of the town, during which period its inhabitants retreated to the area around the acropolis. The ramparts were maintained to a certain extent, thanks to materials plundered from the monuments of the lower city, and the large unused cisterns of the upper city were occupied by small houses and the workshops of artisans. Around the middle of the 7th century AD, a further reduction of the inhabited area of the city was followed by an increase in the fortification of the town, with the construction of a new rampart with pentagonal towers cutting through the middle of the remaining monuments. The acropolis, the <a href="Thermae">Roman baths</a>, and especially the episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall.

The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century, as the last bishop was attested in 787. Its inhabitants probably moved to the neighbouring site of ancient Eion, port of Amphipolis, which had been rebuilt and refortified in the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine period</a> under the name “Chrysopolis”. This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity, before being abandoned during the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman period</a>. The last recorded sign of activity in the region of Amphipolis was the construction of a fortified tower to the north in 1367 by the "<a href="megas%20primikerios">megas primikerios</a>" John and the "<a href="stratopedarches">stratopedarches</a>" Alexios to protect the land that they had given to the <a href="Pantokratoros%20monastery">monastery of Pantokrator</a> on <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a>.

The site was discovered and described by many travellers and archaeologists during the 19th century, including E. Cousinéry (1831) (engraver), <a href="Leon%20Heuzey">Leon Heuzey</a> (1861), and P. Perdrizet (1894–1899). However, excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War. The <a href="Archaeological%20Society%20of%20Athens">Greek Archaeological Society</a> under D. Lazaridis excavated in 1972 and 1985, uncovering a necropolis, the city wall (see photograph), the basilicas, and the acropolis. Further excavations have since uncovered the river bridge, the gymnasium, Greek and Roman villas and numerous tombs etc.

Parts of the lion monument and tombs were discovered during World War I by Bulgarian and British troops whilst digging trenches in the area. In 1934, M. Feyel, of the <a href="%C3%89cole%20fran%C3%A7aise%20d%27Ath%C3%A8nes">École française d'Athènes</a> (EfA), led an <a href="epigraphy">epigraphical mission</a> to the site and uncovered further remains of the lion monument (a reconstruction was given in the "Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique", a publication of the EfA which is available on line).

The silver ossuary containing the cremated remains of <a href="Brasidas">Brasidas</a> and a gold crown (see image) was found in a tomb in pride of place under the Agora.
In 2012 Greek archaeologists unearthed a large tomb within the <a href="Kasta%20Tomb">Kasta Hill</a>, the biggest burial mound in Greece, northeast of Amphipolis. The large size of the tumulus indicates the prominence of the burials made there. The perimeter wall of the tumulus is 497 meters long, and is made of limestone covered with marble.

The tomb comprises three chambers separated by walls. There are two <a href="sphinxes">sphinxes</a> just outside the entrance to the tomb. Two of the columns supporting the roof in the first section are in the form of <a href="Caryatid">Caryatid</a>s, in the 4th century BC style. The excavation revealed a pebble mosaic showing the abduction of <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a> by <a href="Hades">Hades</a> directly behind the Caryatids and in front of the Macedonian marble door leading to the "third" chamber. Hades' chariot is drawn by two white horses and led to the underworld by <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>. The mosaic verifies the Macedonian character of the tomb. As the head of one of the sphinxes was found inside the tomb behind the broken door, it is clear that there were intruders, probably in antiquity.

The identity of the burial remains unknown and the excavation is continuing. Dr. <a href="Katerina%20Peristeri">Katerina Peristeri</a>, the archaeologist heading the excavation of the tomb, dates the tomb to the 4th Century BC, the period after the death of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> (323 BC).


The municipality Amfipoli was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:

The municipality has an area of 411.773 km, the municipal unit 152.088 km.

The fictional character <a href="Xena">Xena</a>, of the TV series "", was depicted as being from the city of Amphipolis.

Amram

In the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Exodus">pageRank.Book of Exodus</a>, Amram ( ; ) is the husband of <a href="Jochebed">Jochebed</a> and father of <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a>, <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="Miriam">Miriam</a>.

In addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin, but the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> states that she was his father's sister. He is praised for his faith in the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>.

Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Generations">pageRank.Book of Generations</a>, a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar <a href="wiktionary%3Areligiopolitical">religiopolitical</a> group and date to the <a href="priestly%20source">priestly source</a>. According to <a href="Biblical%20criticism">critical scholars</a>, the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an <a href="aetiology">aetiological</a> <a href="myth">myth</a> reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the <a href="Levites">Levites</a> – the <a href="Gershonites">Gershonites</a>, <a href="Kohathites">Kohathites</a>, <a href="Merarites">Merarites</a>, and <a href="Kohen">Aaronid</a>s; Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – could not be portrayed as a brother to <a href="Gershon">Gershon</a>, <a href="Kohath">Kohath</a>, and <a href="Merari">Merari</a>, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier <a href="Elohist">Elohist</a> source, mentions only that "both" his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). Critical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both <a href="matrilinear%20descent">matrilineal</a> and <a href="patrilinear%20descent">patrilineal</a> descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.

Amram is Arabicized to Imran (). Commentators of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a> have linked two individuals to the name Imran. They are unanimous in asserting that Imran in verse is clearly the father of <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>, whose genealogy, according to <a href="al-Tabari">al-Tabari</a>, traces back to <a href="King%20David">David</a>. But they disagreed whether the Imran mentioned in verse was the father of Moses and Aaron, or Mary. 

In a hadith found in <a href="Sahih%20Muslim">Sahih Muslim</a>, the name of Moses is given as "Musa bin Imran".

According to the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, Amram's family tree would be as follows:

According to the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>, Amram's family tree would be:

According to <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Jasher%20%28biblical%20references%29">The pageRank.Book of Jasher</a>, Amram's family tree would be:

In the <a href="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>l "<a href="Testament%20of%20Levi">Testament of Levi</a>", it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of <a href="Levi">Levi</a>, when Levi was 64 years old. The <a href="Exodus%20Rabbah">Exodus Rabbah</a> argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed; however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. According to the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.

Despite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay. The other three ancient Israelites who died without sin, being <a href="Benjamin">Benjamin</a>, <a href="Jesse">Jesse</a> and <a href="Chileab">Chileab</a>.

According to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Jubilees">pageRank.Book of Jubilees</a>, Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of <a href="Joseph%20%28Genesis%29%29">Joseph</a>) to Canaan for burial in the <a href="cave%20of%20Machpelah">cave of Machpelah</a>. Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan, including Amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later.

One of the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the "<a href="Visions%20of%20Amram">Visions of Amram</a>".

Amyntas I of Macedon

Amyntas I (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: Ἀμύντας Aʹ; 498 BC) was a king of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a>. He was a son of <a href="Alcetas%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alcetas I of Macedon</a>. He married Eurydice and they had a son <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander</a>.

Amyntas was a <a href="vassal">vassal</a> of <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a>, king of the Persian <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>, since 512/511 BC.
The history of Macedonia may be said to begin with Amyntas' reign. He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states. 
In particular, he entered into an alliance with <a href="Hippias%20%28tyrant%29">Hippias</a> of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of <a href="Anthemous">Anthemus</a> on the <a href="Thermaic%20Gulf">Thermaic Gulf</a> with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the Greeks. 
Hippias refused the offer and also rejected the offer of <a href="Iolcos">Iolcos</a>, as Amyntas probably did not control Anthemous at that time, but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.

Amyntas III of Macedon

Amyntas III (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>: Ἀμύντας Γ΄; died 370 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> in 393 BC, and again from 392 to 370 BC. He was the son of Arrhidaeus and grandson of Amyntas, one of the sons of <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Macedon">Alexander I</a>. His most famous son is <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a>, father of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. He is historically considered the founder of the unified Macedonian state.

He came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">Archelaus I</a>. But he had many enemies at home; in 393 he was driven out by the <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>ns, but in the following year, with the aid of the <a href="Thessalia">Thessalia</a>ns, he recovered his kingdom. Medius, head of the house of the <a href="Aleuadae">Aleuadae</a> of <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>, is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne. The mutual relationship between the <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argeadae</a> and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus.

To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians, Amyntas established an alliance with the <a href="Chalkidian%20League">Chalkidian League</a> led by <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a>. In exchange for this support, Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber, which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet. With <a href="money">money</a> flowing into Olynthus from these exports, their power grew. In response, Amyntas sought additional allies. He established connections with <a href="Cotys%20I%20%28Odrysian%29">Kotys</a>, chief of the <a href="Odrysians">Odrysians</a>. Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general <a href="Iphicrates">Iphicrates</a>. Prevented from marrying into Kotys' family, Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son.

After the King's Peace 387 BC, <a href="History%20of%20Sparta">Sparta</a> was anxious to re-establish its presence in northern Greece. In 385 BC, <a href="Bardylis">Bardylis</a> and his <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> attacked <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> instigated and aided by <a href="Dionysius%20I%20of%20Syracuse">Dionysius I of Syracuse</a>, in an attempt to restore the <a href="Molossian">Molossian</a> king <a href="Alcetas%20I%20of%20Epirus">Alcetas I of Epirus</a> to the throne. When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus, the Spartans eagerly responded. That Olynthus was backed by Athens and Thebes, rivals to Sparta for the control of Greece, provided them with an additional incentive to break up this growing power in the north. Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans, who assisted him to reduce <a href="Olynthus">Olynthus</a> (379). He also entered into a league with <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a>, and assiduously cultivated the friendship of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. In 371 BC at a Panhellenic congress of the <a href="Lacedaemonian">Lacedaemonian</a> allies, he voted in support of the <a href="Athenians">Athenians</a>' claim and joined other Greeks in voting to help Athens to recover possession of <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a>.

With Olynthus defeated, Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself. Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian <a href="Timotheus%20%28general%29">Timotheus</a>, in <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>.

Amyntas married <a href="Eurydice%20I%20of%20Macedon">Eurydice</a>, daughter of <a href="Sirras">Sirras of Lynkestis</a>, circa 390. By her, Amyntas had three sons, all of whom became kings of Macedonia one after the other, and a daughter:

Justin also mentions that Amyntas had three sons by another wife, Gygaea (probably an Argead): Archelaus, Arrhidaeus and Menelaus. The fact that they did not try to take the throne before the 350s suggests that they were younger than Amyntas' children by Eurydice. They were ultimately eliminated by their half-brother Philip II because they had a claim to the throne.

Amyntas died at an advanced age, leaving his throne to his eldest son, Alexander II.

<doc id="1732" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1732" title="Anacharsis">
Anacharsis

Anacharsis (; , ) was a <a href="Scythians">Scythian</a> philosopher who travelled from his homeland on the northern shores of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to <a href="Athens">Athens</a> in the early 6th century BC and made a great impression as a forthright, outspoken "<a href="barbarian">barbarian</a>". Reputedly a forerunner of the <a href="Cynicism%20%28philosophy%29">Cynics</a>, none of his works has survived.

Anacharsis the son of Gnurus, a Scythian chief, was half Greek and from a mixed Hellenic culture, apparently in the region of the <a href="Cimmerian%20Bosporus">Cimmerian Bosporus</a>. He left his native country to travel in pursuit of knowledge, and came to Athens about 589 BC, at a time when <a href="Solon">Solon</a> was occupied with <a href="Solonian%20Constitution">his legislative measures</a>.

According to the story recounted by <a href="Hermippus%20of%20Smyrna">Hermippus</a>, Anacharsis arrived at the house of Solon and said, "I have traveled here from afar to make you my friend." Solon replied, "It's better to make friends at home." Thereupon the Scythian replied, "Then it is necessary for you, being at home, to make friends with me." Solon laughed and accepted him as his friend.

Anacharsis cultivated the outsider's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things. For example, Plutarch remarks that he "expressed his wonder at the fact that in Greece wise men spoke and fools decided." His conversation was droll and frank, and Solon and the Athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher. His rough and free discourse became proverbial among Athenians as 'Scythian discourse'.

Anacharsis was the first foreigner (<a href="metic">metic</a>) who received the privileges of Athenian citizenship. He was reckoned by some ancient authors as one of the <a href="Seven%20Sages%20of%20Greece">Seven Sages of Greece</a>, and it is said that he was initiated into the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a> of the Great Goddess, a privilege denied to those who did not speak fluent <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>.

According to <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, when Anacharsis returned to the Scythians he was killed by his own brother for his Greek ways and especially for the impious attempt to sacrifice to the Mother Goddess <a href="Cybele">Cybele</a>, whose cult was unwelcome among the Scythians.

None of the works ascribed to him in <a href="Ancient%20history">ancient times</a>, if indeed they were written by him, have survived. He was said to have written a book comparing the laws of the Scythians with the laws of the Greeks, as well as work on the art of war. All that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him. He became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the Greeks. He exhorted moderation in everything, saying that the vine bears three clusters of grapes: the first wine, pleasure; the second, drunkenness; the third, disgust. So he became a kind of <a href="emblem">emblem</a> to the Athenians, who inscribed on his statues: 'Restrain your tongues, your appetites, your passions.'

There are ten extant letters ascribed to him, one of which is also quoted by <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>:
Greetings from Anacharsis to Hanno: My clothing is a Scythian cloak, my shoes are the hard soles of my feet, my bed is the earth, my food is only seasoned by hunger - and I eat nothing but milk and cheese and meat. Come and visit me, and you will find me at peace. You want to give me something. But give it to your fellow-citizens instead, or let the immortal gods have it.
All of the letters are spurious. The first nine probably date from the 3rd century BC, they are usually included among the "<a href="Cynic%20epistles">Cynic epistles</a>", and reflect how the Cynic philosophers viewed him as prefiguring many of their ideas; the tenth letter is quoted by <a href="Diogenes%20Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a>, it is addressed to <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a>, the proverbially rich king of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>, it too is fictitious: 
Anacharsis to Croesus: O king of the Lydians, I am come to the country of the Greeks, in order to become acquainted with their customs and institutions; but I have no need of gold, and shall be quite contented if I return to Scythia a better man than I left it. However I will come to Sardis, as I think it very desirable to become a friend of yours.

<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> makes him the (probably legendary) inventor of the <a href="anchor">anchor</a> with two flukes, and others made him the inventor of the <a href="potter%27s%20wheel">potter's wheel</a>.

Having been informed that <a href="Solon">Solon</a> was employed to draw up a code of laws for the <a href="Athenians">Athenians</a>, Anacharsis described his occupation, saying:

In 1788 <a href="Jean%20Jacques%20Barthelemy">Jean Jacques Barthelemy</a> (1716–95), a highly esteemed classical scholar and Jesuit, published "The Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Greece," about a young <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>n descended from Anacharsis. The 4-volume work was an imaginary <a href="travel%20journal">travel journal</a>, one of the first <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>s, which Klemperer called "the encyclopedia of the new cult of the antique" in the late 18th century. It affected the growth of <a href="philhellenism">philhellenism</a> in France at the time. The book went through many editions, was reprinted in the United States and translated into German and other languages.

Anah

Anah or Ana (, "ʾĀna"), formerly also known as Anna, is an <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i town on the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> river, approximately midway between the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alexandretta">Gulf of Alexandretta</a> and the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. Anah lies from west to east on the right bank along a bend of the river just before it turns south towards <a href="H%C4%ABt">Hit</a>.

The town is called Ha-na-at in a <a href="Babylonian%20language">Babylonian</a> letter around 2200 , A-na-at by the scribes of <a href="Tukulti-Ninurta%20II">Tukulti-Ninurta</a>  , and An-at by the scribes of <a href="Assur-nasir-pal%20II">Assur-nasir-pal II</a> in 879 . The name has been connected with the widely worshipped war goddess <a href="Anat">Anat</a>. It was known as "Anathō" () to <a href="Isidore%20Charax">Isidore Charax</a> and "" to <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a>; early Arabic writers described it variously as "ʾĀna" or (as if plural) "ʾĀnāt".

Despite maintaining its name across 42 centuries, the exact location of the settlement seems to have moved from time to time. Sources across most of its early history, however, place Anah on an island in the Euphrates.

Its early history under the Babylonians is uncertain. A 3rd-millennium  letter mentions six "men of Hanat" are mentioned in a description of disturbances in the Residency of Suhi, which would have included the district of Anah. It is probably not the place mentioned by <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a> in the 16th century  or in the speech of <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a>'s messengers to <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>, but probably was the site "in the middle of the Euphrates" opposite which Assur-nasir-pal II halted during his 879  campaign. It may also be mentioned in four 7th-century  documents edited by <a href="Claude%20Hermann%20Walter%20Johns">Claude Hermann Walter Johns</a>.

<a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> records that the army of Cyrus resupplied during a campaign in 401  at "Charmande" near the end of a 90-<a href="parasang">parasang</a> march between <a href="Korsote">Korsote</a> and <a href="Pylae">Pylae</a>, which likely intends Anah. It was the site where <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian</a> first met opposition in his  363 expedition against <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthia</a>. He got possession of the place and relocated its inhabitants.

In 657, during the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Iraq">Muslim conquest of Iraq</a>, <a href="Ali">Ali</a>'s lieutenants Ziyad and <a href="Shureih">Shureih</a> were refused passage across the Euphrates at Anah. Later, in 1058, Anah was the place of exile of the caliph <a href="Al-Qa%27im%20%28caliph%29">Qaim</a> when <a href="al-Basasiri">al-Basasiri</a> was in power. In the 14th century, Anah was the seat of the <a href="catholicos">catholicos</a> who served as <a href="primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a> over the Persian Christians. Throughout early Islamic rule, it was a prosperous trade town, well known for its date palms and gardens; in the 14th century, Mustafi wrote of the fame of its palm groves. Medieval <a href="Arabic%20poetry">Arab poets</a> celebrated Anah's wine;

Between the 14th and 17th centuries, Anah served as a headquarters for a host of regional <a href="Arab">Arab</a> tribes. In 1574, <a href="Leonhart%20Rauwolff">Leonhart Rauwolff</a> found the town divided into two parts, the Turkish "so surrounded by the river that you cannot go into it but by boats" and the larger Arabian section along one of the banks. In 1610, <a href="Texeira">Texeira</a> said Anah lay on both banks of the river, with which <a href="Pietro%20Della%20Valle">Pietro Della Valle</a> agreed. In that year, Della Valle found the Scot George Strachan resident at Anah, working as the physician to the emir and studying Arabic; he also found some sun worshipers still living there. Della Valle and Texeira called Anah the principal Arab town on the Euphrates, controlling a major route west from <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and territory reaching <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a>.

About 1750, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a>s installed a rudimentary administration to run Anah and its district. After roughly a century, a more organized local government was put in place, whereby Anah became the center of a <a href="kaza">kaza</a> belonging to the <a href="Baghdad%20Vilayet">Baghdad Vilayet</a>.

At the beginning of the 19th century, <a href="G.A.%20Olivier">G.A. Olivier</a> found only 25 men in service of the local prince, with residents fleeing daily to escape from <a href="bedouin">bedouin</a> attacks against which he offered no protection. He described the city as a single long street of five or six miles along a narrow strip of land between the river and a ridge of rocky hills. <a href="W.%20F.%20Ainsworth">W. F. Ainsworth</a>, chronicling the <a href="English%20Euphrates%20expedition">English Euphrates expedition</a>, reported that in 1835 the Arabs inhabited the northwest part of the town, the Christians the center, and the Jews the southeast. The same year, the steamer "Tigris" went down in a storm just above Anah, near where Julian's force had suffered from a similar storm.

By the mid-19th century, the houses were separated from one another by fruit gardens, which also filled the riverine islands near the town. The most easterly island contained a ruined castle, while the ruins of ancient Anatho extended a further 2 miles along the left bank. It marked the boundary between the olive (north) and date (south) growing regions in the area. With the positioning of Turkish troops in the town around 1890, the locals no longer had to pay blackmail ("huwwa") to the bedouins. Through the early 20th century, coarse cotton cloth was the only manufacture. In 1909 Anah had an estimated population of 15,000 and 2,000 houses. Most of the inhabitants were <a href="Sunni%20Muslim">Sunni Muslim</a> Arabs, though a small Jewish community lived in the town's southern edge.

In 1918, the town was captured by British forces and by 1921, became incorporated into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Iraq">Kingdom of Iraq</a>. It remained an administrative center of a <a href="qadaa">qadaa</a>, part of the larger <a href="Ramadi">Ramadi</a>-based <a href="Sanjak">liwa</a> of Dulaym. Anah's "qadaa" also included the subdistricts of <a href="H%C4%ABt">Hīt</a>, <a href="al-Qa%27im%20%28town%29">al-Qa'im</a> and Jubba. The townspeople's long feud with the inhabitants of <a href="Rawa%2C%20Iraq">Rawa</a> was settled diplomatically by 1921. Its territory to the west was dominated by the subtribes of <a href="Anizzah">Anizzah</a>, while to the east the Jarba branch of the <a href="Shammar">Shammar</a> held sway.

Most of Anah's building were located among a dense belt of date palms and was "reckoned as healthy and picturesque", according to historian S. H. Longrigg. The date palms were irrigated by <a href="na%27ura">water wheel</a>s. There were also more scattered dwelling in the mid-stream islands of the Euphrates near the town center. The women of the town were well known for their beauty and the weaving of cotton and wool textiles. The men, many of whom were compelled to emigrate to lack of living space, were largely engaged as boatmen and transporters of water to Baghdad. The town had relatively high educational standards, with eight schools built there by 1946.

<a href="F.%20R.%20Chesney">F. R. Chesney</a> reported about 1800 houses, 2 <a href="mosque">mosque</a>s, and 16 waterwheels. One minaret is particularly old. <a href="Alastair%20Northedge">Northedge</a> reported the locals commonly attributed it to the 11th century but opined that it was more likely from about a century after that. It rose from one of the islands and belonged to the local mosque. Dr. Muayad Said described it as an octagonal body "enhanced by alcoves, some of which are blind" and noted earlier conservation work undertaken in 1935, 1963 and 1964. When the valley was flooded by the <a href="Haditha%20Dam">Haditha Dam</a> in 1984 and '85, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities cut it into sections and removed it to the new Anah, where it was re-erected to a height of at the end of the 1980s.

<a href="Islamic%20State%20in%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIS</a> captured the town in 2014.
In September, 2017, the town was recaptured by the Iraqi army.

Ananda

Ānanda was a first cousin of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a> and one of his <a href="the%20ten%20principal%20disciples">ten principal disciples</a>. Amongst the Buddha's many disciples, Ānanda stood out for having the most retentive memory. Most of the <a href="sutra">sutra</a>s of the "<a href="Sutta%20Pitaka">Sutta Pitaka</a>" are attributed to his recollection of the Buddha's teachings during the <a href="First%20Buddhist%20council">First Buddhist council</a>. For that reason, he was known as the "Guardian of the Dharma".

According to Buddhist tradition, every Buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry. In the case of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, the pair of disciples were <a href="Sariputta">Sariputta</a> and <a href="Maudgalyayana">Maudgalyayana</a> and the attendant was Ānanda.

The word 'Ānanda' means <a href="wikt%3Abliss">'bliss'</a> in <a href="Pali">Pali</a>, <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> as well as other Indian languages. It is a popular name in <a href="India">India</a> and south-east Asia, especially <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.

In the Kannakatthala Sutta (<a href="Majjhima%20Nikaya">MN 90</a>), Ananda is identified with the meaning of his name:

Ānanda was the first <a href="cousin">cousin</a> of the <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a> by their fathers, and was devoted to him. In the twentieth year of the Buddha's ministry, he became the Buddha's personal attendant, accompanying him on most of his wanderings and taking the part of <a href="Interlocutor%20%28linguistics%29">interlocutor</a> in many of the recorded <a href="dialogues">dialogues</a>. He is the subject of a special <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> delivered by the Buddha just before the Buddha's <a href="parinibbana">parinibbana</a> (the <a href="Mahaparinibbana%20Sutta">Mahaparinibbana Sutta</a> (<a href="Digha%20Nikaya">DN</a> 16)); it is a panegyric for a man who is kindly, unselfish, popular, and thoughtful toward others.

In the long list of the disciples given in the <a href="Anguttara%20Nikaya">Anguttara Nikaya</a> (i. xiv.), where each of them is declared to be Prime in some quality, Ānanda is mentioned five times (more often than any other). He was named Prime in conduct, in service to others, and in power of <a href="memory">memory</a>. The Buddha sometimes asked Ānanda to substitute for him as teacher and then later stated that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other way.

The Buddhist canon attributes the inclusion of women in the early Sangha (monastic order) to Ānanda. The Buddha conceded and permitted his step-mother <a href="Mahapajapati">Mahapajapati</a> to be ordained as a <a href="bhikkhuni">bhikkhuni</a> only after Ananda prevailed upon the Buddha to publicly recognize women as being equal to men in possessing the potential for awakening. Following the death of the Buddha, Ananda was criticized by the members of the Sangha for having enabled women to join the monastic order.

Because he attended the Buddha personally and often traveled with him, Ānanda overheard and memorized many of the discourses the Buddha delivered to various audiences. Therefore, he is often referred to as the disciple of the Buddha who "heard much". At the <a href="Buddhist%20councils">First Buddhist Council</a>, convened shortly after the Buddha died, Ananda was called upon to recite many of the discourses that later became the <a href="Sutta%20Pitaka">Sutta Pitaka</a> of the <a href="P%C4%81li%20Canon">Pāli Canon</a>.

Despite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha, Ananda was only a <a href="Sotapanna">stream-winner</a> prior to the Buddha’s death. However, Buddha said that the purity of his heart was so great that, "Should Ananda die without being fully liberated, he would be king of the Gods seven times because of the purity of his heart, or be king of the Indian subcontinent seven times. But...Ananda will experience final liberation in this very life." (<a href="Anguttara%20Nikaya">AN</a> 3.80)

Prior to the First Buddhist Council, it was proposed that Ananda not be permitted to attend on the grounds that he was not yet an <a href="arahant">arahant</a>. According to legend, this prompted Ananda to focus his efforts on the attainment of <a href="nibbana">nibbana</a> and he was able to reach the specified level of attainment before the convening of the conclave.

In contrast to most of the figures depicted in the <a href="P%C4%81li%20Canon">Pāli Canon</a>, Ananda is presented as an imperfect, if sympathetic, figure. He mourns the deaths of both <a href="Sariputta">Sariputta</a>, with whom he enjoyed a close friendship, and the <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a>. A verse of the <a href="Theragatha">Theragatha</a> reveals his loneliness and isolation following the <a href="parinirvana">parinirvana</a> (salvation/demise) of the Buddha.

In the <a href="Zen">Zen</a> tradition, Ananda is considered to be the second Indian patriarch. He is often depicted with the Buddha alongside <a href="Mahakashyapa">Mahakashyapa</a>, the first Indian patriarch.

Ananda attains <a href="parinirvana">parinirvana</a> (salvation) in midair over the river <a href="Ganga">Ganga</a>. His body gets auto-cremated and his relics divide into four portions for the people of Rajargrha, the people of Vaisali, the <a href="N%C4%81ga">Nagas</a> and the Gods.

Born in <a href="Clazomenae">Clazomenae</a> in the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> (modern-day <a href="Urla%2C%20%C4%B0zmir">Urla</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>) Anaxagoras was the first to bring philosophy to <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. According to <a href="Diogenes%20Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a> and <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, in later life he was charged with <a href="impiety">impiety</a> and went into exile in <a href="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a>; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a>, if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.

Responding to the claims of <a href="Parmenides">Parmenides</a> on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it". He introduced the concept of "<a href="Nous">Nous</a>" (Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was <a href="homogeneous">homogeneous</a>, or nearly so.

He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He produced a correct explanation for <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s and described the sun as a fiery mass larger than the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, as well as attempting to explain <a href="rainbows">rainbows</a> and <a href="meteors">meteors</a>.

Anaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of <a href="Clazomenae">Clazomenae</a>, in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. However, he supposedly surrendered this out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge. The Roman author <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a> preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: "If this had not perished, I would have"—a sentence described by Valerius as being "possessed of sought-after wisdom!" Although a Greek, he may have been a soldier of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> army when Clazomenae was suppressed during the <a href="Ionian%20Revolt">Ionian Revolt</a>.

In early manhood (461 BC) he went to <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, which was rapidly becoming the centre of <a href="Culture%20of%20Greece">Greek culture</a>. There he is said to have remained for thirty years. <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> learned to love and admire him, and the poet <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> to Athens. His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to a putative prediction of the impact of a meteorite in 467 BC. He attempted to give a scientific account of <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s, <a href="meteor">meteor</a>s, <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a>s, and the <a href="sun">sun</a>, which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation. He explained that, though both sun and the stars were fiery stones, we do not feel the heat of the stars because of their enormous distance from earth. He was the first to explain that the moon shines by reflecting the sun's light. He thought that the earth is flat and floats supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes causes earthquakes. These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety. <a href="Diogenes%20Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a> reports the story that he was prosecuted by Cleon for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent his former tutor, Anaxagoras, to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the <a href="Peloponnesian%20war">Peloponnesian war</a>.

According to Laertius, Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial, BC. Even so, Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to <a href="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a> in <a href="Troad">Troad</a> (433 BC). He died there in around the year 428 BC. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years.

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of <a href="Simplicius%20of%20Cilicia">Simplicius of Cilicia</a> in the 6th century AD.

According to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form. There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts () as well as heterogeneous ones.

The work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of <a href="Nous">Mind or Reason</a> (). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life. Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion. It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts.

Decease and growth represent a new aggregation () and disruption (). However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome. Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character. Out of this process arises the things we see in this world.

In a quote chosen to begin <a href="Nathanael%20West">Nathanael West</a>'s first book "<a href="The%20Dream%20Life%20of%20Balso%20Snell">The Dream Life of Balso Snell</a>", <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s character Bergotte says, "After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey."

Anaxagoras appears as a character in "<a href="Faust%2C%20Part%20Two">Faust, Part II</a>" by <a href="Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>.

Anaxagoras appears as a character in "The Ionia Sanction", by <a href="Gary%20Corby">Gary Corby</a>.

Anaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of "<a href="Creation%20%28novel%29">Creation</a>", by <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:

<a href="William%20H.%20Gass">William H. Gass</a> begins his novel, "The Tunnel" (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: "The descent to hell is the same from every place."

Anaxagoras is mentioned by <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> during his trial in <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s "<a href="Apology%20%28Plato%29">Apology</a>".

<a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his "<a href="Divine_Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>" ("<a href="Inferno_%28Dante%29">Inferno</a>", Canto IV, line 118).

Anaxarchus

Anaxarchus (; ; c. 380 – c. 320 BC) was a <a href="Greek%20people">Greek</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> of the school of <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>. Together with <a href="Pyrrho">Pyrrho</a>, he accompanied <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> into Asia. The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of <a href="Pyrrhonism">Pyrrhonism</a>.

Anaxarchus was born at <a href="Abdera%2C%20Thrace">Abdera</a> in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. He was the companion and friend of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> in his Asiatic campaigns. According to <a href="Diogenes%20Laertius">Diogenes Laertius</a>, in response to Alexander's claim to have been the son of Zeus-Ammon, Anaxarchus pointed to his bleeding wound and remarked, "See the blood of a mortal, not <a href="ichor">ichor</a>, such as flows from the veins of the immortal gods."

<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> tells a story that at <a href="Bactra">Bactra</a>, in 327 BC in a debate with <a href="Callisthenes">Callisthenes</a>, he advised all to worship Alexander as a god even during his lifetime, is with greater probability attributed to the Sicilian <a href="Cleon">Cleon</a>.

When Alexander was trying to show that he is divine so that the Greeks and Macedonians would perform proskynesis to him, Anaxarchus said that Alexander could "more justly be considered a god than Dionysus or Heracles" (Arrian, 104)

Diogenes Laertius says that <a href="Nicocreon">Nicocreon</a>, the tyrant of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, commanded him to be pounded to death in a mortar, and that he endured this torture with fortitude and <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> relates the same story.

Very little is known about his philosophical views. It is thought that he represents a link between the <a href="atomism">atomism</a> of <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>, and the <a href="Pyrrhonism">skepticism</a> of <a href="Pyrrho">Pyrrho</a>.

Anaxarchus is said to have studied under <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Smyrna">Diogenes of Smyrna</a>, who in turn studied under <a href="Metrodorus%20of%20Chios">Metrodorus of Chios</a>, who used to declare that he knew nothing, not even the fact that he knew nothing. According to <a href="Sextus%20Empiricus">Sextus Empiricus</a>, Anaxarchus "compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness." Anaxarchus's student Pyrrho is said to have adopted "a most noble philosophy, . . . taking the form of agnosticism and suspension of judgement." Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho's "indifference and sang-froid." Anaxarchus is said to have possessed "fortitude and contentment in life," which earned him the epithet "eudaimonikos" ("fortunate"), which may imply that he held the end of life to be "<a href="eudaimonia">eudaimonia</a>."

<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> reports that he told <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> that there was an infinite number of worlds, causing the latter to become dejected because he had not yet conquered even one.

Ancyra is a genus of southeast Asian <a href="planthopper">planthopper</a>s. Members of the genus are well known for having a pair of prolonged filaments at the tips of the forewings that arise near a pair of small glossy spots; this creates the impression of a pair of antennae, with corresponding "eyes" (a remarkable case of <a href="automimicry">automimicry</a>). The "false head" effect is further reinforced by the bugs' habit of walking backwards when it detects movement nearby, so as to misdirect predators to strike at its rear, rather than at its actual head.

Anaximenes of Lampsacus

Anaximenes of <a href="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a> () (320 BC) was a <a href="Classical%20Greece">Greek</a> <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>ian and historian.

Anaximenes was a pupil of <a href="Zoilus">Zoilus</a> and, like his teacher, wrote a work on <a href="Homer">Homer</a>. As a rhetorician, he was a determined opponent of <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a> and his school. He is generally regarded as the author of the "<a href="Rhetoric%20to%20Alexander">Rhetoric to Alexander</a>", an "Art of Rhetoric" included in the traditional <a href="Corpus%20Aristotelicum">corpus</a> of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s works. <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a> seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes' name in "Institutio Oratoria" <a href="http%3A//honeyl.public.iastate.edu/quintilian/3/chapter4.html%239">3.4.9</a>, as the Italian Renaissance philologist <a href="Piero%20Vettori">Piero Vettori</a> first recognized. This attribution has, however, been disputed by some scholars.

The <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DUdyFQ4a9HOMC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPR58%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse">hypothesis</a> to Isocrates' "Helen" mentions that Anaximenes, too, had written a "Helen", "though it is more a defense speech ("apologia") than an <a href="encomium">encomium</a>," and concludes that he was "the man who has written about Helen" to whom Isocrates refers (Isoc. "Helen" 14). <a href="Richard%20Claverhouse%20Jebb">Jebb</a> entertained the possibility that this work survives in the form of the "<a href="Encomium%20of%20Helen">Encomium of Helen</a>" ascribed to <a href="Gorgias">Gorgias</a>: "It appears not improbable that Anaximenes may have been the real author of the work ascribed to Gorgias."

According to <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> (<a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DhsLNAAAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA310%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse">6.18.6</a>), Anaximenes was "the first who practised the art of speaking <a href="Extemporaneous%20speaking">extemporaneously</a>." He also worked as a <a href="Logographer%20%28legal%29">logographer</a>, having written the speech prosecuting <a href="Phryne">Phryne</a> according to Diodorus Periegetes (quoted by <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a> <a href="http%3A//www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus13c.html%23591">XIII.591e</a>). The "ethical" fragments preserved in <a href="Stobaeus">Stobaeus</a>' "Florilegium" may represent "some philosophical book."

Anaximenes wrote a history of Greece in twelve books, stretching from the gods' origins to the death of <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mantinea%20%28362%20BC%29">Battle of Mantinea</a> ("Hellenica", ), and a history of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip of Macedon</a> ("Philippica"). He was a favorite of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns, and wrote a third historical work on Alexander (however, Pausanias <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DhsLNAAAAMAAJ%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA310%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3D%26amp%3Bf%3Dfalse">6.18.6</a> expresses doubt about his authorship of an <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a> on Alexander). He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandrian</a> canon.

<a href="Didymus%20Chalcenterus">Didymus</a> reports that the work transmitted as speech 11 of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> ("Against the Letter of Philip") could be found in almost identical form in pageRank.Book 7 of Anaximenes' "Philippica", and many scholars regard the work as a historiographic composition by Anaximenes. The "Letter of Philip" (speech 12) to which speech 11 seems to respond may also be by Anaximenes, or it may be an authentic letter by Philip, perhaps written with the aid of his advisers. The more ambitious theory of Wilhelm Nitsche, which assigned to Anaximenes a larger part of the Demosthenic corpus (speeches 10-13 and 25, letters 1-4, proems), can be rejected.

Anaximenes was hostile to <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>, whom he sought to discredit with a libelous parody, "Trikaranos", published in Theopompus' style and under his name, attacking Athens, Sparta, and Thebes.

<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> criticizes Anaximenes, together with Theopompus and <a href="Ephorus">Ephorus</a>, for the "rhetorical effects and grand <a href="Periodic%20sentence">periods</a>" these historians implausibly gave to men in the midst of urgent battlefield circumstances ("Praecepta gerendae reipublicae" <a href="http%3A//penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Praecepta_gerendae_reipublicae%2A.html%23T803b">803b</a>).

Anaximenes of Miletus

Anaximenes of <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> (; ; c. 585 – c. 528 BCE) was an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="Pre-Socratic">Pre-Socratic</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> active in the latter half of the 6th century BC. One of the three <a href="Milesian%20School">Milesian</a> philosophers, he is identified as a younger friend or student of <a href="Anaximander">Anaximander</a>. Anaximenes, like others in his school of thought, practiced <a href="material%20monism">material monism</a>. This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing is what Anaximenes is principally known for today.

While his predecessors <a href="Thales">Thales</a> and Anaximander proposed that the "<a href="arche">archai</a>" (<a href="grammatical%20number">singular</a>: "arche", meaning the underlying material of the world) were water and the ambiguous substance "<a href="Apeiron%20%28cosmology%29">apeiron</a>", respectively, Anaximenes asserted that air was this primary substance of which all other things are made. The choice of air may seem arbitrary, but Anaximenes based his conclusion on naturally observable phenomena in the processes of <a href="rarefaction">rarefaction</a> and <a href="condensation">condensation</a>. When air condenses it becomes visible, as mist and then rain and other forms of precipitation. As the condensed air cools Anaximenes supposed that it went on to form earth and ultimately stones. In contrast, water evaporates into air, which ignites and produces flame when further rarefied. While other philosophers also recognized such transitions in states of matter, Anaximenes was the first to associate the quality pairs hot/dry and cold/wet with the density of a single material and add a quantitative dimension to the Milesian <a href="material%20monism">monistic system</a>.

Having concluded that everything in the world is composed of air, Anaximenes used his theory to devise a scheme that explains the origins and nature of the earth and the surrounding celestial bodies. Air felted to create the flat disk of the earth, which he said was table-like and behaved like a leaf floating on air. In keeping with the prevailing view of celestial bodies as balls of fire in the sky, Anaximenes proposed that the earth let out an exhalation of air that rarefied, ignited and became the stars. While the sun is similarly described as being aflame, it is not composed of rarefied air like the stars, but rather of earth like the moon; its burning comes not from its composition but rather from its rapid motion. Similarly, he considered the moon and sun to be flat and floating on streams of air. In his theory, when the sun sets it does not pass under the earth, but is merely obscured by higher parts of the earth as it circles around and becomes more distant. Anaximenes likens the motion of the sun and the other celestial bodies around the earth to the way that a cap may be turned around the head.

Anaximenes used his observations and reasoning to provide causes for other natural phenomena on the earth as well. <a href="Earthquakes">Earthquakes</a>, he asserted, were the result either of lack of moisture, which causes the earth to break apart because of how parched it is, or of superabundance of water, which also causes cracks in the earth. In either case the earth becomes weakened by its cracks, so that hills collapse and cause earthquakes. <a href="Lightning">Lightning</a> is similarly caused by the violent separation of clouds by the wind, creating a bright, fire-like flash. <a href="Rainbows">Rainbows</a>, on the other hand, are formed when densely compressed air is touched by the rays of the sun. These examples show how Anaximenes, like the other <a href="Milesian%20school">Milesian philosophers</a>, looked for the broader picture in nature. They sought unifying causes for diversely occurring events, rather than treating each one on a case-by-case basis, or attributing them to gods or to a personified <a href="nature">nature</a>.

The <a href="Anaximenes%20%28crater%29">Anaximenes</a> crater on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> is named in his honor.

Ancus Marcius

Ancus Marcius (–617 BC ; reigned 642–617 BC) was the <a href="Roman%20mythology">legendary</a> fourth <a href="king%20of%20Rome">king of Rome</a>. He was the son of Marcius (whose father, also named Marcius, had been a close friend of Numa Pompilius), who may be identified with <a href="Numa%20Marcius">Numa Marcius</a>, and Pompilia (daughter of <a href="Numa%20Pompilius">Numa Pompilius</a>). According to <a href="Festus%20%28historian%29">Festus</a>, Marcius had the surname of "Ancus" from his "crooked" arm. Upon the death of the previous king, <a href="Tullus%20Hostilius">Tullus Hostilius</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> appointed an <a href="interrex">interrex</a>, who in turn called a session of the <a href="Roman%20assemblies">assembly of the people</a> who elected the new king.

Ancus Marcius was believed by the Romans to have been the namesake of the <a href="Marcia%20%28gens%29">Marcii</a>, a Plebeian family.
According to <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, his first act as king was to order the <a href="Pontifex%20Maximus">Pontifex Maximus</a> to copy the text concerning the performance of public ceremonies of religion from the commentaries of Numa Pompilius to be displayed to the public, so that the rites of religion should no longer be neglected or improperly performed.

He waged <a href="Latin%20League%23First%20war%20with%20Rome">war</a> successfully against the <a href="Latin%20League">Latins</a>, and a number of them were settled on the <a href="Aventine%20Hill">Aventine Hill</a>. According to <a href="Livy">Livy</a> the war was commenced by the Latins who anticipated Ancus would follow the pious pursuit of peace adopted by his grandfather, <a href="Numa%20Pompilius">Numa Pompilius</a>. The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands. When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage, the Latins gave a contemptuous reply. Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins. The declaration is notable since, according to Livy, it was the first time that the Romans had declared war by means of the rites of the <a href="fetial">fetial</a>s.

Ancus Marcius marched from Rome with a newly levied army and took the Latin town of <a href="Politorium">Politorium</a> (situated near the town of <a href="Lanuvium">Lanuvium</a>) by storm. Its residents were removed to settle on the <a href="Aventine%20Hill">Aventine Hill</a> in Rome as new citizens, following the Roman traditions from wars with the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a> and <a href="Alba%20Longa">Albans</a>. When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium, Ancus took the town again and demolished it. The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished.

The war then focused on the Latin town of <a href="Medullia">Medullia</a>. The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified. Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious. Ancus returned to Rome with much booty. More Latins were brought to Rome as citizens and were settled at the foot of the Aventine near the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, by the temple of <a href="Murcia%20%28mythology%29">Murcia</a>. 
Ancus Marcius incorporated the <a href="Janiculum">Janiculum</a> into the city, fortifying it with a wall and connecting it with the city by a wooden bridge across the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>, the <a href="Pons%20Sublicius">Pons Sublicius</a>. 
On the land side of the city he constructed the <a href="Fossa%20Quiritium">Fossa Quiritium</a>, a ditch fortification. He also built Rome's first prison, the <a href="Mamertine%20Prison">Mamertine prison</a>.

He extended Roman territory to the sea, founding the port of <a href="Ostia%20Antica%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Ostia</a>, establishing salt-works around the port, and taking the Silva Maesia, an area of coastal forest north of the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>, from the <a href="Veii">Veientes</a>. 
He expanded the temple of <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter Feretrius</a> to reflect these territorial successes. 
According to a reconstruction of the <a href="Fasti%20Triumphales">Fasti Triumphales</a>, Ancus Marcius celebrated at least one triumph, over the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a> and Veientes.

Ancus Marcius was succeeded by <a href="Lucius%20Tarquinius%20Priscus">Lucius Tarquinius Priscus</a> who would later be executed by the sons of Ancus Marcius. Patrician Marcius Rex -family is descended from Ancus Marcius and remained prominent during the republic and empire.

The Andaman Islands are home to the <a href="Sentinelese">Sentinelese</a>, who have had little contact with any other people.

The name of the Andaman Islands is ancient..

Another Italian traveller, <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20de%27%20Conti">Niccolò de' Conti</a> (), mentioned the islands and said that the name means "Island of Gold".

The Andaman islands have been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. The earliest <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> evidence yet documented goes back some 2,200 years; however, the indications from <a href="genetics">genetic</a>, <a href="culture">cultural</a> and isolation studies suggest that the islands may have been inhabited as early as the <a href="Middle%20Paleolithic">Middle Paleolithic</a>. The indigenous <a href="Andamanese%20people">Andamanese people</a> appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century CE.

The Andamans are theorised to be a key stepping stone in a <a href="Great%20Coastal%20Migration">great coastal migration</a> of humans from <a href="Africa">Africa</a> via the <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>, along the coastal regions of the Indian mainland and towards <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>.
From 800 to 1200 CE, the <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil</a> <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola dynasty</a> created an empire that eventually extended from southeastern peninsular India to parts of <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. <a href="Rajendra%20Chola%20I">Rajendra Chola I</a> (1014 to 1042 CE) took over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and maintained them as a strategic naval base to launch a naval expedition against the <a href="Srivijaya">Srivijaya empire</a> (a Buddhist-<a href="Malay%20People">Malay</a> empire based on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia).

In 1789, the <a href="Bengal%20Presidency">Bengal Presidency</a> established a naval base and <a href="penal%20colony">penal colony</a> on <a href="Chatham%20Island%20%28Andaman%29">Chatham Island</a> in the southeast bay of <a href="South%20Andaman%20Island">Great Andaman</a>. The settlement is now known as <a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a> (after the <a href="Bombay%20Marine">Bombay Marine</a> lieutenant <a href="Archibald%20Blair">Archibald Blair</a> who founded it). After two years, the colony was moved to the northeast part of <a href="North%20Andaman%20Island">Great Andaman</a> and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral <a href="William%20Cornwallis">William Cornwallis</a>. However, there was much disease and death in the penal colony and the government ceased operating it in May 1796.

In 1824, Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the <a href="First%20Burmese%20War">First Burmese War</a>. In the 1830s and 1840s, shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives and the islands had a reputation for cannibalism. The loss of the "Runnymede" and the "Briton" in 1844 during the same storm, while transporting goods and passengers between India and Australia, and the continuous attacks launched by the natives, which the survivors fought off, alarmed the British government. In 1855, the government proposed another settlement on the islands, including a <a href="Cellular%20Jail">convict establishment</a>, but the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a> forced a delay in its construction. However, because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners, it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary. Construction began in November 1857 at Port Blair using inmates' labour, avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp that seemed to have been the source of many of the earlier problems at Port Cornwallis.

17 May 1859 was another major day for Andaman. The "Battle of Aberdeen" was fought between the Great Andamanese Tribe and the British. Today, a memorial stands in Andaman Water sports complex as a tribute to the people who lost their lives. Fearing foreign invasion and with help from an escaped convict from Cellular Jail, the great Andamanese tribe stormed the British post, but they were outnumbered and soon suffered heavy loss of life. Later, it was identified that an escaped convict named Doodnath had changed sides and informed the British about the tribe's plans. Today, the tribe has been reduced to some 50 people, with less than 50% of them adults. The government of Andaman Islands is making efforts to increase the headcount of this tribe.
In 1867, the ship "Nineveh" wrecked on the reef of <a href="North%20Sentinel%20Island">North Sentinel Island</a>. The 86 survivors reached the beach in the ship's boats. On the third day, they were attacked with iron-tipped spears by naked islanders. One person from the ship escaped in a boat and the others were later rescued by a British Royal Navy ship.

For some time, sickness and mortality were high, but <a href="Land%20reclamation">swamp reclamation</a> and extensive forest clearance continued. The Andaman colony became notorious with the murder of the Viceroy <a href="Richard%20Southwell%20Bourke%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Mayo">Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo</a>, on a visit to the settlement (8 February 1872), by a Muslim convict, a <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pathan</a> from <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, Sher Ali. In the same year, the two island groups Andaman and <a href="Nicobar%20Islands">Nicobar</a>, were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair.
From the time of its development in 1858 under the direction of James Pattison Walker, and in response to the mutiny and rebellion of the previous year, the settlement was first and foremost a repository for <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s. The <a href="Cellular%20Jail">Cellular Jail</a> at Port Blair when completed in 1910 included 698 cells designed for solitary confinement; each cell measured with a single ventilation window above the floor. A notable prisoner there was <a href="Vinayak%20Damodar%20Savarkar">Vinayak Damodar Savarkar</a>.

The Indians imprisoned here referred to the Island and its prison as "Kala Pani" ("black water"); a 1996 film set on the island took that term as its title "<a href="Kaalapani%20%281996%20film%29">Kaalapani</a>". The number of prisoners who died in this camp is estimated to be in the thousands. Many more died of harsh treatment and the harsh living and working conditions in this camp.

The Viper Chain Gang Jail on <a href="Viper%20Island">Viper Island</a> was reserved for troublemakers, and was also the site of hangings. In the 20th century, it became a convenient place to house prominent members of India's independence movement.

The Andaman and Nicobar islands were <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Andaman%20Islands">occupied by Japan</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The islands were nominally put under the authority of the <a href="Arzi%20Hukumat-e-Azad%20Hind">Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind</a> (Provisional Government of Free India) headed by <a href="Subhas%20Chandra%20Bose">Subhas Chandra Bose</a>, who visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as <a href="Shahid">Shaheed</a> (Martyr) & Swaraj (Self-rule). On 30 December 1943, during the Japanese occupation, Bose, who was allied with the Japanese, first raised the flag of Indian independence. General <a href="A.%20D.%20Loganathan">Loganathan</a>, of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Army">Indian National Army</a>, was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been annexed to the Provisional Government. According to Werner Gruhl: "Before leaving the islands, the Japanese rounded up and <a href="Japanese%20war%20crimes">executed 750 innocents</a>." After the end of the war the islands returned to British control before becoming part of the newly independent state of India.

At the close of World War II, the British government announced its intention to abolish the penal settlement. The government proposed to employ former inmates in an initiative to develop the island's fisheries, timber, and agricultural resources. In exchange, inmates would be granted return passage to the Indian mainland, or the right to settle on the islands. The penal colony was eventually closed on 15 August 1947 when India gained independence. It has since served as a museum to the independence movement.

In April 1998, American photographer John S Callahan organised the first surfing project in the Andamans, starting from <a href="Phuket%20Province">Phuket</a> in Thailand with the assistance of Southeast Asia Liveaboards (SEAL), a UK owned dive charter company. With a crew of international professional surfers, they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht "Crescent" and cleared formalities in Port Blair. The group proceeded to Little Andaman Island, where they spent ten days surfing several spots for the first time, including Jarawa Point near Hut Bay and the long right reef point at the southwest tip of the island, named Kumari Point. The resulting article in "Surfer Magazine", "Quest for Fire" by journalist Sam George, put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time. Footage of the waves of the Andaman Islands also appeared in the film "Thicker than Water", shot by <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a>maker <a href="Jack%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Jack Johnson</a>, who later achieved worldwide fame as a popular musician. Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans, including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999.

On 26 December 2004, the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a high tsunami following the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>, which is the longest recorded earthquake, lasting for between 500 and 600 seconds. Strong oral traditions in the area warned of the importance of moving inland after a quake and is credited with saving many lives. In the aftermath, more than 2,000 people were confirmed dead and more than 4,000 children were orphaned or had lost one parent. At least 40,000 residents were rendered homeless and were moved to relief camps. On 11 August 2009, a magnitude 7 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands, causing a tsunami warning to go into effect. On 30 March 2010, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands.

The Andaman Archipelago is an oceanic continuation of the Burmese <a href="Chin%20Hills">Arakan Yoma range</a> in the North and of the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesian Archipelago</a> in the South. It has 325 islands which cover an area of , with the <a href="Andaman%20Sea">Andaman Sea</a> to the east between the islands and the coast of Burma. <a href="North%20Andaman%20Island">North Andaman Island</a> is south of Burma, although a few smaller Burmese islands are closer, including the three Coco Islands.

The <a href="Ten%20Degree%20Channel">Ten Degree Channel</a> separates the Andamans from the <a href="Nicobar%20Islands">Nicobar Islands</a> to the south. The highest point is located in North Andaman Island (<a href="Saddle%20Peak%20%28Andaman%20Islands%29">Saddle Peak</a> at ).

The subsoil of the Andaman islands consists essentially of <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> to <a href="Early%20Eocene">Early Eocene</a> <a href="ophiolite">ophiolite</a>s and <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s (<a href="argillaceous%20limestone">argillaceous</a> and <a href="algal%20limestone">algal limestone</a>s), deformed by numerous deep <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> and <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust</a>s with <a href="ultramafic">ultramafic</a> igneous <a href="intrusion%20%28geology%29">intrusion</a>s. There are at least 11 <a href="mud%20volcano">mud volcano</a>es on the islands.

The climate is typical of tropical islands of similar latitude. It is always warm, but with sea-breezes. Rainfall is irregular, usually dry during the north-east, and very wet during the south-west, monsoons.

The Middle Andamans harbour mostly moist <a href="deciduous%20forests">deciduous forests</a>. North Andamans is characterised by the wet evergreen type, with plenty of woody climbers.

The natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest, with <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s on the coast. The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma. Most of the forests are evergreen, but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman, <a href="Middle%20Andaman%20Island">Middle Andaman</a>, <a href="Baratang">Baratang</a> and parts of <a href="South%20Andaman%20Island">South Andaman Island</a>. The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of <a href="epiphytic">epiphytic</a> vegetation, mostly ferns and orchids.

The Andaman forests are largely unspoiled, despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland. There are protected areas on <a href="Little%20Andaman%20Island">Little Andaman</a>, <a href="Narcondam%20Island">Narcondam</a>, North Andaman and South Andaman, but these are mainly aimed at preserving the coast and the marine wildlife rather than the rainforests. Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats, dogs, cats and the elephants of <a href="Interview%20Island">Interview Island</a> and North Andaman.

Andaman forests contain 200 or more timber producing species of trees, out of which about 30 varieties are considered to be commercial. Major commercial timber species are Gurjan ("<a href="Dipterocarpus">Dipterocarpus</a>" spp.) and <a href="Padauk">Padauk</a> ("<a href="Pterocarpus%20dalbergioides">Pterocarpus dalbergioides</a>"). The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation:


Padauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making.

There are <a href="burr%20wood">burr wood</a> and <a href="buttress%20root">buttress root</a> formations in Andaman Padauk. The largest piece of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of . The largest piece of burr wood was again a dining table for eight.

The holy <a href="Rudraksha">Rudraksha</a> ("Elaeocarps sphaericus") and aromatic Dhoop resin trees also are found here.

The Andaman Islands are home to a number of animals, many of them endemic.

The island's endemic mammals include

The <a href="banded%20pig">banded pig</a> ("Sus scrofa vittatus"), also known as the Andaman wild boar and once thought to be an endemic subspecies, is protected by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). The <a href="spotted%20deer">spotted deer</a> ("Axis axis"), the <a href="Indian%20muntjac">Indian muntjac</a> ("Muntiacus muntjak") and the <a href="sambar%20deer">sambar</a> ("Rusa unicolor") were all introduced to the Andaman islands, though the sambar did not survive.

<a href="Interview%20Island">Interview Island</a> (the largest wildlife sanctuary in the territory) in Middle Andaman holds a population of feral <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s, which were brought in for forest work by a timber company and released when the company went bankrupt. This population has been subject to research studies.

Endemic or near endemic birds include
The islands' many <a href="cave">cave</a>s, such as those at <a href="Chalis%20Ek%20Caves">Chalis Ek</a> are nesting grounds for the edible-nest <a href="swiftlet">swiftlet</a>, whose nests are prized in China for <a href="bird%27s%20nest%20soup">bird's nest soup</a>.

The islands also have a number of endemic <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, <a href="toad">toad</a>s and <a href="frog">frog</a>s, such as the South Andaman krait ("<a href="Bungarus%20andamanensis">Bungarus andamanensis</a>") and Andaman water monitor ("<a href="Varanus%20salvator%20andamanensis">Varanus salvator andamanensis</a>").

There is a sanctuary from <a href="Havelock%20Island">Havelock Island</a> for <a href="saltwater%20crocodile">saltwater crocodile</a>s. Over the past 25 years there have been 24 crocodile attacks with four fatalities, including the death of American tourist Lauren Failla. The government has been criticised for failing to inform tourists of the crocodile sanctuary and danger, while simultaneously promoting tourism. Crocodiles are not only found within the sanctuary, but throughout the island chain in varying densities. They are habitat restricted, so the population is stable but not large. Populations occur throughout available mangrove habitat on all major islands, including a few creeks on Havelock. The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries, thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean. It is best to avoid swimming near mangrove areas or the mouths of creeks; swimming in the open ocean should be safe, but it is best to have a spotter around.

Most of the tribal people in Andaman and Nicobar Islands believe in a religion that can be described as a form of <a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a> <a href="Animism">Animism</a>. The tribal people of these islands believe that Paluga is the only deity and is responsible for everything happening on Earth.
The faith of the Andamanese teaches that Paluga resides on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' <a href="Saddle%20Peak%20%28Andaman%20Islands%29">Saddle Peak (Andaman Islands)</a>. People try to avoid any action that might displease Paluga. People belonging to this religion believe in the presence of souls, ghosts, and spirits.
Interestingly, people of this religion put a lot of emphasis on dreams. They let dreams decide different courses of action in their lives.

Other religions practiced in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are, in order of size, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> and Baha'i Faith. []

, the population of the Andaman was 343,125, having grown from 50,000 in 1960. The bulk of the population originates from immigrants who came to the island since the colonial times, mainly of <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengali</a>, <a href="Hindustani%20people">Hindustani</a> and <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil</a> backgrounds.

Of the people who live in the Andaman Islands, a small minority of about 1,000 are the so-called <a href="Andamanese%20people">Andamanese</a>, the <a href="indigenous%20peoples">aboriginal inhabitants</a> (<a href="adivasi">adivasi</a>) of the islands. By the 1850s when they first came into sustained contact by outside groups, there were estimated 7,000 Andamanese, divided into the following major groups:

As the numbers of settlers from the mainland increased (at first mostly prisoners and involuntary <a href="indentured%20labour">indentured labour</a>ers, later purposely recruited farmers), these indigenous people lost territory and numbers in the face of punitive expeditions by British troops, land encroachment and various epidemic diseases. Presently, there remain only approximately 400–450 indigenous Andamanese. The Jangil were soon extinct. The Great Andamanese were originally 10 distinct tribes with 5,000 people in total; most of the tribes are extinct, and the survivors, now just 52, speak mostly <a href="Hindi%20language">Hindi</a>. The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people. Only the Jarawa and Sentinelese still maintain a steadfast independence and refuse most attempts at contact; their numbers are uncertain but estimated to be in the low hundreds.
<a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a> is the chief community on the islands, and the administrative centre of the Union Territory. The Andaman Islands form a single administrative district within the Union Territory, the <a href="Andaman%20district">Andaman district</a> (the Nicobar Islands were separated and established as the new <a href="Nicobar%20district">Nicobar district</a> in 1974).

The islands are prominently featured in <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> mystery, "<a href="The%20Sign%20of%20the%20Four">The Sign of the Four</a>," as well as in <a href="M.%20M.%20Kaye">M. M. Kaye</a>'s "Death in the Andamans". The magistrate in <a href="Lady%20Gregory">Lady Gregory</a>'s play "<a href="Spreading%20the%20News">Spreading the News</a>" had formerly served in the islands. <a href="Marianne%20Wiggins">Marianne Wiggins</a>' novel, John Dollar (1989), is set on one of the islands; the characters begin an expedition from Burma to celebrate King George's birthday and after an earthquake and tsunami it becomes a grim survival story. A principal character in the book "<a href="Six%20Suspects%20%28novel%29">Six Suspects</a>" by <a href="Vikas%20Swarup">Vikas Swarup</a> is from the Andaman Islands. "<a href="Kaalapani%20%281996%20film%29">Kaalapani</a>" (Malayalam) and "<a href="Sirai%20Chaalai">Sirai Chaalai</a>" (Tamil), a 1996 Indian film by <a href="Priyadarshan">Priyadarshan</a>, depicts the Indian freedom struggle and the lives of prisoners in the <a href="Cellular%20Jail">Cellular Jail</a> in Port Blair. "Island's End" is a 2011 novel by <a href="Padma%20Venkatraman">Padma Venkatraman</a> about the training of an indigenous shaman.

The only commercial airport in the islands is <a href="Veer%20Savarkar%20International%20Airport">Veer Savarkar International Airport</a> in <a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a>, which has scheduled services to <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="Visakhapatnam">Visakhapatnam</a> and <a href="Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a>. The airport is under the control of the <a href="Indian%20Navy">Indian Navy</a>. Previously, only daylight operations were allowed, but since the beginning of 2016 night flights have also operated. A small airstrip of approximately 1000 metres is located near the Eastern shore of North Andaman near <a href="Diglipur">Diglipur</a>.

Due to the length of the routes and the small number of airlines flying to the islands, fares have traditionally been relatively expensive, although cheaper for locals than visitors. Fares are high during the peak seasons of spring and winter, although fares have decreased over time due to the expansion of the civil aviation industry in India.

Alexander Anderson (, <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> – , <a href="Paris">Paris</a>) was a <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>.

He was born in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, possibly in 1582, according to a print which suggests he was aged 35 in 1617. It is unknown where he was educated, but it is likely that he initially studied writing and philosophy (the "belles lettres") in his home city of Aberdeen.

He then went to the <a href="Mainland%20Europe">continent</a>, and was a professor of mathematics in Paris by the start of the seventeenth century. There he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various <a href="geometric">geometric</a> and <a href="algebra">algebra</a>ic tracts. He described himself as having "more wisdom than riches" in the dedication of "Vindiciae Archimedis" (1616).

He was first cousin of David Anderson of Finshaugh, a celebrated mathematician, and David Anderson's daughter was the mother of mathematician <a href="James%20Gregory%20%28mathematician%29">James Gregory</a>.

He was selected by the executors of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a> to revise and edit Viète's manuscript works. Viète died in 1603, and it is unclear if Anderson knew him, but his eminence was sufficient to attract the attention of the dead man's executors. Anderson corrected and expanded upon Viète's manuscripts, which extended known geometry to the <a href="new%20algebra">new algebra</a>, which used general symbols to represent quantities.

The known works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, and as the last of them was published in 1619, it is probable that the author died soon after that year, but the precise date is unknown. He wrote other works that have since been lost. From his last work it appears he wrote another piece, "A Treatise on the Mensuration of Solids," and copies of two other works, "Ex. Math." and "Stereometria Triangulorum Sphæricorum", were in the possession of Sir Alexander Hume until the after the middle of the seventeenth century.

Andocides

Andocides (; , "Andokides"; c. 440 – c. 390 BC) was a <a href="logographer%20%28legal%29">logographer</a> (speech writer) in Ancient Greece. He was one of the ten <a href="Attic%20orators">Attic orators</a> included in the "Alexandrian Canon" compiled by <a href="Aristophanes%20of%20Byzantium">Aristophanes of Byzantium</a> and <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samothrace">Aristarchus of Samothrace</a> in the third century BC.

Andocides was the son of Leogoras, and was born in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> around 440 BC. He belonged to the ancient <a href="Eupatrid">Eupatrid</a> family of the <a href="Kerykes">Kerykes</a>, who traced their lineage up to <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and the god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>.

In his youth, he seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Molossia">Molossia</a>, <a href="Thesprotia">Thesprotia</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. And although he was frequently attacked for his political opinions, he maintained his ground until, in 415 BC, when he became involved in the charge brought against <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the <a href="Herma">Herms</a> on the eve of the departure of the <a href="Sicilian%20expedition">Athenian expedition</a> against <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. It appeared particularly likely that Andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes, which was believed to be a preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution, since the Herm standing close to his house in the <a href="phyle">phyle</a> Aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured.

Andocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison, but after some time recovered his freedom by a promise that he would turn informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime; and on the suggestion of one Charmides or Timaeus, he mentioned four, all of whom were put to death. He is said to have also denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries, but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger - a charge he strenuously denied. But as Andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge, he was deprived of his rights as a citizen, and left Athens.

He now traveled about in various parts of Greece, and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful people. The means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind; among which a service he rendered to a prince in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> is mentioned in particular.

In 411 BC, Andocides returned to Athens on the establishment of the <a href="oligarchy">oligarchic</a> government of the <a href="The%20Four%20Hundred%20%28oligarchy%29">Four Hundred</a>, hoping that a certain service he had rendered the Athenian ships at Samos would secure him a welcome reception. But no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of Andocides, than their leader <a href="Peisander">Peisander</a> had him seized, and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at Samos. During his trial, Andocides, who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him, leaped to the altar which stood in the court, and there assumed the attitude of a supplicant. This saved his life, but he was imprisoned. Soon afterwards, however, he was set free, or escaped from prison.

Andocides now went to Cyprus, where for a time he enjoyed the friendship of <a href="Evagoras%20I">Evagoras</a>; but, by some circumstance or other, he exasperated his friend, and was consigned to prison. Here again he escaped, and after the restoration of democracy in Athens and the abolition of the Four Hundred, he ventured once more to return to Athens; but as he was still suffering under a sentence of civil disenfranchisement, he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the <a href="prytaneis">prytaneis</a> to allow him to attend the assembly of the people. The latter, however, expelled him from the city. It was on this occasion, 411 BC, that Andocides delivered the speech still extant "On his return", on which he petitioned for permission to reside at Athens, but in vain. In his third exile, Andocides went to reside in <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, and during the time of his absence from his native city, his house there was occupied by <a href="Cleophon%20%28politician%29">Cleophon</a>, the leading <a href="demagogue">demagogue</a>.

Andocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of <a href="Thirty%20Tyrants">the Thirty</a> by <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a>, when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also. He himself says that he returned to Athens from Cyprus, where he claimed to have great influence and considerable property. Because of the general amnesty, he was allowed to remain at Athens, enjoyed peace for the next three years, and soon recovered an influential position. According to <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a>, it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against <a href="Archippus">Archippus</a> or <a href="Aristippus">Aristippus</a>, which, however, he dropped on receiving a sum of money. During this period Andocides became a member of the <a href="Boule%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">boule</a>, in which he appears to have possessed a great influence, as well as in the popular assembly. He was <a href="gymnasiarch">gymnasiarch</a> at the <a href="Hephaestaea">Hephaestaea</a>, was sent as <a href="architheorus">architheorus</a> to the <a href="Isthmian%20Games">Isthmian Games</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>, and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury.

But in 400 BC, <a href="Callias">Callias</a>, supported by <a href="Cephisius">Cephisius</a>, <a href="Agyrrhius">Agyrrhius</a>, <a href="Meletus">Meletus</a>, and <a href="Epichares">Epichares</a>, urged the necessity of preventing Andocides from attending the assembly, as he had never been formally freed from the civil disenfranchisement. Callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at <a href="Eleusis">Eleusis</a>. The orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant "on the Mysteries" (περὶ τῶν μυστηρίων), in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms, that he had not violated the laws of the temple at Eleusis, that anyway he had received his citizenship back as a result of the amnesty, and that Callias was really motivated by a private dispute with Andocides over inheritance. He was acquitted. After this, he again enjoyed peace until 394 BC, he was sent as ambassador to <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> respecting the peace to be concluded in consequence of <a href="Conon">Conon</a>'s victory off <a href="Cnidus">Cnidus</a>. On his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy. The speech "On the peace with the Lacedaemons" (περὶ τῆς πρὸς Λακεδαιμονίους εἰρήνης), which is still extant, refers to this affair. It was delivered in 393 BC (though some scholars place it in 391 BC). Andocides was found guilty, and sent into exile for the fourth time. He never returned afterwards, and seems to have died soon after this blow.

Andocides appears to have fathered no children, since he is described at the age of 70 as being childless, although the <a href="scholiast">scholiast</a> on <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> mentions <a href="Antiphon">Antiphon</a> as a son of Andocides. The large fortune which he had inherited from his father, or acquired in his commercial undertakings, was greatly diminished in the latter years of his life.

As an orator Andocides does not appear to have been held in very high esteem by the ancients, as he is seldom mentioned, though <a href="Valerius%20Theon">Valerius Theon</a> is said to have written a commentary on his orations. We do not hear of his having been trained in any of the sophistical schools of the time, and he had probably developed his talents in the practical school of the popular assembly. Hence his orations have no mannerism in them, and are really, as Plutarch says, simple and free from all rhetorical pomp and ornament.

Sometimes, however, his style is diffuse, and becomes tedious and obscure. The best among his orations is that on the Mysteries; but, for the history of the time, all are of the highest importance.

Besides the three orations already mentioned, which are undoubtedly genuine, there is a fourth against Alcibiades (κατὰ Ἀλκιβιάδου), said to have been delivered by Andocides during the <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a> of 415 BC; but it is probably spurious, though it appears to contain genuine historical matter. Some scholars ascribed it to <a href="Phaeax%20%28orator%29">Phaeax</a>, who took part in the ostracism, according to Plutarch. But it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century BC, since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of Alcibiades was a standing rhetorical theme. Besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orations.

Andrew II of Hungary

Andrew II (, , , ; 117721 September 1235), also known as Andrew of Jerusalem, was <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a> and <a href="King%20of%20Croatia">Croatia</a> between 1205 and 1235. He ruled the <a href="Principality%20of%20Halych">Principality of Halych</a> from 1188 until 1189/1190, and again between 1208/1209 and 1210. He was the younger son of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20III%20of%20Hungary">Béla III of Hungary</a>, who entrusted him with the administration of the newly conquered <a href="Principality%20of%20Halych">Principality of Halych</a> in 1188. Andrew's rule was unpopular, and the <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s expelled him. Béla III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a <a href="crusade">crusade</a> to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>. Instead, Andrew forced his elder brother, King <a href="Emeric%20of%20Hungary">Emeric of Hungary</a>, to cede <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%281102%E2%80%931526%29">Croatia</a> and <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> as an appanage to him in 1197. The following year, Andrew occupied <a href="Zachlumia">Hum</a>.

Despite the fact that Andrew did not stop conspiring against Emeric, the dying king made Andrew guardian of his son, <a href="Ladislaus%20III%20of%20Hungary">Ladislaus III</a>, in 1204. After the premature death of Ladislaus, Andrew ascended the throne in 1205. According to historian László Kontler, "[i]t was amindst the socio-political turmoil during [Andrew's] reign that the relations, arrangements, institutional framework and social categories that arose under Stephen I, started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society" in Hungary. Andrew introduced a new grants policy, the so-called "new institutions", giving away money and royal estates to his partisans despite the loss of royal revenues. He was the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title of "King of Halych and <a href="Prince%20of%20Vladimir-in-Volhynia">Lodomeria</a>". He waged at least a dozen wars to seize the two <a href="Rus%27%20principalities">Rus' principalities</a>, but the local <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s and neighboring princes prevented him from conquering the principalities. He participated in the <a href="Fifth%20Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a> to the Holy Land in 1217–1218, but the crusade was a failure.

When the "<a href="servientes%20regis">servientes regis</a>", or "royal servants", rose up, Andrew was forced to issue the <a href="Golden%20Bull%20of%201222">Golden Bull of 1222</a>, confirming their privileges. This led to the rise of the <a href="nobility%20in%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary</a>. His "<a href="Diploma%20Andreanum">Diploma Andreanum</a>" of 1224 listed the liberties of the <a href="Transylvanian%20Saxon">Transylvanian Saxon</a> community. The employment of <a href="Jews%20in%20Hungary">Jews</a> and <a href="B%C3%B6sz%C3%B6rm%C3%A9ny">Muslims</a> to administer the royal revenues led him into conflict with the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> and the Hungarian <a href="prelate">prelate</a>s. Andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non-Christian officials in 1233, but he never fulfilled the latter promise.

Andrew's first wife, <a href="Gertrude%20of%20Merania">Gertrude of Merania</a>, was murdered in 1213, because her blatant favoritism towards her German kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords. The veneration of their daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Hungary">Elizabeth of Hungary</a>, was confirmed by the Holy See during Andrew's lifetime. After Andrew's death, his sons, <a href="B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary">Béla</a> and <a href="Coloman%20of%20Galicia-Lodomeria">Coloman</a>, accused his third wife, <a href="Beatrice%20d%27Este%2C%20Queen%20of%20Hungary">Beatrice d'Este</a>, of adultery and never considered her son, <a href="Stephen%20the%20Posthumous">Stephen</a>, to be a legitimate son of Andrew.

Andrew was the second son of King <a href="B%C3%A9la%20III%20of%20Hungary">Béla III</a> and Béla's first wife, <a href="Agnes%20of%20Antioch">Agnes of Antioch</a>. The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177. Andrew was first mentioned in connection to his father's invasion of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Halych">Principality of Halych</a> in 1188. That year, Béla III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, <a href="Vladimir%20II%20Yaroslavich">Vladimir II Yaroslavich</a>, who had been expelled by his subjects. Béla forced the new prince, <a href="Roman%20Mstislavich">Roman Mstislavich</a>, to flee. After conquering Halych, he granted it to Andrew. Béla also captured Vladimir Yaroslavich and imprisoned him in Hungary.

After Béla's withdrawal from Halych, Roman Mstislavich returned with the assistance of <a href="Rurik%20Rostislavich">Rurik Rostislavich</a>, Prince of <a href="Belgorod%20Kievsky">Belgorod Kievsky</a>. They tried to expel Andrew and his Hungarian retinue, but the Hungarians routed the united forces of Mstislavich and Rostislavich. A group of local <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s offered the throne to Rostislav Ivanovich, a distant cousin of the imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich. Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling Andrew's troops to repel the attacks. Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> churches. Consequently, the local boyars allied with their former prince, Vladimir Yaroslavich, who had escaped from captivity and returned to Halych. Duke <a href="Casimir%20II%20the%20Just">Casimir II of Poland</a> also supported Vladimir Yaroslavich, and they expelled Andrew and his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190. Andrew returned to Hungary after his defeat. He did not receive a separate duchy from his father, who only gave him estates and money. On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a <a href="crusade">crusade</a> to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>, ordered Andrew to fulfill his vow. Andrew's father died on 23 April 1196, and Andrew's older brother, <a href="Emeric%2C%20King%20of%20Hungary">Emeric</a>, succeeded him.

Andrew used the funds that he inherited from his father to recruit supporters among the Hungarian lords. He also formed an alliance with <a href="Leopold%20VI%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold VI, Duke of Austria</a>, and they plotted against Emeric. Their united troops routed the royal army at <a href="Ma%C4%8Dki">Mački</a>, Slavonia, in December 1197. Under duress, King Emeric gave <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Croatia%20%281102%E2%80%931526%29">Croatia</a> and <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> to Andrew as an appanage. In practice, Andrew administered Croatia and Dalmatia as an independent monarch. He minted coins, granted land and confirmed privileges. He cooperated with the <a href="House%20of%20Frankopan">Frankopans</a>, <a href="House%20of%20Baboni%C4%87">Babonići</a>, and other local lords. The <a href="Canons%20Regular%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre</a> settled in the province during his rule. Taking advantage of <a href="Miroslav%20of%20Hum">Miroslav of Hum</a>'s death, Andrew invaded <a href="Zachlumia">Hum</a> and occupied at least the land between the <a href="Cetina">Cetina</a> and <a href="Neretva">Neretva</a> rivers. He styled himself, "By the grace of God, Duke of Zadar and of all Dalmatia, Croatia and Hum" in his charters.

<a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a> urged Andrew to lead a crusade the Holy Land, but Andrew hatched a new conspiracy against Emeric with the help of John, Abbot of Pannonhalma, <a href="Boleslaus%2C%20Bishop%20of%20V%C3%A1c">Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác</a>, and many other prelates and lords. The Pope threatened him with <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> if he failed to fulfill his father's vow, but Andrew did not yield. The conspiracy was uncovered on 10 March 1199, when King Emeric seized letters written by Andrew's partisans to Bishop Boleslaus. That summer, royal troops routed Andrew's army near <a href="Lake%20Balaton">Lake Balaton</a>, and Andrew fled to Austria. A papal legate mediated a reconciliation between Andrew and Emeric, who allowed Andrew to return to Croatia and Dalmatia in 1200. Andrew married <a href="Gertrude%20of%20Merania">Gertrude of Merania</a>; her father, <a href="Berthold%2C%20Duke%20of%20Merania">Berthold, Duke of Merania</a>, owned extensive domains in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> along the borders of Andrew's duchy.

When Emeric's son, <a href="Ladislaus%20III%20of%20Hungary">Ladislaus</a>, was born around 1200, Andrew's hopes to succeed his brother as king were shattered. Pope Innocent confirmed the child's position as heir to the crown, declaring that Andrew's future sons would only inherit Andrew's duchy. Andrew planned a new rebellion against his brother, but King Emeric captured him without resistance near <a href="Vara%C5%BEdin">Varaždin</a> in October 1203.

Andrew was first imprisoned in the fort of <a href="Gornji%20Kneginec">Gornji Kneginec</a>, then in <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a>. Alexander of the <a href="Hont-P%C3%A1zm%C3%A1ny">Hont-Pázmány</a> clan freed him in early 1204. Having fallen ill, King Emeric had his son, Ladislaus, crowned king on 26 August. Andrew reconciled with his dying brother, who entrusted him with "the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majority", according to the nearly contemporaneous <a href="Thomas%20the%20Archdeacon">Thomas the Archdeacon</a>.

King Emeric died on 30 November 1204. Andrew governed the kingdom as Ladislaus's regent, but he counted his regnal years from the time of his brother's death, showing that he already regarded himself as the lawful monarch during Ladislaus III's reign. Pope Innocent told Andrew that he should remain loyal to Ladislaus. Instead, Andrew seized the money that Emeric had deposited for Ladislaus in <a href="Pilis%20Abbey">Pilis Abbey</a>. Ladislaus's mother, <a href="Constance%20of%20Aragon">Constance of Aragon</a>, fled from Hungary, taking her son to <a href="Duchy%20of%20Austria">Austria</a>. Andrew prepared to war against <a href="Leopold%20VI%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Leopold VI, Duke of Austria</a>, but Ladislaus suddenly died in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> on 7 May 1205.

<a href="John%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Esztergom">John, Archbishop of Kalocsa</a>, crowned Andrew king in <a href="Sz%C3%A9kesfeh%C3%A9rv%C3%A1r">Székesfehérvár</a> on 29 May 1205. Andrew introduced a new policy for royal grants, which he called "new institutions" in one of his charters. He distributed large portions of the royal domainroyal castles and all estates attached to themas inheritable grants to his supporters, declaring that "the best measure of a royal grant is its being immeasurable." His "new institutions" altered the relations between the monarchs and the Hungarian lords. During the previous two centuries, a lord's status primarily depended on the income he received for his services to the monarch; after the introduction of the "new institutions", their inheritable estates yielded sufficient revenues. This policy also diminished the funds upon which the authority of the "<a href="isp%C3%A1n">ispán</a>s", or heads, of the <a href="County%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%29">counties</a>who were appointed by the monarchshad been based.

During his reign, Andrew was intensely interested in the internal affairs of his former principality of Halych. He launched his first campaign to recapture Halych in 1205 or 1206. Upon the boyars' request, he intervened against <a href="Vsevolod%20Svyatoslavich">Vsevolod Svyatoslavich</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Chernigov">Prince of Chernigov</a>, and his allies on behalf of <a href="Daniel%20of%20Galicia">Daniel Romanovich</a>, the child-prince of Halych, and <a href="Prince%20of%20Vladimir-in-Volhynia">Lodomeria</a>. Svyatoslavich and his allies were forced to withdraw. Andrew adopted the title of "King of Galicia and Lodomeria", demonstrating his claim to suzerainty in the two principalities. 
After Andrew returned to Hungary, Vsevolod Svyatoslavich's distant cousin, <a href="Vladimir%20III%20Igorevich">Vladimir Igorevich</a>, seized both Halych and Lodomeria, expelling Daniel Romanovich and his mother. They fled to <a href="Leszek%20I%20of%20Poland">Leszek I of Poland</a>, who suggested that they visit Andrew. However, Vladimir Igorevich "sent many gifts" to both Andrew and Leszek, dissuading "them from attacking him" on behalf of Romanovich, according to the "<a href="Galician%E2%80%93Volhynian%20Chronicle">Galician–Volhynian Chronicle</a>". Vladimir Igorevich's rebellious brother, <a href="Roman%20II%20Igorevich">Roman Igorevich</a>, soon came to Hungary, seeking Andrew's assistance. Roman returned to Halych and expelled Vladimir Igorevich with the help of Hungarian auxiliary troops.

Andrew confirmed the liberties of two Dalmatian towns<a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a> and <a href="Omi%C5%A1">Omiš</a>and issued a new charter listing the privileges of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Split-Makarska">archbishops of Split</a> in 1207. Taking advantage of a conflict between Roman Igorevich and his boyars, Andrew sent troops to Halych under the command of <a href="Benedict%2C%20son%20of%20Korl%C3%A1t">Benedict, son of Korlát</a>. Benedict captured Roman Igorevich and occupied the principality in 1208 or 1209. Instead of appointing a new prince, Andrew made Benedict governor of Halych. Benedict "tortured boyars and was addicted to lechery", according to the "Galician–Volhynian Chronicle". The boyars offered the throne to <a href="Mstislav%20Mstislavich">Mstislav Mstislavich</a>, <a href="Prince%20of%20Zvenigorod">Prince of Zvenigorod</a>, if he could overthrow Benedict. Mstislav Mstislavich invaded Halych, but he could not defeat Benedict.

Queen Gertrude's two brothers, Ekbert, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bamberg">Bishop of Bamberg</a>, and Henry II, Margrave of Istria, fled to Hungary in 1208 after they were accused of participating in the murder of <a href="Philip%20of%20Swabia">Philip</a>, <a href="King%20of%20the%20Germans">King of the Germans</a>. Andrew granted large domains to Bishop Ekbert in the <a href="Szepess%C3%A9g">Szepesség</a> region (now <a href="Spi%C5%A1">Spiš</a>, Slovakia). Gertrude's youngest brother, <a href="Berthold%20%28patriarch%20of%20Aquileia%29">Berthold</a>, had been <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Kalocsa">Archbishop of Kalocsa</a> since 1206; he was made <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a> and <a href="Ban%20of%20Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> in 1209. Andrew's generosity towards his wife's German relatives and courtiers discontented the local lords. According to historian Gyula Kristó, the <a href="Anonymus%20%28chronicler%29">anonymous author</a> of "<a href="Gesta%20Hungarorum">The Deeds of the Hungarians</a>" referred to the Germans from the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> when he sarcastically mentioned that " the Romans gaze on the goods of Hungary." In 1209, <a href="Zadar">Zadar</a>, which <a href="Siege%20of%20Zadar">had been lost to the Venetians</a>, was liberated by one of Andrew's Dalmatian vassals, <a href="Domald%20of%20Sidraga">Domald of Sidraga</a>, but the Venetians recaptured the town a year later.

Roman Igorevich reconciled with his brother, Vladimir Igorevich, in early 1209 or 1210. Their united forces vanquished Benedict's army, expelling the Hungarians from Halych. Vladimir Igorevich sent one of his sons, Vsevolod Vladimirovich, "bearing gifts to the king in Hungary" to appease Andrew, according to the "Galician–Volhynian Chronicle". A group of discontented Hungarian lords offered the crown to Andrew's cousins, the sons of Andrew's uncle, <a href="G%C3%A9za%2C%20son%20of%20G%C3%A9za%20II%20of%20Hungary">Géza</a>; they lived in "Greek land". However, the cousins' envoys were captured in Split in 1210. In the early 1210s, Andrew sent "an army of <a href="Transylvanian%20Saxons">Saxons</a>, <a href="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>, <a href="Sz%C3%A9kelys">Székelys</a> and <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a>" commanded by Joachim, <a href="Count%20of%20Hermannstadt">Count of Hermannstadt</a>, (now <a href="Sibiu">Sibiu</a>, Romania) to assist <a href="Boril%20of%20Bulgaria">Boril of Bulgaria</a>'s fight against three rebellious <a href="Cumans">Cuman</a> chieftains. Around the same time, Hungarian troops occupied Belgrade and <a href="Brani%C4%8Devo%20%28Golubac%29">Barancs</a> (now Braničevo, Serbia), which had been lost to Bulgaria under Emeric. Andrew's army defeated the Cumans at <a href="Vidin">Vidin</a>. Andrew granted the <a href="Barcas%C3%A1g">Barcaság</a> (now <a href="%C8%9Aara%20B%C3%A2rsei">Țara Bârsei</a>, Romania) to the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>. The Knights were to defend the easternmost regions of the Kingdom of Hungary against the Cumans and encourage their conversion to Catholicism.

A group of boyars, who were alarmed by the despotic acts of Vladimir Igorevich, asked Andrew to restore Daniel Romanovich as ruler of Halych in 1210 or 1211. Andrew and his alliesLeszek I of Poland and at least five Rus' princessent their armies to Halych and restored Daniel Romanovich. Local boyars expelled Daniel Romanovich's mother in 1212. She persuaded Andrew to personally lead his army to Halych. He captured Volodislav Kormilchich, the most influential boyar, and took him to Hungary. After Andrew withdrew from Halych, the boyars again offered the throne to Mstislav Mstislavich, who expelled Daniel Romanovich and his mother from the principality. Andrew departed for a new campaign against Halych in summer 1213. During his absence, Hungarian lords who were aggrieved at Queen Gertrude's favoritism towards her German entourage captured and murdered her and many of her courtiers in the <a href="Pilis%20Hills">Pilis Hills</a> on 28 September. When he heard of her murder, Andrew returned to Hungary and ordered the execution of the murderer, <a href="Peter%2C%20son%20of%20T%C3%B6re">Peter, son of Töre</a>. However, Peter's accomplices, including <a href="Palatine%20of%20Hungary">Palatine</a> <a href="B%C3%A1nk%20B%C3%A1r-Kal%C3%A1n">Bánk Bár-Kalán</a>, did not receive severe punishments. A group of Hungarian lords, whom Andrew called "perverts" in one of his letters, was plotting to dethrone Andrew and crown his eldest son, the eight-year-old <a href="B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary">Béla</a>, but they failed to dethrone him and could only force Andrew to consent to Béla's coronation in 1214.

Andrew and Leszek of Poland signed a treaty of alliance, which obliged Andrew's second son, <a href="Coloman%20of%20Galicia-Lodomeria">Coloman</a>, to marry Leszek of Poland's daughter, <a href="Salomea%20of%20Poland">Salomea</a>. Andrew and Leszek jointly invaded Halych in 1214, and Coloman was made prince. He agreed to cede <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl</a> to Leszek of Poland. The following year, Andrew returned to Halych and captured <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl</a>. Leszek of Poland soon reconciled with Mstislav Mstislavich; they jointly invaded Halych and forced Coloman to flee to Hungary. A new officer of state, the <a href="master%20of%20the%20treasury">treasurer</a>, was responsible for the administration of the royal chamber from around 1214 onwards. However, royal revenues had significantly diminished. Upon the advice of the treasurer, <a href="Denis%2C%20son%20of%20Ampud">Denis, son of Ampud</a>, Andrew imposed new taxes and <a href="Farm%20%28revenue%20leasing%29">farmed out royal income</a> from minting, salt trade and custom duties. The yearly exchange of coins also produced more revenue for the royal chamber. However, these measures provoked discontent in Hungary.

Andrew signed a new treaty of alliance with Leszek of Poland in the summer of 1216. Leszek and Andrew's son, Coloman, invaded Halych and expelled Mstislav Mstislavich and Daniel Romanovich, after which Coloman was restored. That same year, Andrew met <a href="Stephen%20Nemanji%C4%87">Stephen Nemanjić</a>, <a href="Grand%20Prince%20of%20Serbia">Grand Prince of Serbia</a>, in <a href="%C4%86uprija">Ravno</a> (now <a href="%C4%86uprija">Ćuprija</a>, Serbia). He persuaded Stephen Nemanjić to negotiate with <a href="Henry%20of%20Flanders">Henry</a>, <a href="Latin%20Emperor">Latin Emperor of Constantinople</a>, who was the uncle of Andrew's second wife, <a href="Yolanda%20de%20Courtenay">Yolanda de Courtenay</a>. Stephen Nemanjić was crowned king of Serbia in 1217. Andrew planned to invade Serbia, but Stephen Nemanjić's brother, <a href="Saint%20Sava">Sava</a>, dissuaded him, according to both versions of the "Life of Sava".

In July 1216, the newly elected <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a> once again called upon Andrew to fulfill his father's vow to lead a crusade. Andrew, who had postponed the crusade at least three times (in 1201, 1209 and 1213), finally agreed. <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a>, Tibor Almási and other modern historians say that Andrew hoped that his decision would increase his likelihood of being elected as Latin Emperor of Constantinople, because his wife's uncle, Emperor Henry, had died in June. According to a letter written by Pope Honorius in 1217, envoys from the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a> had actually informed Andrew that they planned to elect either him or his father-in-law, <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Courtenay">Peter of Courtenay</a>, as emperor. The barons of the Latin Empire elected Peter of Courtenay in the summer of 1216.

Andrew sold and mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign, which became part of the wider <a href="Fifth%20Crusade">Fifth Crusade</a>. He renounced his claim to Zadar in favor of the Republic of Venice so that he could secure shipping for his army. He entrusted Hungary to Archbishop John of Esztergom, and gave Croatia and Dalmatia to <a href="Pontius%20de%20Cruce">Pontius de Cruce</a>, the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Templar</a> Prior of Vrana. In July 1217, Andrew departed from <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, accompanied by <a href="Leopold%20VI%20of%20Austria">Leopold VI of Austria</a> and <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Merania">Otto I, Duke of Merania</a>. His army was so largeat least 10,000 mounted soldiers and uncountable infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later. The ships transported them to <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a>, where they landed in October.

The leaders of the crusade included <a href="John%20of%20Brienne">John of Brienne</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem">King of Jerusalem</a>, Leopold of Austria, the <a href="Grand%20Master%20of%20the%20Knights%20Hospitaller">Grand Masters of the Hospitallers</a>, the <a href="Grand%20Masters%20of%20the%20Knights%20Templar">Templars</a> and the <a href="Grand%20Masters%20of%20the%20Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>. They held a war council in Acre, with Andrew leading the meeting. In early November, the crusaders launched a campaign for the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, forcing <a href="Al-Adil%20I">Al-Adil I</a>, <a href="Sultan%20of%20Egypt">Sultan of Egypt</a>, to withdraw without fighting; the crusaders then pillaged <a href="Beisan">Beisan</a>. After the crusaders returned to Acre, Andrew did not participate in any other military actions. Instead, he was collecting <a href="relic">relic</a>s, including a water jug allegedly used at the <a href="marriage%20at%20Cana">marriage at Cana</a>, the heads of <a href="Saint%20Stephen">Saint Stephen</a> and <a href="Margaret%20the%20Virgin">Margaret the Virgin</a>, the right hands of the Apostles <a href="Thomas%20the%20Apostle">Thomas</a> and <a href="Bartholomew%20the%20Apostle">Bartholomew</a> and a part of <a href="Aaron%27s%20rod">Aaron's rod</a>. If Thomas the Archdeacon's report of certain "evil and audacious men" in Acre who "treacherously passed him a poisoned drink" is reliable, Andrew's inactivity was because of illness.

Andrew decided to return home at the very beginning of 1218, even though <a href="Raoul%20of%20Merencourt">Raoul of Merencourt</a>, <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, threatened him with excommunication. Andrew first visited <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a> and participated in the marriage of <a href="Bohemond%20IV%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond IV of Antioch</a> and <a href="Melisende%20of%20Lusignan">Melisende of Lusignan</a> on 10 January. From Tripoli, he travelled to <a href="Armenian%20Kingdom%20of%20Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, where he and <a href="Leo%20I%2C%20King%20of%20Armenia">Leo I of Armenia</a> betrothed Andrew's youngest son, <a href="Andrew%20of%20Hungary%2C%20Prince%20of%20Halych">Andrew</a>, and Leo's daughter, <a href="Isabella%2C%20Queen%20of%20Armenia">Isabella</a>. Andrew proceeded through the <a href="Seldjuk">Seldjuk</a> <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Sultanate of Rum</a> before arriving in <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a> (now <a href="%C4%B0znik">İznik</a>, Turkey). His cousins (the sons of his uncle, Géza) attacked him when he was in Nicaea. He arranged the marriage of his oldest son, Béla, to <a href="Maria%20Laskarina">Maria Laskarina</a>, a daughter of Emperor <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore I Laskaris</a>. When he arrived in Bulgaria, Andrew was detained until he "gave full surety that his daughter would be united in marriage" to <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20II%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria</a>, according to Thomas the Archdeacon. Andrew returned to Hungary in late 1218. Andrew's "crusade had achieved nothing and brought him no honor", according to historian Thomas C. Van Cleve. Oliver of Padernborn, <a href="James%20of%20Vitry">James of Vitry</a> and other 13th-century authors blamed Andrew for the failure of crusade.

When he returned to Hungary, Andrew complained to Pope Honorius that his kingdom was "in a miserable and destroyed state, deprived of all of its revenues." A group of barons had even expelled Archbishop John from Hungary. Andrew was in massive debt because of his crusade, which forced him to impose extraordinarily high taxes and debase coinage. In 1218 or 1219, Mstislav Mstislavich invaded Halych and captured Andrew's son, Coloman. Andrew compromised with Mstislavich. Coloman was released, and Andrew's youngest son and namesake was betrothed to Mstislavich's daughter. In 1220, a group of lords persuaded Andrew to make his eldest son, Béla, the Duke of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia.

Andrew employed <a href="Jews%20in%20Hungary">Jews</a> and <a href="B%C3%B6sz%C3%B6rm%C3%A9ny">Muslims</a> to administer royal revenues, which caused a discord between Andrew and the Holy See starting in the early 1220s. Pope Honorius urged Andrew and Queen Yolanda to prohibit Muslims from employing Christians. Andrew confirmed the privileges of clergymen, including their exemption from taxes and <a href="Privilegium%20fori">their right to be exclusively judged by church courts</a>, but also prohibited the <a href="consecration">consecration</a> of "<a href="udvornici">udvornici</a>", <a href="castle%20folk%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%29">castle folk</a> and other serfs in early 1222. However, a new conflict emerged between Andrew and the Holy See after he persuaded Béla to separate from his wife, Maria Laskarina. An "immense crowd" approached Andrew around June 1222, demanding "grave and unjust things", according to a letter of Pope Honorius. Actually, the <a href="Royal%20servant%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%29">royal servants</a>who were landowners directly subject to the monarch's power and obliged to fight in the royal armyassembled, forcing Andrew to dismiss <a href="Julius%20I%20K%C3%A1n">Julius Kán</a> and his other officials. Andrew was also forced issue a royal charter, the <a href="Golden%20Bull%20of%201222">Golden Bull of 1222</a>. The charter summarized the liberties of the royal servants, including their exemption from taxes and the jurisdiction of the "<a href="isp%C3%A1n">ispán</a>s". The last clause of the Golden Bull authorized "the bishops as well as the other barons and nobles of the realm, singularly and in common" to resist the monarch if he did not honor the provisions of the charter. The Golden Bull clearly distinguished the royal servants from the king's other subjects, which led to the rise of the <a href="Hungarian%20nobility">Hungarian nobility</a>. The Golden Bull is commonly compared with England's "<a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>" — a similar charter which was sealed a few years earlier in 1215. A significant difference between them is that, in England, the settlement strengthened the position of all the royal subjects but, in Hungary, the aristocracy came to dominate both the crown and the lower orders.

Andrew discharged Palatine <a href="Theodore%20Csan%C3%A1d">Theodore Csanád</a> and restored Julius Kán in the second half of 1222. The following year, Pope Honorius urged Andrew to launch a new crusade. If the report of the "Continuatio Claustroneuburgensis" is reliable, Andrew took the cross to show that he intended launch a new crusade, but no other sources mention this event. Andrew planned to arrange a new marriage for his eldest son, Béla, but Pope Honorius mediated a reconciliation between Béla and his wife in the autumn of 1223. This angered Andrew, and Béla fled to Austria. He returned in 1224, after the bishops persuaded Andrew to forgive him.

In his "<a href="Diploma%20Andreanum">Diploma Andreanum</a>" of 1224, Andrew confirmed the privileges of the "<a href="Transylvanian%20Saxons">Saxons</a>" who inhabited the region of <a href="Hermannstadt">Hermannstadt</a> in southern Transylvania (now <a href="Sibiu">Sibiu</a>, Romania). The following year, he launched a campaign against the Teutonic Knights, who had attempted to eliminate his suzerainty. The Knights were forced to leave <a href="Barcas%C3%A1g">Barcaság</a> and the neighboring lands. Andrew's envoys and Leopold VI of Austria signed a treaty on 6 June, which ended the armed conflicts along the Hungarian-Austrian border. As part of the treaty, Leopold VI paid an indemnification for the damages that his troops had caused in Hungary. Andrew made his oldest son, Béla, <a href="Duke%20of%20Transylvania">Duke of Transylvania</a>. Béla's former duchy was given to Andrew's second son, Coloman, in 1226. Duke Béla started expanding his suzerainty over the <a href="Cumans">Cumans</a>, who inhabited the lands east of the Carpathian Mountains. Andrew launched a campaign against Mstislav Mstislavich in 1226, because the latter refused to grant Halych to Andrew's youngest son despite a previous compromise. Andrew besieged and captured <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl</a>, <a href="Terebovl">Terebovl</a>, and other fortresses in Halych. However, his troops were routed at <a href="Kremenets">Kremenets</a> and Zvenigorod, forcing him to withdraw. Despite his victories, Mstislavich ceded Halych to Andrew's son in early 1227.

In 1228, Andrew authorized his son, Béla, to revise his previous land grants. Pope Honorius also supported Béla's efforts. Béla confiscated the domains of two noblemen, <a href="Simon%20Kacsics">Simon Kacsics</a> and Bánk Bár-Kalán, who had taken part in the conspiracy to murder Queen Gertrude. In 1229, upon Béla's proposal, Andrew confirmed the privileges of the Cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to Béla. <a href="Robert%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Esztergom">Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom</a>, made a complaint about Andrew to the Holy See, because Andrew continued to employ Jews and Muslims. <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20IX">Pope Gregory IX</a> authorized the archbishop to perform acts of religious censure to persuade Andrew to dismiss his non-Christian officials. Under duress, Andrew issued a new Golden Bull in 1231, which confirmed that Muslims were banned from employment, and empowered the Archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate the king if he failed to honor the provisions of the new Golden Bull. In the second half of the year, Andrew invaded Halych and restored his youngest son, Andrew, to the throne.

Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary under an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> on 25 February 1232, because the employment of Jews and Muslims continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231. Since the archbishop accused the Muslims of persuading Andrew to seize church property, Andrew restored properties to the archbishop, who soon suspended the interdict. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal <a href="Giacomo%20Pecoraria">Giacomo Pecoraria</a> as his legate to Hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of <a href="Bereg%20County">Bereg</a>, he vowed that he would not employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. Andrew repeated his oath in <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a> in September.

Andrew and <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Austria">Frederick II, Duke of Austria</a>, signed a peace treaty in late 1233. Andrew, who had been widowed, married the 23-year-old <a href="Beatrice%20d%27Este%2C%20Queen%20of%20Hungary">Beatrice D'Este</a> on 14 May 1234, even though his sons were sharply opposed to his third marriage. John, Bishop of Bosnia, put Hungary under a new interdict in the first half of 1234, because Andrew had not dismissed his non-Christian officials despite his oath of Bereg. Andrew and Archbishop Robert of Esztergom protested against the bishop's act at the Holy See.

Danilo Romanovich laid siege to Halych, and Andrew's youngest son died during the siege in the autumn of 1234. However, Andrew stormed Austria in the summer of 1235, forcing Duke Frederick to pay an indemnification for damages that his troops had caused while raiding Hungary. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory declared on 31 August that Andrew and his sons could only be excommunicated by the authorization of the Holy See. Andrew died on 21 September, and was buried in <a href="Egres%20Abbey">Egres Abbey</a>.

Andrew's first wife, Gertrude of Merania, was born around 1185, according to historian Gyula Kristó. Their first child, <a href="Anna%20Maria%20of%20Hungary">Mary</a>, was born in 1203 or 1204. She became the wife of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. Andrew's eldest son, <a href="B%C3%A9la%20IV%20of%20Hungary">Béla</a>, was born in 1206. He later succeeded his father as king. Béla's younger sister, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Hungary">Elisabeth</a>, was born in 1207. She married <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Thuringia">Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia</a>. She died in 1231 and was <a href="Canonization">canonized</a> during Andrew's life. Andrew's second son, Coloman, was born in 1208. His third son, Andrew, was born around 1210. Coloman and Andrew each ruled the Principality of Halych for a short period.

Two years after his first wife was murdered, Andrew married Yolanda de Courtenay, who was born around 1198. Their only child, <a href="Violant%20of%20Hungary">Yolanda</a>, was born around 1219 and married <a href="James%20I%20of%20Aragon">James I of Aragon</a>. Andrew's third wife, Beatrice D'Este, was about twenty-three when they married in 1234. She gave birth to a son, <a href="Stephen%20the%20Posthumous">Stephen</a>, after Andrew's death. However, Andrew's two older sons, Béla and Coloman, accused her of adultery and considered her child to be a bastard. Her grandson, <a href="Andrew%20III%20of%20Hungary">Andrew</a>, became the last monarch of the <a href="House%20of%20%C3%81rp%C3%A1d">House of Árpád</a>.

An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding

An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a book by the Scottish <a href="Empiricism">empiricist</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, published in English in 1748. It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's "<a href="A%20Treatise%20of%20Human%20Nature">A Treatise of Human Nature</a>", published anonymously in <a href="London">London</a> in 1739–40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the "Treatise", which "fell dead-born from the press," as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.

The end product of his labours was the "Enquiry". The "Enquiry" dispensed with much of the material from the "Treatise", in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects. For example, Hume's views on <a href="personal%20identity">personal identity</a> do not appear. However, more vital propositions, such as Hume's argument for the role of <a href="Habit%20%28psychology%29">habit</a> in a theory of knowledge, are retained.

This book has proven highly influential, both in the years that would immediately follow and today. <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described "dogmatic slumber". The "Enquiry" is widely regarded as a classic in <a href="Modern%20philosophy">modern philosophical</a> literature.

The argument of the "Enquiry" proceeds by a series of incremental steps, separated into chapters which logically succeed one another. After expounding his <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics.

In the first section of the Enquiry, Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, as he calls it, "moral philosophy"). The latter investigates both actions and thoughts. He emphasizes in this section, by way of warning, that philosophers with nuanced thoughts will likely be cast aside in favor of those whose conclusions more intuitively match popular opinion. However, he insists, precision helps art and craft of all kinds, including the craft of philosophy.

Next, Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas. By "impressions", he means sensations, while by "ideas", he means memories and imaginings. According to Hume, the difference between the two is that ideas are less "vivacious" than impressions. For example, the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression (or sensation) of actually eating one. Writing within the tradition of <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>, he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas.

Hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation, or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation. According to Hume, the creative faculty makes use of (at least) four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense-impressions. These operations are "compounding" (or the addition of one idea onto another, such as a horn on a horse to create a <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a>); "transposing" (or the substitution of one part of a thing with the part from another, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a <a href="centaur">centaur</a>); "augmenting" (as with the case of a <a href="giant%20%28mythology%29">giant</a>, whose size has been augmented); and "diminishing" (as with <a href="Lilliput%20and%20Blefuscu">Lilliputians</a>, whose size has been diminished). (Hume 1974:317) In a later chapter, he also mentions the operations of "mixing", "separating", and "dividing". (Hume 1974:340) 

However, Hume admits that there is one objection to his account: the problem of ""<a href="The%20Missing%20Shade%20of%20Blue">The Missing Shade of Blue</a>"". In this thought-experiment, he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one (see Fig. 1). He predicts that this man will be able to divine the color of this particular shade of blue, despite the fact that he has never experienced it. This seems to pose a serious problem for the empirical account, though Hume brushes it aside as an exceptional case by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions. (Hume 1974:319)

In this chapter, Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: "resemblance", "contiguity" in space-time, and "cause-and-effect". He argues that there must be some "universal principle" that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas. However, he does not immediately show what this principle might be. (Hume 1974:320-321)

In the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either "relations of ideas" or "matters of fact", which is roughly the <a href="Analytic-synthetic%20distinction">distinction</a> between <a href="logical%20truth">analytic</a> and <a href="fact">synthetic propositions</a>. The former, he tells the reader, are proved by demonstration, while the latter are given through experience. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" reasoning. For Hume, every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily—they are entirely distinct from one another. (Hume 1974:324)

In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world:

He shows how a satisfying argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since "it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change") nor experience (since that would be a <a href="circular%20argument">circular argument</a>). (Hume 1974:330-332) Here he is describing what would become known as the <a href="problem%20of%20induction">problem of induction</a>.

For Hume, we assume that experience tells us something about the world because of "habit or custom", which human nature forces us to take seriously. This is also, presumably, the "principle" that organizes the connections between ideas. Indeed, one of the many famous passages of the "Inquiry" was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom. In a later chapter, he wrote:

In the second part, he provides an account of beliefs. He explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter doesn't. (Hume 1974:340)

This short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance. For him, "probability" means a "higher chance" of occurring, and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer. By "chance", he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience. However, further experience takes these equal chances, and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others. These gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes. This effect may be understood as another case of "custom or habit" taking past experience and using it to predict the future. (Hume 1974:346-348)

By "necessary connection", Hume means the power or force which necessarily ties one idea to another. He rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of some sense of the power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere <a href="Occasionalism">occasions of the will of some god(s)</a>, a view associated with the philosopher <a href="Nicolas%20Malebranche">Nicolas Malebranche</a>. (Hume 1974:356-359)

Having dispensed with these alternative explanations, he identifies the source of our knowledge of necessary connections as arising out of "observation of constant conjunction of certain impressions across many instances". In this way, people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit, and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will. (Hume 1974:361)

Here Hume tackles the problem of how <a href="liberty">liberty</a> may be reconciled with <a href="metaphysical%20necessity">metaphysical necessity</a> (otherwise known as a <a href="compatibilist">compatibilist</a> formulation of <a href="free%20will">free will</a>). Hume believes that all disputes on the subject have been merely verbal arguments—that is to say, arguments which are based on a lack of prior agreement on definitions. He first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic, but human actions are more controversial. However, he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system. To show the compatibility of necessity and liberty, Hume defines liberty as the ability to act on the basis of one's will e.g. the capacity to will one's actions but not to will one's will. He then shows (quite briefly) how determinism and free will are compatible notions, and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life.

Hume insists that the conclusions of the Enquiry will be very powerful if they can be shown to apply to animals and not just humans. He believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do: through learned expectations. (Hume 1974:384) He also notes that this "inferential" ability that animals have is not through reason, but custom alone. Hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share, namely, the ability to reason experimentally (through custom). Nevertheless, he admits, humans and animals differ in mental faculties in a number of ways, including: differences in memory and attention, inferential abilities, ability to make deductions in a long chain, ability to grasp ideas more or less clearly, the human capacity to worry about conflating unrelated circumstances, a sagely prudence which arrests generalizations, a capacity for a greater inner library of analogies to reason with, an ability to detach oneself and scrap one's own biases, and an ability to converse through language (and thus gain from the experience of others' testimonies). (Hume 1974:385, footnote 17.)

The next topic which Hume strives to give treatment is that of the reliability of human testimony, and of the role that <a href="social%20epistemology">testimony plays a part in epistemology</a>. This was not an idle concern for Hume. Depending on its outcome, the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles.

True to his empirical thesis, Hume tells the reader that, though testimony does have some force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some reasons why we may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389)

And there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony, also based on experience. If a) testimonies conflict one another, b) there are a small number of witnesses, c) the speaker has no integrity, d) the speaker is overly hesitant or bold, or e) the speaker is known to have motives for lying, then the epistemologist has reason to be skeptical of the speaker's claims. (Hume 1974:390)

There is one final criterion that Hume thinks gives us warrant to doubt any given testimony, and that is f) if the propositions being communicated are miraculous. Hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature. He argues that the laws of nature have an overwhelming body of evidence behind them, and are so well demonstrated to everyone's experience, that any deviation from those laws necessarily flies in the face of all evidence. (Hume 1974:391-392)

Moreover, he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity, for four reasons. First, he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts. Second, he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder, and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others. Third, he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism. Finally, since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is, one man's religious miracle may be contradicted by another man's miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self-denunciating. (Hume 1974:393-398)

Still, Hume takes care to warn that historians are generally to be trusted with confidence, so long as their reports on facts are extensive and uniform. However, he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity. Thus, if every historian were to claim that there was a solar eclipse in the year 1600, then though we might at first naively regard that as in violation of natural laws, we'd come to accept it as a fact. But if every historian were to assert that Queen Elizabeth was observed walking around happy and healthy after her funeral, and then interpreted that to mean that they had risen from the dead, then we'd have reason to appeal to natural laws in order to dispute their interpretation. (Hume 1974:400-402)

Hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell. The brunt of this chapter allegedly narrates the opinions, not of Hume, but of one of Hume's anonymous friends, who again presents them in an imagined speech by the philosopher <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a>. His friend argues that, though it is possible to <a href="abductive%20reasoning">trace a cause from an effect</a>, it is not possible to infer unseen effects from a cause thus traced. The friend insists, then, that even though we might postulate that there is a first cause behind all things—God—we can't infer anything about the afterlife, because we don't know anything of the afterlife from experience, and we can't infer it from the existence of God. (Hume 1974:408)

Hume offers his friend an objection: if we see an unfinished building, then can't we infer that it has been created by humans with certain intentions, and that it will be finished in the future? His friend concurs, but indicates that there is a relevant disanalogy that we can't pretend to know the contents of the mind of God, while we can know the designs of other humans. Hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend's reasoning. (Hume 1974:412-414)

The first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments. The treatment includes the arguments of atheism, Cartesian skepticism, "light" skepticism, and rationalist critiques of empiricism. Hume shows that even light skepticism leads to crushing doubts about the world which - while they ultimately are philosophically justifiable - may only be combated through the non-philosophical adherence to custom or habit. He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies.

In the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it.

He concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all. ""When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, "Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?" No. "Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?" No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.""

The criteria Hume lists in his examination of the validity of human testimony are roughly upheld in modern social psychology, under the rubric of the communication-persuasion paradigm. Supporting literature includes: the work of <a href="social%20impact%20theory">social impact theory</a>, which discusses persuasion in part through the number of persons engaging in influence; as well as studies made on the relative influence of communicator <a href="credibility">credibility</a> in different kinds of persuasion; and examinations of the <a href="Trust%20%28social%20sciences%29">trust</a>worthiness of the speaker.

The "custom" view of learning can in many ways be likened to <a href="associationist">associationist</a> psychology. This point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century. Still, testing on the subject has been somewhat divided. Testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect. However, it has been shown that some animals, like chimpanzees, were able to generate creative plans of action to achieve their goals, and thus would seem to have a causal insight which transcends mere custom.

André de Longjumeau

André de Longjumeau (also known as Andrew of Longjumeau in English) was a 13th-century <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> missionary and diplomat and one of the most active Occidental diplomats in the East in the 13th century. He led two embassies to the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongols</a>: the first carried letters from <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a> and the second bore gifts and letters from <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a> to <a href="G%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%20Khan">Güyük Khan</a>. Well acquainted with the <a href="Middle-East">Middle-East</a>, he spoke <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> and "<a href="Chaldean%20Neo-Aramaic">Chaldean</a>" (thought to be either <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> or <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>).

Andrew's first mission to the East was when he was asked by the French king <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX</a> to go and fetch the <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns">Crown of Thorns</a> which had been sold to him by the Latin Emperor of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> <a href="Baldwin%20II%20of%20Constantinople">Baldwin II</a> in 1238, who was anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire. Andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother Jacques.

Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a>. He left <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> in the spring of 1245 for the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. 
He visited Muslim principalities in <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and representatives of the <a href="Nestorianism">Nestorian</a> and <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Jacobite</a> churches in Persia, finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>. In Tabriz, André de Longjumeau met with a monk from the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, named <a href="Simeon%20Rabban%20Ata">Simeon Rabban Ata</a>, who had been put in charge by the <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">Khan</a> of protecting the Christians in the <a href="Middle-East">Middle-East</a>.

At the Mongol camp near <a href="Kars">Kars</a> Andrew had met a certain <a href="David%20and%20Mark">David</a>, who in December 1248 appeared at the court of King <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a> in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Andrew, who was now with Saint Louis, interpreted David's message to the King, a real or pretended offer of alliance from the Mongol general <a href="Eljigidei">Eljigidei</a>, and a proposal of a joint attack upon the Islamic powers of <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. In reply to this the French sovereign dispatched Andrew as his ambassador to <a href="G%C3%BCy%C3%BCk%20Khan">Güyük Khan</a>; with Longjumeau went his brother William (also a Dominican) and several others — John Goderiche, John of Carcassonne, Herbert "Le <a href="Sommelier">Sommelier</a>," Gerbert of Sens, Robert (a clerk), a certain William, and an unnamed clerk of <a href="Poissy">Poissy</a>.

The party set out on 27 January 1249, with letters from King Louis and the <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, and rich presents, including a chapel-tent, lined with scarlet cloth and embroidered with sacred pictures. From Cyprus they went to the port of <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in Syria, and thence traveled for a year to the Khan's court, going ten leagues (55.56 kilometers) per day. Their route led them through <a href="Iran">Persia</a>, along the southern and eastern shores of the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, and certainly through <a href="Taraz">Talas</a>, north-east of <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>.

On arrival at the supreme Mongol court — either that on the <a href="Imyl%20river">Imyl river</a> (near <a href="Lake%20Alakol">Lake Alakol</a> and the present Russo-Chinese frontier in the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai</a>), or more probably at or near <a href="Karakorum">Karakorum</a> itself, south-west of <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> — Andrew found Güyük Khan dead, poisoned, as the envoy supposed, by <a href="Batu%20Khan">Batu Khan</a>'s agents. The regent-mother <a href="Oghul%20Qaimish">Oghul Qaimish</a> (the "Camus" of <a href="William%20of%20Rubruck">William of Rubruck</a>) seems to have received and dismissed him with presents and a dismissive letter for Louis IX. But it is certain that before the friar had quit "Tartary" <a href="M%C3%B6ngke%20Khan">Möngke</a>, Güyük's successor, had been elected.

Andrew's report to his sovereign, whom he rejoined in 1251 at <a href="Caesarea%20Palaestina">Caesarea</a> in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, appears to have been a mixture of history and fable; the latter affects his narrative of the Mongols' rise to greatness, and the struggles of their leader <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> with <a href="Prester%20John">Prester John</a>; it is still more evident in the position assigned to the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>' homeland, close to the prison of <a href="Gog%20and%20Magog">Gog and Magog</a>. On the other hand, the envoy's account of Mongol customs is fairly accurate, and his statements about <a href="Christianity%20among%20the%20Mongols">Mongol Christianity</a> and its prosperity, though perhaps exaggerated (e.g. as to the 800 chapels on wheels in the nomadic host), are based on fact.

Mounds of bones marked his road, witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail. He found Christian prisoners from Germany in the heart of "Tartary" (at Talas), and was compelled to observe the ceremony of passing between two fires, as a bringer of gifts to a dead <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Khan</a>, gifts which were of course treated by the Mongols as evidence of submission. This insulting behaviour, and the language of the letter with which Andrew reappeared, marked the mission a failure: King Louis, says <a href="Jean%20de%20Joinville">Joinville</a>, ""se repenti fort"" ("felt very sorry").

Andrew died some time after 1253, while he was active as a missionary in Palestine. The <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> missionary, <a href="William%20of%20Rubruck">William of Rubruck</a>, in his work on Asian customs, declared that everything he had heard from Andrew on the subject was fully borne out by his own personal observations.

We only know of Andrew through references in other writers: see especially <a href="William%20of%20Rubruck">William of Rubruck</a>'s in "Recueil de voyages", iv. (Paris, 1839), pp. 261, 265, 279, 296, 310, 353, 363, 370; Joinville, ed. Francisque Michel (1858, etc.), pp. 142, etc.; Jean Pierre Sarrasin, in same vol., pp. 254–235; <a href="Guillaume%20de%20Nangis">William of Nangis</a> in "Recueil des historiens des Gaules", xx. 359–367; <a href="Charles%20de%20R%C3%A9musat">Rémusat</a>, "Mémoires sur les relations politiques des princes chrétiens… avec les… Mongols" (1822, etc.), p. 52.

Andriscus

Andriscus (, "Andrískos"), also often referenced as Pseudo-Philip, was the last <a href="King%20of%20Macedon">King of Macedon</a> ( 149–148 BC). A pretender, who claimed to be the son of <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus of Macedon</a>, he was a <a href="fulling">fuller</a> from <a href="Edremit%20%28District%29%2C%20Bal%C4%B1kesir">Adramyttium</a> in <a href="Aeolis">Aeolis</a> in western <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. His reign lasted just one year.

In 168 BC, the Romans invaded <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Macedonia</a> and overthrew king <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">First Battle of Pydna</a>.

In 149 BC, Andriskos, claiming to be Perseus' son, announced his intention to retake Macedonia from the Romans.

As his first attempt, he travelled to <a href="Syria">Syria</a> to request military help from <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Syria">Demetrius Soter of Syria</a>. Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans but Andriskos managed to escape from Roman captivity, and raised a <a href="Thracians">Thracian</a> army. With this army, he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor <a href="Publius%20Juventius">Publius Juventius</a> in 149 BC. Andriskos then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia.

In 148 BC, Andriskos conquered <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> and made an alliance with <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>, thus bringing the Roman wrath on him. 
Later that year, in what the Romans called the <a href="Fourth%20Macedonian%20War">Fourth Macedonian War</a>, he was defeated by the Roman praetor <a href="Quintus%20Caecilius%20Metellus%20Macedonicus">Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna%20%28148%20BC%29">Second Battle of Pydna</a>, and fled to <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, whose prince gave him up to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, thus marking the end to Andriskos' reign of Macedonia.

Andriscus' brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion. After this, Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province.

Andronikos III Palaiologos

Andronikos III Palaiologos (; 25 March 1297 – 15 June 1341), commonly <a href="Latinization%20of%20names">Latinized</a> as Andronicus III Palaeologus, was <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> from 1328 to 1341. Born Andronikos Doukas Angelos Komnenos Palaiologos (), he was the son of <a href="Michael%20IX%20Palaiologos">Michael IX Palaiologos</a> and <a href="Rita%20of%20Armenia">Rita of Armenia</a>. He was proclaimed co-emperor in his youth, before 1313, and in April 1321 he <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201321%E2%80%9328">rebelled in opposition</a> to his grandfather, <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a>. He was formally crowned co-emperor in February 1325, before ousting his grandfather outright and becoming sole emperor on 24 May 1328.

His reign included the last failed attempts to hold back the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> in <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a> and the defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rusokastro">Rusokastro</a> against the <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarians</a>, but also the successful recovery of <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>, <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a>, <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, and <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a>. His early death left a power vacuum that resulted in the disastrous <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201341%E2%80%9347">civil war</a> between his Empress-dowager, <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a>, and his closest friend and supporter, <a href="John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos">John VI Kantakouzenos</a>.

Andronikos was born in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> on 25 March 1297, the 38th birthday of his paternal grandfather, Byzantine Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a>. His father, <a href="Michael%20IX%20Palaiologos">Michael IX Palaiologos</a>, began reigning in full imperial style as co-emperor circa 1295.

In March 1318, Andronikos married <a href="Irene%20of%20Brunswick">Irene of Brunswick</a>, daughter of <a href="Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-Grubenhagen">Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen</a>. In circa 1321 she gave birth to a son, who died in infancy.

In 1320, Andronikos accidentally caused the death of his brother Manuel, after which their father, co-emperor <a href="Michael%20IX%20Palaiologos">Michael IX Palaiologos</a>, died in his grief. The homicide and the general dissolute behavior of Andronikos III and his coterie, mostly the young scions of the great aristocratic clans of the Empire, resulted in a deep rift in the relations between young Andronikos and his grandfather, still reigning as Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a>.

Emperor Andronikos II disowned his grandson Andronikos, who then fled the capital and rallied his supporters in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and began to reign as rival emperor in 1321. Andronikos then waged the intermittent <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201321%E2%80%9328">Byzantine civil war of 1321–28</a> against his reigning grandfather, who granted him to reign as co-emperor Andronikos III.

Empress Irene died on 16/17 August 1324 with no surviving child. <a href="Theodora%20Palaiologina%2C%20Empress%20of%20Bulgaria">Theodora Palaiologina</a>, sister of Andronikos III, married the new tsar <a href="Michael%20Shishman%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Shishman of Bulgaria</a> in 1324. Andronikos III, then a widower, married <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a> in October 1326. In 1327 she gave birth to Maria (renamed Irene) Palaiologina.

Andronikos III concluded the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Chernomen">Treaty of Chernomen</a> of 1327, an alliance with tsar Michael Shishman of Bulgaria against <a href="Stephen%20Uro%C5%A1%20III%20De%C4%8Danski%20of%20Serbia">Stephen Uroš III Dečanski of Serbia</a>. The Byzantine civil war flared again and ultimately led to the deposition in 1328 of Emperor Andronikos II, who retired to a monastery.

Ottoman Turks besieged <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a> in Asia Minor, historically the provisional capital of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> from the Fourth Crusade until the Byzantine recapture of Constantinople. Andronikos III launched a relief attempt, which Ottoman sultan <a href="Orhan">Orhan</a> defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pelekanon">Battle of Pelekanon</a> on 10 or 15 June 1329. Nevertheless, Andronikos III effected the recovery of <a href="Lordship%20of%20Chios">Lordship of Chios</a> (including <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>) from <a href="Martino%20Zaccaria">Martino Zaccaria</a> in a naval battle, also in 1329.

An alliance with Bulgaria failed to secure any gains for the Byzantine empire. On 28 July 1330, the Serbians decisively defeated the Bulgarians in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Velbazhd">Battle of Velbazhd</a> (modern <a href="Kyustendil">Kyustendil</a>, Bulgaria) without significant Byzantine participation. The Ottomans continued to advance in 1331, finally taking <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a> (renamed <a href="%C4%B0znik">İznik</a>). Andronikos III wanted <a href="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a> and the other few Byzantine forts in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> not to suffer the same fate and sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute.

Andronikos III reorganized and attempted to strengthen the weakened <a href="Byzantine%20navy">Byzantine navy</a>, which comprised only 10 ships by 1332; in emergencies, he still could muster a hundred extra merchant ships.

To overcome his failure to secure gains against the Serbians, Andronikos III attempted to annex Bulgarian Thrace, but the new tsar <a href="Ivan%20Alexander%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria</a> defeated Byzantine forces at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rusokastro">Battle of Rusokastro</a> on 18 July 1332. Territorial concessions and a diplomatic marriage between the son of the Bulgarian emperor, the future <a href="Michael%20Asen%20IV%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Asen IV of Bulgaria</a>, and Maria (renamed Irene) Palaiologina, daughter of Andronikos III Palaiologos, secured peace with Bulgaria.

The Muslim traveler <a href="Ibn%20Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a> visited Constantinople towards the end of 1332 and mentions meeting Andronikos III in his memoirs. Byzantine sources do not attest to the meeting.

<a href="Stephen%20Gabrielopoulos">Stephen Gabrielopoulos</a>, ruler over <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, died circa 1333; taking advantage of the secession crisis, Andronikos III extended Byzantine control over the region.

<a href="Syrgiannes%20Palaiologos">Syrgiannes Palaiologos</a>, entrusted with the governorship of <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessalonica</a>, deserted to the side of king <a href="Stephen%20Uro%C5%A1%20IV%20Du%C5%A1an%20of%20Serbia">Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia</a> and aided their advance in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>. He led the Serbians to take <a href="Kastoria">Kastoria</a>, <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, <a href="Prilep">Prilep</a>, <a href="Strumica">Strumica</a>, and possibly <a href="Edessa%2C%20Greece">Edessa</a> circa 1334 and advanced as far as Thessalonica. Byzantine general Sphrantzes Palaiologos, posing as a deserter, entered the Serbian camp and killed Syrgiannes Palaiologos, ending his advance and bringing the Serbian army into disarray. In August 1334, the king of Serbia made peace with Andronikos III and allowed his forces to retake control of captured parts of Macedonia.

Andronikos III meanwhile effected the recovery of <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a> in 1334 from the last Genoese governor, <a href="Domenico%20Cattaneo">Domenico Cattaneo</a>. However, this victory failed to stem significantly the Ottoman advance in Asia Minor. Byzantine rule gradually vanished from Anatolia as tribute failed to appease Ottoman sultan <a href="Orhan">Orhan</a>, who took <a href="Nicomedia">Nicomedia</a> (renamed <a href="%C4%B0zmit">İzmit</a>) in 1337, leaving only <a href="Ala%C5%9Fehir">Philadelpheia</a> and a handful of ports under Byzantine control.

Despite these troubles, Andronikos III took advantage of a secession crisis in <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a> to seize Byzantine control from <a href="Nikephoros%20II%20Orsini">Nikephoros II Orsini</a> in 1337.

<a href="John%20Kantakouzenos">John Kantakouzenos</a>, "<a href="megas%20domestikos">megas domestikos</a>" of Andronikos III and later emperor, wielded effective administrative authority during the reign, while the Emperor personally enjoyed hunting and waging war.

Andronikos III also reformed the judiciary through his creation of a panel of four judges, designated "Universal Justices of the Romans" ("<a href="katholikoi%20kritai">katholikoi kritai</a> ton Rhomaion").

Andronikos III was first married in 1318 with <a href="Irene%20of%20Brunswick">Irene of Brunswick</a>, daughter of <a href="Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>; she died in 1324. They had an unnamed son, who died shortly after birth in 1321.

In 1326, Andronikos III married as his second wife <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a>, daughter of Count <a href="Amadeus%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus V, Count of Savoy</a> and of his second wife <a href="Marie%20of%20Brabant%2C%20Countess%20of%20Savoy">Marie of Brabant, Countess of Savoy</a>. Their marriage produced several children, including:


According to Byzantine historian <a href="Nicephorus%20Gregoras">Nicephorus Gregoras</a>, Andronikos also had an illegitimate daughter, <a href="Irene%20Palaiologina%20of%20Trebizond">Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond</a>, who married emperor <a href="Basil%20of%20Trebizond">Basil of Trebizond</a> and took over the throne of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a> from 1340 to 1341.

In his "Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople" (1983), Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza mentions a second illegitimate daughter of Andronikos, who converted (likely under duress) to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> under the name Bayalun as one among several wives of <a href="%C3%96z%20Beg%20Khan">Öz Beg Khan</a> of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a>. This daughter is also earlier mentioned in the 14th century traveller <a href="Ibn%20Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>'s work The Travels , in which Ibn Battuta claimed that he had accompanied Bayalun traveling from Khan's court to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza, "Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d'Albanie et de Constantinople" (1983), page 373</ref> Detlev Schwennicke does not include this daughter in "<a href="Europ%C3%A4ische%20Stammtafeln">Europäische Stammtafeln</a>: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten" (1978), and the theory of her existence may reflect theories of Sturdza.

Andronikos III died at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, aged 44, on 15 June 1341, possibly due to chronic <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Historians contend that his reign ended with the Byzantine Empire in a still-tenable situation and generally do not implicate deficiencies in his leadership in its later demise. <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a> succeeded his father as Byzantine emperor, but at only 9 years of age, he required a regent.

The energetic campaigns of emperor Andronikos III simply lacked sufficient strength to defeat the imperial enemies and led to several significant Byzantine reverses at the hands of Bulgarians, Serbians, and Ottomans. Andronikos III nevertheless provided active leadership and cooperated with able administrators. The empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkans and Greek peninsula after the Fourth Crusade. The loss of a few imperial territories in Anatolia, however, left the Ottoman Turks poised to expand into Europe.

Within a few months after the death of Andronikos III, controversy over the right to exercise the regency over the new emperor John V Palaiologos and the position of John Kantakouzenos as all-powerful chief minister and friend of Andronikos led to the outbreak of the destructive <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201341%E2%80%9347">Byzantine civil war of 1341–47</a>, which consumed the resources of the empire and left it in an untenable position. The weakened Byzantine Empire failed to prevent the formation of the Serbian Empire or, more ominously, the Ottoman invasion of Europe.

Andronikos II Palaiologos

Andronikos II Palaiologos (; 25 March 1259 – 13 February 1332), usually <a href="Latinization%20of%20names">Latinized</a> as Andronicus II Palaeologus, was <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> from 11 December 1282 to 23 or 24 May 1328.

Andronikos II was born Andronikos Doukas Angelos Komnenos Palaiologos () at <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a>. He was the eldest surviving son of <a href="Michael%20VIII%20Palaiologos">Michael VIII Palaiologos</a> and <a href="Theodora%20Palaiologina%20%28Byzantine%20empress%29">Theodora Palaiologina</a>, grandniece of <a href="John%20III%20Doukas%20Vatatzes">John III Doukas Vatatzes</a>.

Andronikos was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261, after his father Michael VIII recovered <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> from the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a>, but he was not crowned until 1272. Sole emperor from 1282, Andronikos II immediately repudiated his father's unpopular Church union with the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>, which he had been forced to support while his father was still alive, but he was unable to resolve the related schism within the Orthodox clergy until 1310.

Andronikos II was also plagued by economic difficulties. During his reign the value of the Byzantine "<a href="hyperpyron">hyperpyron</a>" depreciated precipitously, while the state treasury accumulated less than one seventh the revenue (in nominal coins) that it had previously. Seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenses, Andronikos II raised taxes, reduced tax exemptions, and dismantled the Byzantine fleet (80 ships) in 1285, thereby making the Empire increasingly dependent on the rival republics of <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoa</a>. In 1291, he hired 50–60 Genoese ships, but the Byzantine weakness resulting from the lack of a navy became painfully apparent in the two wars with Venice in <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281296%E2%80%931302%29">1296–1302</a> and <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281306%E2%80%9310%29">1306–10</a>. Later, in 1320, he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys, but failed.

Andronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> through diplomacy. After the death of his first wife Anne of Hungary, he married <a href="Irene%20of%20Montferrat">Yolanda (renamed Irene) of Montferrat</a>, putting an end to the Montferrat claim to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Thessalonica">Kingdom of Thessalonica</a>. Andronikos II also attempted to marry off his son and co-emperor <a href="Michael%20IX%20Palaiologos">Michael IX Palaiologos</a> to the Latin Empress <a href="Catherine%20I%20of%20Courtenay">Catherine I of Courtenay</a>, thus seeking to eliminate Western agitation for a restoration of the Latin Empire. Another marriage alliance attempted to resolve the potential conflict with <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, as Andronikos II married off his five-year-old daughter <a href="Simonida">Simonis</a> to King <a href="Stefan%20Milutin">Stefan Milutin</a> in 1298.

In spite of the resolution of problems in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, Andronikos II was faced with the collapse of the Byzantine frontier in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, despite the successful, but short, governorships of <a href="Alexios%20Philanthropenos">Alexios Philanthropenos</a> and <a href="John%20Tarchaneiotes">John Tarchaneiotes</a>. The successful military victories in Asia Minor by <a href="Alexios%20Philanthropenos">Alexios Philanthropenos</a> and <a href="John%20Tarchaneiotes">John Tarchaneiotes</a> against the Turks were largely dependent on a considerable military contingent of Cretan escapees, or exiles from Venetian-occupied Crete, headed by Hortatzis, whom <a href="Michael%20VIII">Michael VIII</a> had repatriated to Byzantium through a treaty agreement with the Venetians ratified in 1277. Andronikos II had resettled those Cretans in the region of Meander river, the southeastern Asia Minor frontier of Byzantium with the Turks.

After the failure of the co-emperor Michael IX to stem the Turkish advance in Asia Minor in 1302 and the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Bapheus">Battle of Bapheus</a>, the Byzantine government hired the <a href="Catalan%20Company">Catalan Company</a> of <a href="Almogavars">Almogavars</a> (adventurers from <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>) led by <a href="Roger%20de%20Flor">Roger de Flor</a> to clear Byzantine Asia Minor of the enemy. In spite of some successes, the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains. Being more ruthless and savage than the enemy they intended to subdue they quarreled with Michael IX, and eventually openly turned on their Byzantine employers after the murder of Roger de Flor in 1305; together with a party of willing Turks they devastated <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, Macedonia, and <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> on their road to Latin occupied southern Greece. There they conquered the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a> and <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>. The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions, and <a href="Bursa%2C%20Turkey">Prusa</a> fell in 1326. By the end of Andronikos II's reign, much of Bithynia was in the hands of the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> of Osman I and his son and heir <a href="Orhan%20I">Orhan</a>. Also, <a href="Karasids">Karasids</a> conquered <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>-region with <a href="Bal%C4%B1kesir">Paleokastron</a> after 1296, Germiyan conquered <a href="Simav">Simav</a> in 1328, Saruhan captured <a href="Manisa">Magnesia</a> in 1313, and <a href="Aydinids">Aydinids</a> captured <a href="%C4%B0zmir">Smyrna</a> in 1310.

The Empire's problems were exploited by <a href="Theodore%20Svetoslav%20of%20Bulgaria">Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria</a>, who defeated Michael IX and conquered much of northeastern Thrace in . The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage, between Michael IX's daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor. The dissolute behavior of Michael IX's son <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a> led to a rift in the family, and after Michael IX's death in 1320, Andronikos II disowned his grandson, prompting a <a href="First%20Palaiologan%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> that raged, with interruptions, until 1328. The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement, and <a href="Michael%20Shishman%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Asen III of Bulgaria</a> attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support. In 1328 Andronikos III entered Constantinople in triumph and Andronikos II was forced to abdicate.

Andronikos II died as a monk at Constantinople in 1332.

On 8 November 1273 Andronikos II married as his first wife <a href="Anna%20of%20Hungary%20%281260%E2%80%931281%29">Anna of Hungary</a>, daughter of <a href="Stephen%20V%20of%20Hungary">Stephen V of Hungary</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20the%20Cuman">Elizabeth the Cuman</a>, with whom he had two sons:

Anna died in 1281, and in 1284 Andronikos married <a href="Irene%20of%20Montferrat">Yolanda (renamed Irene)</a>, a daughter of <a href="William%20VII%20of%20Montferrat">William VII of Montferrat</a>, with whom he had:

Andronikos II also had at least two illegitimate daughters:

Andronikos I Komnenos

Andronikos I Komnenos (;  – 12 September 1185), usually <a href="Latinization%20of%20names">Latinized</a> as Andronicus I Comnenus, was <a href="Byzantine%20Emperors">Byzantine Emperor</a> from 1183 to 1185. He was the son of <a href="Isaac%20Komnenos%20%28d.%201152%29">Isaac Komnenos</a> and the grandson of the emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I</a>.

Andronikos Komnenos was born around 1118. He was handsome and eloquent, active, hardy, courageous, a great general and an able politician, but also licentious. His early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service.

In 1141 he was taken captive by the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a> and remained in their hands for a year. On being ransomed, he went to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, where he was held at the court of his cousin, the Emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Comnenus">Manuel I Komnenos</a>, to whom he was a great favourite. Here the charms of his niece, Eudoxia, attracted him and she became his mistress. In 1152, accompanied by Eudoxia, he set out for an important command in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. <a href="Battle%20of%20Mamistra">Failing</a> in his principal enterprise, an attack upon <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a>, he returned but was again appointed to the command of a province. This second post he seems also to have left after a short interval, for he appeared again in Constantinople and narrowly escaped death at the hands of the brothers of Eudoxia.

About 1153, a conspiracy against the Emperor in which Andronikos participated was discovered, and he was thrown in prison. After repeated unsuccessful attempts, he escaped in 1165. After passing through many dangers, including captivity in <a href="Vlach">Vlach</a> territory, he reached <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, where his cousin <a href="Yaroslav%20Osmomysl">Yaroslav Osmomysl</a> of <a href="Principality%20of%20Halych">Galicia</a> held court. While under the protection of Yaroslav, Andronikos formed an alliance with the Emperor Manuel I, and with a <a href="Principality%20of%20Halych">Galician</a> army he joined Manuel in the invasion of <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, assisting at the siege of <a href="Zemun">Semlin</a>. The campaign was successful, and Andronikos returned to Constantinople with Manuel I in 1168; a year later, however, Andronikos refused to take the oath of allegiance to the future king <a href="B%C3%A9la%20III%20of%20Hungary">Béla III of Hungary</a>, whom Manuel desired to become his successor. Andronikos was removed from court but received the province of <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>.

Still under the displeasure of the Emperor, Andronikos fled to the court of <a href="Raymond%20of%20Antioch">Raymond</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Prince of Antioch</a>. While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the Prince, <a href="Philippa%20of%20Antioch">Philippa</a>, sister of the Empress <a href="Maria%20of%20Antioch">Maria</a>. The Emperor was again angered by this dishonour, and Andronikos was compelled to flee. He took refuge with King <a href="Amalric%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Amalric I of Jerusalem</a>, whose favour he gained, and who invested him with the <a href="Principality%20of%20Galilee">Lordship of Beirut</a>. In Jerusalem he saw <a href="Theodora%20Komnene%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Theodora Komnene</a>, the beautiful widow of King <a href="Baldwin%20III%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin III</a> and niece of the Emperor Manuel. Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old, age had not diminished his charms, and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction. To avoid the vengeance of the Emperor, she fled with Andronikos to the court of <a href="Nur%20ad-Din%20Zangi">Nur ad-Din</a>, the <a href="Rulers%20of%20Damascus">Sultan of Damascus</a>. Feeling unsafe there, they continued their perilous journey through the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. They were well received by King <a href="George%20III%20of%20Georgia">George III of Georgia</a>, whose anonymous sister had probably been the first wife of Andronikos.

Andronikos was granted estates in <a href="Kakhetia">Kakhetia</a>, in the east of Georgia. In 1173 or 1174, he accompanied the Georgian army on an expedition to <a href="Shirvan">Shirvan</a> up to the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian</a> shores, where George recaptured the fortress of Shabaran from the invaders from <a href="Derbent">Darband</a> for his cousin, the <a href="Shirvanshah">Shirvanshah</a> <a href="Akhsitan%20I%20ibn%20Minuchihr%20III">Akhsitan I</a>. Finally, Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at <a href="Oinaion">Oinaion</a>, on the shores of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, between <a href="Trabzon">Trebizond</a> and <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinope</a>. While Andronikos was on one of his incursions into Trebizond, his castle was surprised by the governor of that province, and Theodora and her two children were captured and sent to Constantinople. To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and, appearing in chains before him, besought pardon. This he obtained, and he was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion.

In 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son <a href="Alexius%20II%20Comnenus">Alexios II</a>, who was under the guardianship of his mother, Empress Maria. Her Latin origins and culture led to creeping resentment from her Greek subjects. They had felt insulted by the Western tastes of Manuel, and being ruled by his Western wife built tensions to an explosion of rioting that almost became a full civil war. This gave Andronikos the opportunity to seize the crown for himself, leaving his retirement in 1182 and marching to Constantinople with an army that (according to non-Byzantine sources) included Muslim contingents. The defection of the commander of the Byzantine navy, "<a href="megas%20doux">megas doux</a>" <a href="Andronikos%20Kontostephanos">Andronikos Kontostephanos</a>, and the general Andronikos Angelos, played a key role in allowing the rebellious forces to enter Constantinople.

The arrival of Andronikos Komnenos was soon followed by a <a href="Massacre%20of%20the%20Latins">massacre of the city's Latin inhabitants</a>, who virtually controlled its economy, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Westerners. He was believed to have arranged the poisoning of Alexios II's elder sister <a href="Maria%20Komnene%20%28Porphyrogenita%29">Maria the Porphyrogenita</a> and her husband <a href="Renier%20of%20Montferrat">Renier of Montferrat</a>, although Maria herself had encouraged him to intervene; the poisoner was said to be the <a href="Eunuch%20%28court%20official%29">eunuch</a> Pterygeonites. Soon afterwards Andronikos had the Empress Maria imprisoned and then killed — forcing a signature from the child Emperor Alexios to put his mother to death — by Pterygeonites and the "<a href="hetaireiarches">hetaireiarches</a>" Constantine Tripsychos. Alexios II was compelled to acknowledge Andronikos as colleague in the empire in front of the crowd on the terrace of the <a href="Arslan%20Hane%2C%20Istanbul">Church of Christ of the Chalkè</a> and was then quickly put to death in turn; the killing was carried out by Tripsychos, Theodore Dadibrenos, and <a href="Stephen%20Hagiochristophorites">Stephen Hagiochristophorites</a>.

In 1183, sixty-five year old Andronikos married twelve-year-old <a href="Agnes%20of%20France%2C%20Empress%20consort%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Agnes of France</a>, daughter of King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> and his third wife <a href="Ad%C3%A8le%20of%20Champagne">Adèle of Champagne</a> — Agnes had been betrothed to Alexios II. By November 1183, Andronikos had associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne. In 1184, a Venetian embassy visited Constantinople, and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1,500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171.

The reign of Andronikos was characterized by his harsh measures. He resolved to suppress many abuses but above all things to check <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> and limit the power of the nobles, who were rivals for his throne. The people, who felt the severity of his laws, at the same time acknowledged their justice and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors, who had grown corrupt under the safety and opulence of Manuel I's rule. Andronikos became increasingly paranoid and violent, however, and the Empire descended into a terror state.. In September 1185, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, exiles, and their families for collusion with the invaders. The aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him, and there were several revolts.

The stories of chaos led to an invasion by King <a href="William%20II%20of%20Sicily">William</a> of the Norman Sicilians. William landed in <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a> with a strong force of 200 ships and 80,000 men, including 5,000 knights, and marched as far as <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>, which he <a href="Sack%20of%20Thessalonica%20%281185%29">took and pillaged</a> ruthlessly (7,000 Greeks died). Andronikos hastily assembled five different armies to stop the Sicilian army from reaching Constantinople, but his forces failed to stand and retreated to the outlying hills. Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor, <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelus">Isaac Angelos</a>.

Andronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy, and his plans were nearly successful. But on September 11, 1185, during his absence from the capital Stephen Hagiochristophorites, his lieutenant, moved to arrest <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelus">Isaac Angelos</a>, whose loyalty was suspect. Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. He appealed to the populace, and a tumult arose that spread rapidly over the whole city.

When Andronikos arrived he found that Isaac had been proclaimed Emperor. The deposed Emperor attempted to escape in a boat with his wife Agnes and his mistress, but they were captured (though some claim that Andronikos survived and managed to escape to the then-self-proclaimed Kingdom of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>). Isaac handed him over to the city mob and for three days he was exposed to their fury and resentment, remaining for that period tied to a post and beaten. His right hand was cut off, his teeth and hair were pulled out, one of his eyes was gouged out, and, among many other sufferings, boiling water was thrown in his face, punishment probably associated with his handsomeness and life of licentiousness. At last he was led to the <a href="Hippodrome%20of%20Constantinople">Hippodrome of Constantinople</a> and hung by his feet between two pillars. Two Latin soldiers competed as to whose sword would penetrate his body more deeply, and he was, according to the representation of his death, torn apart. He died on September 12, 1185. At the news of the emperor's death, his son and co-emperor John was murdered by his own troops in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>.
Andronikos I was the last of the <a href="Comnenus">Komnenoi</a> to rule Constantinople, although his grandsons <a href="Alexios%20I%20of%20Trebizond">Alexios</a> and <a href="David%20Komnenos">David</a> founded the <a href="Empire%20of%20Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a> in 1204. Their branch of the dynasty was known as the "Great Komnenoi" ("Megaskomnenoi").

Andronikos I Komnenos was married twice and had numerous mistresses. By his first wife, whose name is not known, he had three children:
By his mistress <a href="Theodora%20Komnene%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Theodora Komnene</a>, Andronikos I had the following children:

Andronikos is the main protagonist in Michael Arnold's "Against the Fall of Night" (Garden City, New York: Doubleday 1975), as well as Ange Vlachos' "Their Most Serene Majesties" (Vanguard Press, 1964).

He is mentioned in the <a href="Louis%20L%27Amour">Louis L'Amour</a> medieval historical novel, "<a href="The%20Walking%20Drum">The Walking Drum</a>", with his gruesome death foreseen by the protagonist in a vision.

He is among the main characters of the historical novel "Agnes of France" (1980) by <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> writer <a href="Kostas%20Kyriazis">Kostas Kyriazis</a> (b. 1920). The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes. The novel ends with the death of Andronikos.

Andronikos was portrayed in the novel "<a href="Baudolino">Baudolino</a>" by <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a>, with much detail being given to his grisly end.

Andronicus of Rhodes (, "Andrónikos ho Rhódios"; ;  BC) was a <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosopher</a> from <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> who was also the <a href="scholarch">scholarch</a> (head) of the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a>.

Andronicus wrote a work upon Aristotle, the fifth book of which contained a complete list of the philosopher's writings, and he also wrote commentaries upon the "Physics", "Ethics", and "Categories".

<doc id="1767" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1767" title="Ammianus Marcellinus">
Ammianus Marcellinus

Ammianus Marcellinus (born 330, died 400) was a <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> soldier and historian who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from Antiquity (preceding <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a>). His work, known as the Res Gestae, chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from the accession of the emperor <a href="Nerva">Nerva</a> in 96 to the death of <a href="Valens">Valens</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Battle of Adrianople</a> in 378, although only the sections covering the period 353–378 survive.

Ammianus was born between 325 and 330 in the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>-speaking East, possibly in Syria or Phoenicia. His native language was most likely Greek; he learned Latin as a second language, and was probably familiar with Syriac as well. The surviving books of his history cover the years 353 to 378.

Ammianus served as a soldier in the army of <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> and <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a> in Gaul and <a href="Persia">Persia</a>. He professes to have been "a former soldier and a <a href="Greek%20people">Greek</a>" ("miles quondam et graecus"), and his enrollment among the elite "protectores domestici" (household guards) shows that he was of middle class or higher birth. Consensus is that Ammianus probably came from a curial family, but it is also possible that he was the son of a "comes Orientis" of the same family name. He entered the army at an early age, when <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> was emperor of the East, and was sent to serve under <a href="Ursicinus%20%28Roman%20general%29">Ursicinus</a>, governor of <a href="Nisibis">Nisibis</a> in <a href="Mesopotamia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Mesopotamia</a>, and "magister militum".

He returned with Ursicinus to Italy when Ursicinus was recalled by Constantius to begin an expedition against <a href="Claudius%20Silvanus">Claudius Silvanus</a>. Silvanus had been forced by the allegedly false accusations of his enemies into proclaiming himself emperor in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. Ammianus campaigned in the East twice under Ursicinus. On one occasion he was separated from the officer's entourage and took refuge in <a href="Amida%20%28Roman%20city%29">Amida</a> during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Amida">siege of the city</a> by the Sassanids of <a href="shah">shah</a> <a href="Shapur%20II">Shapur II</a>; he reportedly barely escaped with his life.

When Ursicinus was dismissed from his military post by Constantinus, Ammianus too seems to have retired from the military; however, reevaluation of his participation in <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian's</a> Persian campaigns has led modern scholarship to suggest that he continued his service but did not for some reason include the period in his history.
He accompanied Julian, for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration, in his campaigns against the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a> and the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanids</a>. 
After Julian's death, Ammianus accompanied retreat of the new emperor <a href="Jovian%20%28Emperor%29">Jovian</a> as far as Antioch. 
He was residing in Antioch in 372 when a certain <a href="Theodorus%20%28usurper%29">Theodorus</a> was thought to have been identified the successor to the emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a> by divination. 
Speaking as an alleged eyewitness, Marcellinus recounts how Theodorus and several others were made to confess their deceit through the use of torture, and cruelly punished.
He eventually settled in Rome and began the "Res Gestae". The precise year of his death is unknown, but scholarly consensus places it somewhere between 392 and 400 at the latest.

Modern scholarship generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was tolerant of Christianity. Marcellinus writes of Christianity as being a pure and simple religion that demands only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so on the basis of their Christianity as such. His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the <a href="Arian%20controversy">Arian controversy</a>) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk going very far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.

He was not blind to the faults of Christians or of pagans; he observed in his "Res Gestae" that "no wild beasts are so deadly to humans as most Christians are to each other." and he condemns his hero Julian for excessive attachment to (pagan) sacrifice, and for his edict effectively barring Christians from teaching posts.

While living in Rome in the 380s, Ammianus wrote a Latin history of the Roman empire from the accession of <a href="Nerva">Nerva</a> (96) to the death of Valens at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Battle of Adrianople</a> (378), in effect writing a continuation of the history of <a href="Gaius%20Cornelius%20Tacitus">Tacitus</a>. He presumably completed the work before 391, as at 22.16.12 he praises the <a href="Serapeum">Serapeum</a> in Egypt as the glory of the empire; it was in that same year the Emperor granted the temple grounds to a Christian bishop, provoking pagans into barricading themselves in the temple, plundering its contents, and torturing Christians, ultimately destroying the temple. The "Res Gestae" ("Rerum gestarum Libri XXXI") was originally composed of thirty-one books, but the first thirteen have been lost (historian T.D. Barnes argues that the original was actually thirty-six books, which if correct would mean that eighteen books have been lost). The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378. As a whole it is extremely valuable, constituting the foundation of modern understanding of the history of the fourth century Roman Empire. It is lauded as a clear, comprehensive, and generally impartial account of events by a contemporary; like many ancient historians, however, Ammianus was in fact not impartial, although he expresses an intention to be so, and had strong moral and religious prejudices. Although criticised as lacking literary merit by his early biographers, he was in fact quite skilled in rhetoric, which significantly has brought the veracity of some of the "Res Gestae" into question.

His work has suffered terribly from manuscript transmission. Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books, the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacunose</a>. The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century <a href="Charlemagne">Carolingian</a> text, Vatican lat. 1873 ("V"), produced in <a href="Fulda">Fulda</a> from an insular exemplar. The only independent textual source for Ammianus lies in Fragmenta Marbugensia ("M"), another ninth-century <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> <a href="codex">codex</a> which was taken apart to provide covers for account-books during the fifteenth century. Only six leaves of "M" survive; however, before this manuscript was dismantled the Abbot of Hersfeld lent the manuscript to <a href="Sigismund%20Gelenius">Sigismund Gelenius</a>, who used it in preparing the text of the second Froben edition ("G"). The dates and relationship of V and M were long disputed until 1936 when R. P. Robinson demonstrated persuasively that V was copied from M. As L.D. Reynolds summarizes, "M is thus a fragment of the archetype; symptoms of an insular pre-archetype are evident."

His handling from his earliest printers was little better. The "<a href="editio%20princeps">editio princeps</a>" was printed in 1474 in Rome by Georg Sachsel and Bartholomaeus Golsch from "the worst of the "recentiores"", which broke off at the end of pageRank.Book 26. The next edition (Bologna, 1517) suffered from its editor's "monstrously bad conjectures" upon the poor text of the 1474 edition; the 1474 edition was pirated for the first Froben edition (Basle, 1518). It wasn't until 1533 that the last five books of Ammianus' history were put into print by Silvanus Otmar and edited by Mariangelus Accursius. The first modern edition was produced by C.U. Clark (Berlin, 1910–1913). The first English translations were by <a href="Philemon%20Holland">Philemon Holland</a> in 1609, and later by <a href="Charles%20Duke%20Yonge">C.D. Yonge</a> in 1862.

<a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> judged Ammianus "an accurate and faithful guide, who composed the history of his own times without indulging the prejudices and passions which usually affect the mind of a contemporary." But he also condemned Ammianus for lack of literary flair: "The coarse and undistinguishing pencil of Ammianus has delineated his bloody figures with tedious and disgusting accuracy." Austrian historian praised Ammianus as "the greatest literary genius that the world produced between Tacitus and Dante".

According to <a href="Kimberly%20Kagan">Kimberly Kagan</a>, his accounts of battles emphasize the experience of the soldiers but at the cost of ignoring the bigger picture. As a result, it is difficult for the reader to understand why the battles he describes had the outcome they did.

Ammianus' work contains a detailed description of the <a href="365%20Crete%20earthquake">tsunami</a> in Alexandria which devastated the metropolis and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean on 21 July 365. His report describes accurately the characteristic sequence of earthquake, retreat of the sea and sudden giant wave.

According to the <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">"Encyclopædia Britannica" Eleventh Edition</a>, "[i]t is a striking fact that Ammianus, though a professional soldier, gives excellent pictures of social and economic problems, and in his attitude to the non-Roman peoples of the empire he is far more broad-minded than writers like Livy and Tacitus; his digressions on the various countries he had visited are peculiarly interesting. In his description of the empire—the exhaustion produced by excessive taxation, the financial ruin of the middle classes, the progressive decline in the morale of the army—we find the explanation of its <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">fall</a> before the Goths twenty years after his death."

Apollo 13

Apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo space program</a> and the third intended to <a href="moon%20landing">land on the Moon</a>. The craft was launched on April 11, 1970, at 13:13 <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28Americas%29">CST</a> (19:13 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>) from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%2C%20Florida">Kennedy Space Center, Florida</a>, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later, crippling the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) upon which the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> (CM) had depended. Despite great hardship caused by limited power, loss of cabin heat, shortage of <a href="potable%20water">potable water</a>, and the critical need to make <a href="Jury%20rig">makeshift repairs</a> to the carbon dioxide removal system, the crew returned safely to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> on April 17, 1970, six days after launch.

The flight passed the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a> at an altitude of above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, a <a href="List%20of%20spaceflight%20records%23Farthest%20humans%20from%20Earth">spaceflight record</a> marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth. The mission was commanded by <a href="Jim%20Lovell">James A. Lovell</a> with <a href="Jack%20Swigert">John L. "Jack" Swigert</a> as Command Module Pilot and <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred W. Haise</a> as Lunar Module Pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a>, who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to <a href="Rubella">German measles</a>.

The story of the Apollo 13 mission has been dramatized multiple times, most notably in the 1995 film "<a href="Apollo%2013%20%28film%29">Apollo 13</a>".

According to the standard crew rotation in place during the Apollo program, the prime crew for Apollo 13 would have been the backup crew for <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a> with Mercury and Gemini veteran <a href="L.%20Gordon%20Cooper">L. Gordon Cooper</a> in command. That crew was composed of

<a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, never intended to rotate Cooper and Eisele to another mission, as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> and an extra-marital <a href="affair">affair</a>). He assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made. Slayton felt Cooper had no more than a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command, "if" he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Despite Eisele's issues with management, Slayton always intended to assign him to a future <a href="Apollo%20Applications%20Program">Apollo Applications Program</a> mission rather than a lunar mission, but this program was eventually cut down to only the <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> component.

Thus, the original assignment Slayton submitted to his superiors for this flight was:


For the first time ever, Slayton's recommendation was rejected by management, who felt that Shepard needed more time to train properly for a lunar flight, as he had only recently benefited from experimental surgery to correct an <a href="Meniere%27s%20disease">inner ear disorder</a> which had kept him grounded since <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">his first Mercury flight</a> in 1961. Thus, Lovell's crew, backup for the historic <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> mission and therefore slated for <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, was swapped with Shepard's crew and the original crew selection for the mission became:
Prime crew:
Backup crew:
Ken Mattingly was originally intended as the Command Module Pilot. Seven days before launch, the Backup Lunar Module Pilot, Charlie Duke, contracted <a href="rubella">rubella</a> from one of his children. This exposed both the prime and backup crews, who trained together. Mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had rubella as a child and thus was not immune. Three days before launch, at the insistence of the Flight Surgeon, Swigert was moved to the prime crew.

Mattingly never contracted rubella and was assigned after the mission as Command Module Pilot to Young's crew, which later flew <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a>, the fifth mission to land on the Moon.



The astronauts' mission insignia was sculpted as a medallion titled "Steeds of Apollo" by <a href="Lumen%20Martin%20Winter">Lumen Martin Winter</a> and was struck by the <a href="Franklin%20Mint">Franklin Mint</a>.

The Apollo 13 mission was to explore the <a href="Fra%20Mauro%20formation">Fra Mauro formation</a>, or Fra Mauro highlands, named after the diameter <a href="Fra%20Mauro%20crater">Fra Mauro crater</a> located within it. It is a widespread, hilly <a href="selenology">selenological</a> area thought to be composed of ejecta from the impact that formed <a href="Mare%20Imbrium">Mare Imbrium</a>.

The next Apollo mission, Apollo 14, eventually made a successful flight to Fra Mauro.

April 14, 1970 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> (April 13, 21:07:53 <a href="Central%20Standard%20Time%20%28North%20America%29">CST</a>)

April 15, 1970, 00:21:00 UTC; 

April 17, 1970, 18:07:41 UTC (142:54:47 Ground Elapsed Time). Crew was on board the <a href="USS%20Iwo%20Jima%20%28LPH-2%29">USS "Iwo Jima"</a> 45 minutes later.

The mission was launched at the planned time, 02:13:00 PM <a href="Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20%28North%20America%29">EST</a> (19:13:00 UTC) on April 11. An anomaly occurred when the second-stage, center (inboard) engine shut down about two minutes early. The four outboard engines and the third-stage engine burned longer to compensate, and the vehicle achieved very close to the planned circular <a href="parking%20orbit">parking orbit</a>, followed by a normal translunar injection about two hours later. The engine shutdown was determined to be caused by severe <a href="pogo%20oscillation">pogo oscillation</a>s measured at a strength of 68 "g" and a frequency of 16 hertz, flexing the thrust frame by . The vehicle's guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations. Pogo oscillations had been seen on previous Titan rockets, and also on the Saturn V during <a href="Apollo%206">Apollo 6</a>, but on Apollo 13, they were amplified by an unexpected interaction with turbopump <a href="cavitation">cavitation</a>. Later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development. These included addition of a helium-gas reservoir to the center engine <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> line to <a href="damping">damp</a> pressure oscillations, an automatic cutoff as a backup, and simplification of the propellant valves of all five second-stage engines.

The crew performed the separation and transposition maneuver to dock the Command Module "Odyssey" to the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) "Aquarius", and pulled away from the spent third stage, which ground controllers then sent on a course to impact the Moon in range of a seismometer placed on surface by <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>. They then settled in for the three-day trip to Fra Mauro.
Approaching 56 hours into the mission, Apollo 13 was approximately from Earth en route to the Moon. Approximately six and a half minutes after the end of a live TV broadcast from the spacecraft, Haise was in the process of closing out the LM, while Lovell was stowing the TV camera, and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Houston</a> flight controllers asked Swigert to turn on the hydrogen and oxygen tank stirring fans in the Service Module, which were designed to destratify the <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> contents and increase the accuracy of their quantity readings. Two minutes later, the astronauts heard a "pretty large bang," accompanied by fluctuations in electrical power and the firing of the attitude control thrusters. The crew initially thought that a <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a> might have struck the Lunar Module. Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8 seconds, until the system automatically corrected by switching the <a href="high%20gain%20antenna">high-gain</a> <a href="Unified%20S-band">S-band</a> antenna, used for translunar communications, from narrow-beam to wide-beam mode.
Immediately after the bang Swigert reported a "problem", which Lovell repeated and clarified as a "main B bus undervolt", a temporary loss of operating voltage on the second of the spacecraft's main electrical circuits. Oxygen tank 2 immediately read quantity zero. About three minutes later, the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells failed. Lovell reported seeing out the window that the craft was venting "a gas of some sort" into space. The number 1 oxygen tank quantity gradually reduced to zero over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.

Because the fuel cells generated the Command/Service Module's electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water, when oxygen tank 1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell finally shut down, leaving the craft on the Command Module's limited-duration battery power and water. The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save this for re-entry, and to power up the LM to use as a "lifeboat." This situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation, but had not been considered a likely scenario. Without the LM, the accident would certainly have been fatal.
The damage to the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director <a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a> ordered an abort of the mission. The existing abort plans, first drawn up in 1966, were evaluated; the quickest was a Direct Abort trajectory, which required using the Service Module Propulsion System (SPS) engine to achieve a <a href="delta-v">delta-v</a>. Although a successful SPS firing at 60 hours ground elapsed time (GET) would land the crew one day earlier (at 118 hours GET, or 58 hours later), the large delta-v was possible only if the LM were jettisoned first, and since crew survival depended on the LM's presence during the coast back to Earth, that option was "out of the question." An alternative would have been to burn the SPS fuel to depletion, then jettison the Service Module and make a second burn with the LM <a href="Descent%20Propulsion%20System">Descent Propulsion System</a> (DPS) engine. It was desired to keep the Service Module attached for as long as possible because of the thermal protection it afforded the Command Module's heat shield. Apollo 13 was close to entering the lunar <a href="sphere%20of%20influence%20%28astrodynamics%29">sphere of gravitational influence</a> (at 61 hours GET), which was the break-even point between direct and circumlunar aborts, and the latter allowed more time for evaluation and planning before a major rocket burn. There also was concern about "the structural integrity of the Service Module," so mission planners were instructed that the SPS engine would not be used "except as a last-ditch effort."

For these reasons, Kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option, using the Moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth. Apollo 13 had left its initial <a href="free-return%20trajectory">free-return trajectory</a> earlier in the mission, as required for the lunar landing at Fra Mauro. Therefore, the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-second burn of the DPS. The descent engine was used again two hours after <a href="pericynthion">pericynthion</a>, the closest approach to the Moon ("PC+2 burn"), to speed the return to Earth by 10 hours and move the landing spot from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A more aggressive burn could have been performed at PC+2 by first jettisoning the Service Module, returning the crew in about the same amount of time as a direct abort, but this was deemed unnecessary given the rates at which consumables were being used. The 4-minute, 24-second burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed.

Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew, <a href="flight%20controller">flight controller</a>s, and support personnel for the safe return. The developing drama was shown on television. Because electrical power was severely limited, no more live TV broadcasts were made; TV commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations. Low power levels made even voice communications difficult.

The Lunar Module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half, not three people for four days. Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface <a href="Extra-vehicular%20activity">EVA</a>. Unlike the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM), which was powered by fuel cells that produced water as a byproduct, the LM was powered by <a href="Silver-oxide%20battery">silver-zinc batteries</a>, so electrical power and water (used for equipment cooling as well as drinking) were critical consumables. To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until re-entry, the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible. In particular, the LM's <a href="Abort%20Guidance%20System">Abort Guidance System</a> was used for most of the coast back to Earth instead of the primary guidance system, as it used less power and water.

Availability of <a href="lithium%20hydroxide">lithium hydroxide</a> (LiOH) for <a href="carbon%20dioxide%20scrubber">removing carbon dioxide</a> presented a serious problem. The LM's internal stock of LiOH canisters was not sufficient to support the crew until return, and the remainder was stored in the descent stage, out of reach. The CM had an adequate supply of canisters, but these were incompatible with the LM. Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose. NASA engineers referred to the improvised device as "the mailbox".

Another problem to be solved for a safe return was accomplishing a complete power-up from scratch of the completely shut-down Command Module, something never intended to be done in-flight. Flight controller <a href="John%20Aaron">John Aaron</a>, with the support of grounded astronaut Mattingly and many engineers and designers, had to invent a new procedure to do this with the ship's limited power supply and time factor. This was further complicated by the fact that the reduced power levels in the LM caused internal temperatures to drop to as low as . The unpowered CM got so cold that water began to <a href="Condensation">condense</a> on solid surfaces, causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated. This turned out not to be a problem, partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> fire.

The last problem to be solved was how to separate the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's <a href="reaction%20control%20system">reaction control system</a> (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the engineering expertise of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist <a href="Bernard%20Etkin">Bernard Etkin</a>, was formed to solve the problem within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using <a href="slide%20rule">slide rule</a>s. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.

As Apollo 13 neared Earth, the crew first jettisoned the Service Module, using the LM's <a href="reaction%20control%20system">reaction control system</a> to pull themselves a safe distance from it, instead of the normal procedure which used automatic firing of the SM's RCS. They photographed it for later analysis of the accident's cause. It was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the entire Sector 4 panel had been blown off. According to the analysts, these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment.

Finally, the crew jettisoned the Lunar Module "Aquarius" using the above procedure worked out at the University of Toronto, leaving the Command Module "Odyssey" to begin its lone re-entry through the atmosphere. The re-entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the Command Module. The blackout in Apollo 13's reentry lasted six minutes, which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected. The possibility of heat-shield damage from the tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period.

"Odyssey" regained radio contact and splashed down safely in the South Pacific Ocean, , southeast of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a> and from the recovery ship, <a href="USS%20Iwo%20Jima%20%28LPH-2%29">USS "Iwo Jima"</a>.
The crew was in good condition except for Haise, who was suffering from a serious <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a> because of insufficient water intake. To avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft, the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps. A misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight.

The Lunar Module and Service Module reentered the atmosphere over the South Pacific between the islands of Fiji and New Zealand.

NASA Administrator <a href="Thomas%20O.%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a> and Deputy Administrator <a href="George%20Low">George Low</a> sent a memorandum to NASA <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a> Director <a href="Edgar%20Cortright">Edgar M. Cortright</a> on April 17, 1970, (date of spacecraft splashdown) advising him of his appointment as chairman of an Apollo 13 Review Board to investigate the cause of the accident.

The second memorandum to Cortright from Paine and Low on April 21 established the board as follows:

The board exhaustively investigated and analyzed the history of the manufacture and testing of the oxygen tank, and its installation and testing in the spacecraft up to the Apollo 13 launch, as documented in detailed records and logs. They visited and consulted with engineers at the contractor's sites and the Kennedy Space Center. Once a theory of the cause was developed, elements of it were tested, including on a test rig simulation in a vacuum chamber, with a damaged tank installed in the fuel cell bay. This test confirmed the theory when a similar explosion was created, which blew off the outer panel exactly as happened in the flight.
Cortright sent the final "Report of Apollo 13 Review Board" to Thomas Paine on June 15, 1970.

The failure started in the Service Module's number 2 oxygen tank. Damaged <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Teflon</a> insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside oxygen tank 2 allowed the wires to <a href="short%20circuit">short-circuit</a> and ignite this insulation. The resulting fire rapidly increased pressure beyond its limit and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (Sector 4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. It is also possible some combustion occurred of the <a href="Mylar">Mylar</a>/<a href="Kapton">Kapton</a> thermal insulation material used to line the oxygen shelf compartment in this bay.

The resulting pressure inside the compartment popped the bolts attaching the Sector 4 outer aluminum skin panel, which as it blew off probably caused minor damage to the nearby S-band antenna.

<a href="Shock%20%28mechanics%29">Mechanical shock</a> forced the oxygen valves closed on the number 1 and number 3 fuel cells, leaving them operating for only about three minutes on the oxygen in the feed lines. The shock also either partially ruptured a line from the number 1 oxygen tank, or caused its check or relief valve to leak, causing its contents to leak out into space over the next 130 minutes, entirely depleting the SM's oxygen supply.

The board determined the oxygen tank failure was caused by an unlikely chain of events. Tanks storing <a href="cryogen">cryogen</a>s, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, extremely good insulation, or both, in order to avoid excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks' contents. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain <a href="supercritical%20fluid">supercritical</a> hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water. The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible.

The tank contained several components relevant to the accident:

The heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the Command Module's 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. <a href="Beechcraft">Beechcraft</a>, the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage.

The oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the Apollo 10 Service Module, but was removed to fix a potential <a href="electromagnetic%20interference">electromagnetic interference</a> problem. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped about because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The tank appeared to be undamaged, but a loosely fitting filling tube was apparently damaged, and photographs suggested that the close-out cap on the top of the tank may have hit the fuel cell shelf. The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be "rather low."
After the tank was filled for ground testing, it could not be emptied through the normal drain line. To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank, the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen. Lovell signed off on this procedure. It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of . When the thermostat opened, the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered. The board confirmed by testing that the thermostats welded themselves closed under the higher voltage.
This raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated . A <a href="chart%20recorder">chart recorder</a> on the heater current showed that the heater was not cycling on and off, as it should have been if the thermostat was functioning correctly, but no one noticed it at the time. Because the temperature sensor was not designed to read higher than the thermostat opening temperature, the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank. The gas boiled off in hours rather than days.

The sustained high temperatures melted the <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Teflon</a> insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed. When the tank was refilled with oxygen, it became a bomb waiting to go off. During the "cryo stir" procedure, fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted, producing sparks and igniting the Teflon. This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it.
In June 1970, the Cortright Report provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices. It included a copy of established NASA procedures for alleviating high pressure in a cryogenic oxygen tank, to include:

This procedure was designed to prevent hardware failure so that the lunar landing mission could be continued. The "Mission Operations Report Apollo 13" recounts how the master caution and warning alarm had been turned off for a previous low-pressure reading on hydrogen tank 2, and so it did not trigger to call attention to the high oxygen pressure reading.

Oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission. Prior to the accident, the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours. This was done to get an earlier look at the pressure reading of the supercritical helium (SHe) tank in the LM descent stage, which had been suspect since before launch. After the abort decision, the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture. The helium tank <a href="burst%20disc">burst disc</a> ruptured at 108:54, after the lunar flyby. The expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control (PTC) roll (nicknamed the "barbecue roll").

While the investigation board did recreate the oxygen tank failure, it did not report on any experiments that would show how effective the Cryogenic Malfunctions Procedures were to prevent the system failure by de-energizing the electrical heater and fan circuits.

The oxygen tank was redesigned, with the thermostats upgraded to handle the proper voltage. The heaters were retained since they were necessary to maintain oxygen pressure. The stirring fans, with their unsealed motors, were removed, which meant the oxygen quantity gauge was no longer accurate. This required adding a third tank so that no tank would go below half full.

All electrical wiring in the power system bay was sheathed in stainless steel, and the oxygen quantity probes were changed from aluminum to stainless steel. The fuel cell oxygen supply valves were redesigned to isolate the Teflon-coated wiring from the oxygen. The spacecraft and Mission Control monitoring systems were modified to give more immediate and visible warnings of anomalies.

Because Apollo 13 followed the <a href="free-return%20trajectory">free-return trajectory</a>, its altitude over the <a href="Far%20side%20%28Moon%29">lunar far side</a> was approximately greater than the orbital altitude on the remaining Apollo lunar missions. The Moon was almost at <a href="apogee">apogee</a> during the mission (as it also was during the flights of Apollo 10 and Apollo 15), which also increased the distance from the Earth. The combination of the two effects ensures that Apollo 13 holds the absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft, reaching a distance of from Earth on 7:21 pm EST, April 14, 1970.

The <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">A7L</a> spacesuit intended to be worn on the lunar surface by Lovell would have been the first to feature red bands on the arms, legs, lunar EVA helmet assembly, and the life-support backpack. This came about because Mission Control personnel watching the video feeds of Apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down. The red bands were used for the remaining Apollo flights, the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle program</a>, and in the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

The Apollo 13 mission was called "a successful failure" by Lovell, because of the successful safe return of the astronauts, but the failed lunar landing. Lead <a href="Flight%20Director">Flight Director</a> <a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a> and
<a href="Electrical%2C%20Environmental%2C%20Consumables%20Manager">Flight controller</a> <a href="Sy%20Liebergot">Sy Liebergot</a>, the first one to see the telemetry of the initial oxygen tank failure, both describe it decades later as "NASA's finest hour."

President Nixon awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> to the crew and the <a href="Apollo%2013%20Mission%20Operations%20Team">Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team</a> for their actions during the mission.

The Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment (CCGE) which was part of the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiment%20Package">ALSEP</a> on Apollo 13 was never flown again. It was a version of the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge (CCIG) which featured on Apollo 12, Apollo 14, and <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a>. The CCGE was designed as a standalone version of the CCIG. On other missions, the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector (SIDE). Because of the aborted landing, this experiment was never deployed. Other experiments included on Apollo 13's ALSEP included the Heat Flow Experiment (HFE), the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), and the Charged Particle Lunar Environment Experiment (CPLEE).

The original <a href="lunar%20plaque">lunar plaque</a> affixed to the front landing leg of "Aquarius" bore Mattingly’s name, so a replacement plaque with Swigert’s name was carried in the cabin, for Lovell to place over the other after he descended the ladder. He kept the plaque as a souvenir. In his book "<a href="Lost%20Moon">Lost Moon</a>" (later renamed "Apollo 13"), Lovell stated that, apart from the plaque and a couple of other pieces, the only other memento he possesses is a letter from <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a>.

The Apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as Apollo's "chariot" across space. Given Lovell's Navy background, the logo also included the mottoes ""Ex Luna, scientia"" ("From the Moon, knowledge"), borrowed from the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a>'s motto, ""Ex scientia tridens"" ("From knowledge, sea power"). The mission number appeared in <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a> as Apollo XIII. The patch did not have to be modified after Mattingly's replacement since it is one of only two Apollo mission insignia—the other being Apollo 11—not to include the names of the crew. It was designed by artist <a href="Lumen%20Martin%20Winter">Lumen Martin Winter</a>, who based it on a mural he had done for <a href="The%20St.%20Regis%20Hotel">The St. Regis Hotel</a> in New York City. The mural was later purchased by actor <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, who portrayed Lovell in the movie "<a href="Apollo%2013%20%28film%29">Apollo 13</a>", and now is on the wall of a restaurant near Chicago owned by Lovell's son.

Despite Apollo 13's failure to land on the Moon, several experiments were conducted successfully because they were initiated before or conducted independently of the oxygen tank explosion.

As a joke following Apollo 13's successful splashdown, <a href="Grumman%20Aerospace%20Corporation">Grumman Aerospace Corporation</a> pilot Sam Greenberg (who had helped with the strategy for re-routing power from the LM to the crippled CM) issued a tongue-in-cheek invoice for $400,540.05 to <a href="Rockwell%20International">North American Rockwell</a>, <a href="Pratt%20and%20Whitney">Pratt and Whitney</a>, and <a href="Beech%20Aircraft">Beech Aircraft</a>, prime and subcontractors for the CSM, for "towing" the crippled ship most of the way to the Moon and back. The figure was based on an estimated at $1.00 per mile, plus $4.00 for the first mile. An extra $536.05 was included for battery charging, oxygen, and an "additional guest in room" (Swigert). A 20% "commercial discount," as well as a further 2% discount if North American were to pay in cash, reduced the total to $312,421.24. North American declined payment, noting that it had ferried three previous Grumman LMs to the Moon (Apollo 10, Apollo 11 and Apollo 12) with no such reciprocal charges.

The Command Module shell was formerly at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27Air%20et%20de%20l%27Espace">Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace</a>, in Paris. The interior components were removed during the investigation of the accident and reassembled into <a href="Boilerplate%20%28spaceflight%29%23Apollo%20boilerplates">boilerplate</a> BP-1102A, the water egress training module; and were subsequently on display at the <a href="Kentucky%20Science%20Center">Museum of Natural History and Science</a> in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, until 2000. The Command Module and the internal components were reassembled, and "Odyssey" is currently on display at the <a href="Cosmosphere">Cosmosphere</a> in <a href="Hutchinson%2C%20Kansas">Hutchinson, Kansas</a>.

The Lunar Module burned up in Earth's atmosphere on April 17, 1970, having been targeted to enter over the Pacific Ocean to reduce the possibility of contamination from a <a href="Systems%20Nuclear%20Auxiliary%20Power%20Program">SNAP 27</a> <a href="radioisotope%20thermoelectric%20generator">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a> (RTG) on board. Intended to power the mission's <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">ALSEP</a>, the RTG survived re-entry (as designed) and landed in the <a href="Tonga%20Trench">Tonga Trench</a>. While it will remain radioactive for several thousand years, it does not appear to be releasing any of its 3.9 kg of radioactive <a href="plutonium-238">plutonium-238</a>.

Lovell's lunar space suit helmet, one of his gloves, and the plaque that had been intended to be left on the Moon are on exhibit at the <a href="Adler%20Planetarium">Adler Planetarium</a> in Chicago, Illinois.

The Apollo 13 <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> with its Instrument Unit was guided to <a href="List%20of%20man-made%20objects%20on%20the%20Moon">crash onto the lunar surface</a> on April 14, providing a signal for the <a href="Apollo%2012%20Passive%20Seismic%20Experiment">Apollo 12 Passive Seismic Experiment</a>.

The 1974 movie "<a href="Houston%2C%20We%27ve%20Got%20a%20Problem">Houston, We've Got a Problem</a>", while set around the Apollo 13 incident, is a fictional drama about the crises faced by ground personnel when the emergency disrupts their work schedules and places additional stress on their lives; only a couple of news clips and a narrator's solemn voice deal with the actual problems. "Houston... We've Got a Problem" was also the title of an episode of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary series "A Life At Stake", broadcast in March 1978. This was an accurate, if simplified, reconstruction of the events.

Lovell was approached in 1991 by journalist <a href="Jeffrey%20Kluger">Jeffrey Kluger</a> about collaborating on a non-fiction account of the mission. The resultant book, "<a href="Lost%20Moon">Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13</a>", was published in 1994. The next year, a film adaptation of the book, "<a href="Apollo%2013%20%28film%29">Apollo 13</a>", was released, directed by <a href="Ron%20Howard">Ron Howard</a> and starring <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> as Lovell, <a href="Bill%20Paxton">Bill Paxton</a> as Haise, <a href="Kevin%20Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a> as Swigert, <a href="Gary%20Sinise">Gary Sinise</a> as Mattingly, <a href="Ed%20Harris">Ed Harris</a> as <a href="flight%20controller%23Flight%20Director%20%28FLIGHT%29">flight director</a> <a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a>, and <a href="Kathleen%20Quinlan">Kathleen Quinlan</a> as Marilyn Lovell. James Lovell, Eugene Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some <a href="dramatic%20license">dramatic license</a> was taken. For example, the film changes the tense of Lovell's famous follow-up to Swigert's original words from, "Houston, we've had a problem", to "Houston, we "have" a problem". The film was nominated for several Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Harris) and Best Supporting Actress (Quinlan).

In the 1998 miniseries "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">From the Earth to the Moon</a>", co-produced by Hanks and Howard, the mission is dramatized in the episode "We Interrupt This Program". Rather than showing the incident from the crew's perspective as in the "Apollo 13" feature film, it is instead presented from an Earth-bound perspective of television reporters competing for coverage of the event.

In 2008, an interactive theatrical show titled "" premiered at <a href="BATS%20Theatre">BATS Theatre</a> in Wellington, New Zealand. The production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline. The show also featured a 'guest' astronaut each night: a member of the public who suited up and amongst other duties, stirred the oxygen tanks and said the line "Houston, we've had a problem." This 'replacement' astronaut was a nod to Jack Swigert, who replaced Ken Mattingly shortly before the launch in 1970. The production toured to other cities extensively in New Zealand and Australia in 2010–2011. The production was scheduled to travel to the US in 2012.

In the "<a href="DC%27s%20Legends%20of%20Tomorrow">DC's Legends of Tomorrow</a>" episode 'Moonshot,' the oxygen tank explosion is averted when <a href="Eobard%20Thawne">Eobard Thawne</a> disguises himself as Swigert, in order to retrieve a piece of the Spear of Destiny that was hidden in the pole section of the American flag planted on July 21, 1969. Thawne and <a href="Atom%20%28Ray%20Palmer%29">Ray Palmer</a> crash land the lander on the Moon's surface.

In November 2011, a notebook containing a checklist Lovell used to calculate a trajectory to get the damaged spacecraft, Apollo 13, back to Earth, and handwritten calculations by Lovell, was auctioned off by <a href="Heritage%20Auctions">Heritage Auctions</a> for $388,375. NASA made an email inquiry asking Heritage if Lovell had clear title to the notebook, stating that NASA had "nothing to indicate" the agency had ever transferred ownership of the checklist to Lovell. In January 2012, Heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after NASA launched an investigation into whether it was the astronaut’s property to sell.

Apollo 7

Apollo 7 was an October 1968 <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> mission carried out by the United States. It was the first mission in the United States' <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a> to carry a crew into space. It was also the first U.S. spaceflight to carry astronauts since the flight of <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini XII</a> in November 1966. The <a href="Apollo%201">AS-204 mission</a>, also known as "Apollo 1", was intended to be the first manned flight of the Apollo program. It was scheduled to launch in February 1967, but a <a href="Apollo%201%23Accident">fire</a> in the cabin during a January 1967 test killed the crew. Manned flights were then suspended for 21 months, while the cause of the accident was investigated and improvements made to the spacecraft and safety procedures, and unmanned test flights of the <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket and <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a> were made. Apollo 7 fulfilled Apollo 1's mission of testing the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>.

The Apollo 7 crew was commanded by <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Walter M. Schirra</a>, with senior pilot / navigator <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn F. Eisele</a>, and pilot / systems engineer <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">R. Walter Cunningham</a>. Official crew titles were made consistent with those that would be used for the manned lunar landing missions: Eisele was "Command Module Pilot" and Cunningham was "Lunar Module Pilot". Their mission was <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">Apollo's 'C' mission</a>, an 11-day Earth-orbital test flight to check out the redesigned Block II CSM with a crew on board. It was the first time a <a href="Saturn%20IB">Saturn IB</a> vehicle put a crew into space; Apollo 7 was the first three-person American space mission, and the first to include a live TV broadcast from an American spacecraft. It was launched on October 11, 1968, from what was then known as <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station">Cape Kennedy Air Force Station</a>, Florida. Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a complete technical success, giving <a href="NASA">NASA</a> the confidence to send <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> into orbit around the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> two months later. The flight would prove to be the final space flight for all of its three crew members—and the only one for both Cunningham and Eisele—when it splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on October 22, 1968. It was also the only <a href="Human%20spaceflight">manned launch</a> from <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Space%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Launch Complex 34</a>, as well as the last launch from the complex.


Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were first named as an Apollo crew on September 29, 1966. They were to fly a second Earth orbital test of the original Block I Command/Service module (not designed to dock with the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a> for lunar flight) after <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a>, the first manned flight, to be made by <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Virgil "Gus" Grissom</a>, <a href="Edward%20Higgins%20White">Edward H. White</a>, and <a href="Roger%20Chaffee">Roger Chaffee</a>. In December 1966, the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled, and Schirra's crew were reassigned as Grissom's backup.

Plans for the first manned Apollo flights were completely disrupted by the January 27, 1967 cabin fire which killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee. Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first manned flight, which would now use the Block II spacecraft designed for the lunar missions. The <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> (CM) and astronauts' spacesuits had been extensively redesigned, to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew. Schirra thus became the only astronaut to fly <a href="Project%20Mercury">Mercury</a>, <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini</a> and Apollo missions. His crew would test the life support, propulsion, guidance and control systems during this "open-ended" mission (meaning it would be extended as it passed each test). The duration was limited to 11 days, reduced from the original 14-day limit for Apollo 1. Since it flew in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> and did not include the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM), Apollo 7 was launched with the Saturn IB booster rather than the much larger and more powerful <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a>.

Throughout the Mercury and Gemini programs, <a href="McDonnell%20Aircraft">McDonnell Aircraft</a> engineer <a href="Guenter%20Wendt">Guenter Wendt</a> had been leader of the spacecraft launch pad teams, with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch. He earned the astronauts' respect and admiration, including Schirra's. However, the spacecraft contractor had changed from McDonnell (Mercury & Gemini) to <a href="Rockwell%20International">North American Rockwell</a> (Apollo), so Wendt was not the pad leader for Apollo 1.

So adamant was Schirra in his desire to have Wendt back as Pad Leader for his Apollo flight, that he got his boss <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> to persuade North American management to hire Wendt away from McDonnell, and Schirra personally lobbied North American's launch operations manager to change Wendt's shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for Apollo 7. Wendt remained as Pad Leader for the entire Apollo program.

Wendt's face was the last they saw before the hatch was sealed, and immediately after liftoff Eisele said with a mock German accent into his radio, "I vonder vere Guenter Vendt?"

The first manned American space flight in 22 months lifted from LC-34 at 15:02:45 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on Friday, October 11, 1968. Liftoff proceeded flawlessly; the Saturn IB performed well on its first manned launch and there were no significant anomalies during the boost phase. The astronauts described it as very smooth riding compared to the rough, bumpy Titan II used to launch the <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini</a> spacecraft.

Following orbital injection and separation from the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a>, the crew turned the CSM around using its <a href="Reaction%20control%20system">Reaction Control System</a> thrusters, and Eisele practiced a simulated Lunar Module rendezvous and docking, using a visual reference target mounted inside the spacecraft adapter in the same radial position it occupied on the LM. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding <a href="Flight%20controller%23Capsule%20Communicator%20%28CAPCOM%29">CAPCOM</a> <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Stafford">Tom Stafford</a> of his "angry alligator" experience on <a href="Gemini%209A">Gemini 9A</a>, when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts might have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.

The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Propulsion%20System">Service Propulsion System</a> (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight firings, performing within 1% of the engine acceptance test thrust and <a href="specific%20impulse">specific impulse</a> values. As the Saturn IB itself had performed very smoothly during launch, the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the SPS, leading to Schirra yelling "Yabbadabbadoo!" in reference to "<a href="The%20Flintstones">The Flintstones</a>" cartoon. Don Eisele called it "a real boot in the rear."

An assortment of minor hardware problems occurred over the flight; these included the drinking water hose trigger sticking during the final two days, a momentary undervoltage of the main AC buses caused by the automatic cryo fan switch in the service module LOX and LH2 tanks, and a loss of telemetry due to a malfunctioning electrical commutator following SM jettison at the end of the mission, meaning that the final 15 minutes of data transmission were lost. Aside from the last event, which remained a mystery despite postflight testing of the commutator, all of the problems on Apollo 7 were quickly resolved and some of them also involved equipment or procedures that would not be used on subsequent missions.

Apollo promised the best food preparation yet seen on a manned spacecraft. For the first time, astronauts had both hot and cold water to prepare meals with (the food came in freeze-dried vacuum packs that would be injected with water or else eaten dry followed by a sip of water) and Wally Schirra, who had had only toothpaste-like tubes for food on his <a href="Mercury-Atlas%208">Mercury flight</a>, described the food as "Still does not match home cooking, but it comes a lot closer than space food used to." Thirty-three meals were provided for the three crewmen, allowing them three meals a day for each of the 11 days in space. Even so, the astronauts complained that there was more food than they could eat and that most of it was too sweet, although the menus had been prepared based on their personal preferences.

Early fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was "incredibly easy" with no gravity to work against. As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful, an exercise device called the Exer-Genie was provided.

Another mission goal was the first <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">live television</a> <a href="broadcasting">broadcast</a> from an American spacecraft (<a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a> had transmitted <a href="Slow-scan%20television">slow scan television</a> pictures from <a href="Mercury-Atlas%209">"Faith 7"</a> in 1963, which were never broadcast). It was initially scheduled for midday on day two, but Schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the <a href="Space%20rendezvous">rendezvous</a> test.

Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less-than-ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew <a href="motion%20sickness">motion sickness</a>, which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew were unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe <a href="Common%20cold">head cold</a>. As a result, he became irritable with requests from <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center%23Gemini%20and%20Apollo%20%281965-1975%29">Mission Control</a> and all three astronauts began "talking back" to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:
SCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.
CAPCOM (<a href="Jack%20Swigert">Jack Swigert</a>): Roger. Copy.
SCHIRRA: Roger.
CAPCOM 1 (<a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.
SCHIRRA: Roger.
CAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. 
SCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7
CAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.
SCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.
A further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to <a href="Valsalva%20maneuver">pinch their noses and blow</a> to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous "fishbowl" type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:

CAPCOM Number 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand that there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. 
SCHIRRA: And there is no experience with the helmet either on that one. 
CAPCOM: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. 
SCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. 
CAPCOM: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. 
SCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. 
CAPCOM: Yes. 
SCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. 
CAPCOM: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less
about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. 
SCHIRRA: Thank you, babe. 
CAPCOM: Over and out.
Exchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions (Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA). If Apollo 7 was a mutiny, the <a href="Skylab%20mutiny">Skylab mutiny</a> could be compared to a full-blown rebellion, alternatively some have downplayed these as "strikes" or workplace tension, or simply the intricacies of working out the spaceflight workplace and planning environment. After Skylab, those "mutineer" astronauts did not fly again either, but neither did the most of the other astronauts in the <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> program. NASA did not do another long duration space-flight of more than a couple weeks or so for over 25 years (see <a href="Shuttle%E2%80%93Mir%20Program">Shuttle–Mir Program</a>)

The <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a> point was , SSW of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and north of the recovery ship <a href="USS%20Essex%20%28CV-9%29">USS "Essex"</a>.

Despite the difficulties between the crew and Mission Control, the mission successfully met its objectives to verify the Apollo Command and Service Modules' flight worthiness, allowing Apollo 8's flight to the Moon to proceed just two months later. Apollo 7 was Project Apollo's only human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station's <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Launch Complex 34</a>. All subsequent Apollo and <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> spacecraft flights (including <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz</a>) were launched from <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a> at the nearby <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>. Launch Complex 34 was declared redundant and decommissioned in 1969, making Apollo 7 the last human spaceflight mission to launch from the Cape Air Force Station in the 20th century. As of January 2017, Cunningham is the only surviving member of the crew. Eisele died in 1987 and Schirra in 2007.

The insignia for the flight shows a Command and Service module with its SPS engine firing, the trail from that fire encircling a globe and extending past the edges of the patch symbolizing the Earth-orbital nature of the mission. The <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numeral</a> VII appears in the South <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and the crew's names appear on a wide black arc at the bottom. The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a>.

After the mission, NASA awarded Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham its <a href="NASA%20Exceptional%20Service%20Medal">Exceptional Service Medal</a> in recognition of their success. On November 2, 1968, President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> held a ceremony at the <a href="LBJ%20Ranch">LBJ Ranch</a> in Johnson City, Texas, to present the astronauts with the medals. He also presented NASA's highest honor, the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Distinguished Service Medal</a>, to recently retired NASA administrator James E. Webb, for his "outstanding leadership of America's space program" since the beginning of Apollo.

Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were the only crew, of all the Apollo, <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a>, and <a href="Apollo-Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a> missions, who had not been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal immediately following their missions (though Schirra had received the medal twice before, for his Mercury and Gemini missions). Therefore, NASA administrator <a href="Michael%20D.%20Griffin">Michael D. Griffin</a> decided to belatedly award the medals to the crew in October 2008, "[f]or exemplary performance in meeting all the Apollo 7 mission objectives and more on the first manned Apollo mission, paving the way for the first flight to the Moon on Apollo 8 and the first manned lunar landing on Apollo 11." Only Cunningham was still alive at the time; Eisele's widow accepted his medal, and <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> crew member <a href="Bill%20Anders">Bill Anders</a> accepted Schirra's. Other Apollo astronauts, including <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>, <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Bean">Alan Bean</a>, were present at the award ceremony. Former <a href="Flight%20controller%23Flight%20Director%20%28FLIGHT%29">Flight Director</a> <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%2C%20Jr.">Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.</a>, who had been in conflict with the crew during the mission, sent a conciliatory video message of congratulations, saying: "We gave you a hard time once but you certainly survived that and have done extremely well since ... I am frankly, very proud to call you a friend."

In January 1969, the Apollo 7 Command Module was displayed on a NASA float in the inauguration parade of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a>. For nearly 30 years the Command Module was on loan (renewable every two years) to the <a href="Canada%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Museum">National Museum of Science and Technology</a>, in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, along with the space suit worn by <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>. In November 2003, the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, D.C., requested them back for display at their new annex at the <a href="Steven%20F.%20Udvar-Hazy%20Center">Steven F.

On November 6, 1968, comedian <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> broadcast one of his <a href="variety%20show">variety</a> <a href="television%20special">television special</a>s from NASA's <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> in Houston to honor the Apollo 7 crew. Barbara Eden, star of the popular <a href="sitcom">comedy series</a> "<a href="I%20Dream%20of%20Jeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a>", which featured two fictional astronauts among its regular characters, appeared with Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham.

Schirra parlayed the head cold he contracted during Apollo 7 into a television advertising contract as a spokesman for <a href="Actifed">Actifed</a>, an <a href="over-the-counter%20drug">over the counter</a> version of the medicine he took in space.

The Apollo 7 mission is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries <a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">"From the Earth to the Moon"</a> episode "We Have Cleared the Tower", with <a href="Mark%20Harmon">Mark Harmon</a> as Schirra, John Mese as Eisele, <a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Fredric Lehne</a> as Cunningham, and <a href="Max%20Wright">Max Wright</a> as Wendt.

Apollo 9

Apollo 9 was the third manned mission in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo space program</a> and the first flight of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) with the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM, pronounced "lem"). Its three-person crew, consisting of Commander <a href="James%20McDivitt">James McDivitt</a>, Command Module Pilot <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a>, and Lunar Module Pilot <a href="Rusty%20Schweickart">Rusty Schweickart</a>, spent ten days in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> testing several aspects critical to landing on the Moon, including the LM engines, backpack life support systems, navigation systems, and docking maneuvers. The mission was the second manned launch of a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> <a href="rocket">rocket</a>.

After launching on March 3, 1969, the crewmen performed the first manned flight of a LM, the first docking and extraction of a LM, two <a href="Extra-vehicular%20activity">spacewalks</a> (EVA), and the second docking of two manned <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>—two months after the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviets</a> performed a spacewalk crew transfer between <a href="Soyuz%204">Soyuz 4</a> and <a href="Soyuz%205">Soyuz 5</a>. The mission proved the LM worthy of manned spaceflight. Further tests on the <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a> mission would prepare the LM for its ultimate goal, landing on the Moon. They returned to Earth on March 13, 1969.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Williams was killed in October 1967 when the <a href="Northrop%20T-38%20Talon">T-38</a> he was flying crashed near <a href="Tallahassee">Tallahassee</a>, and was replaced with <a href="Alan%20Bean">Alan L. Bean</a>.






In April 1966, McDivitt, Scott, and Schweickart were selected by Deke Slayton as the second Apollo crew, as backup to <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, <a href="Edward%20Higgins%20White">Ed White</a>, and <a href="Roger%20Chaffee">Roger Chaffee</a> for the first manned Earth orbital test flight of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Development%20history">block I Command/Service Module</a>, designated <a href="Apollo%201">AS-204</a> expected to fly in late 1966. This was to be followed by a second block I flight, AS-205, to be crewed by <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn Eisele</a>, and
<a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a>. The third manned mission, designated AS-207/208, was planned to fly the block II Command Module and the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> in Earth orbit, launched on separate <a href="Saturn%20IB">Saturn IB</a>s, with a crew to be named.

However, delays in the block I CSM development pushed AS-204 into 1967. By December 1966, the original AS-205 mission was cancelled, Schirra's crew was named as Grissom's backup, and McDivitt's crew was promoted to prime crew for the LM test mission, re-designated AS-205/208. On January 26, 1967, they were training for this flight, expected to occur in late 1967, in the first block II Command Module 101 at the <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American</a> plant in <a href="Downey%2C%20California">Downey, California</a>.
The next day, Grissom's crew were conducting a launch-pad test for their planned February 21 mission, which they named <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a>, when a fire broke out in the cabin, killing all three men and putting an 18-month hold on the manned program while the block II <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> (CM) and <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">A7L pressure suit</a> were redesigned for safety.

As it turned out, a 1967 launch of AS-205/208 would have been impossible even absent the Apollo 1 accident, as problems with the LM delayed its first unmanned test flight until January 1968. NASA was able to use the 18-month hiatus to catch up with development and unmanned testing of the LM and the Saturn V launch vehicle.

By October 1967, planning for manned flights resumed, with <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> being the first Earth orbit CSM flight (now known as the C mission) in October 1968 given to Schirra's crew, and McDivitt's mission (now known as the D Mission) following as Apollo 8 in December 1968, using a single Saturn V instead of the two Saturn IBs. This would be followed by a higher Earth orbit flight (E Mission), to be crewed by <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>, <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a>, and <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a> in early 1969.

However, LM problems again prevented it from being ready for the D mission by December, so NASA officials created another mission for <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> using the Saturn V to launch only the CSM on the first manned flight to orbit the Moon, and the E mission was cancelled as unnecessary. Slayton asked McDivitt and Borman which mission they preferred to fly; McDivitt wanted to fly the LM, while Borman volunteered for the pioneering lunar flight. Therefore, Slayton swapped the crews, and McDivitt's crew flew Apollo 9.

The crew swap also affected who would be the first crew to land on the Moon; when the crews for Apollo 8 and 9 were swapped, their backup crews were also swapped. Since the rule of thumb was for backup crews to fly as prime crew three missions later, this put <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a>'s crew (Borman's backup) in position for the first landing mission <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> instead of <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Pete Conrad</a>'s crew, who made the second landing on <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>.

Apollo 9 was the first space test of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the third critical piece of Apollo hardware besides the Command/Service Module and the Saturn V launch vehicle—the Lunar Module. It was also the first <a href="space%20rendezvous">space docking</a> of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them. For ten days, the astronauts put both Apollo spacecraft through their paces in Earth orbit, including an undocking and redocking of the lunar lander with the command vehicle, just as the landing mission crew would perform in lunar orbit. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task, on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend.

For this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft (the last spacecraft to have been named was <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a>). The gangly LM was named "Spider", and the CSM was labeled "Gumdrop" because of the Command Module's shape, and because of the blue wrapping in which the craft arrived at <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>. These names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently.

Schweickart and Scott performed an EVA—Schweickart checked out the new <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">Apollo spacesuit</a>, the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft, while Scott filmed him from the Command Module hatch. Schweickart was due to carry out a more extensive set of activities to test the suit, and demonstrate that it was possible for astronauts to perform an EVA from the Lunar Module to the Command Module in an emergency, but as he had been suffering from <a href="Space%20adaptation%20syndrome">space sickness</a> the extra tests were scratched.

McDivitt and Schweickart later test-flew the LM, and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in Earth orbit. They flew the LM up to from "Gumdrop", using the engine on the descent stage to propel them originally, before jettisoning it and using the ascent stage to return. This test flight represented the first flight of a manned spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.

The splashdown point was 23°15′N, 67°56′W, east of <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> and within sight of the recovery ship <a href="USS%20Guadalcanal%20%28LPH-7%29">USS "Guadalcanal"</a>. Apollo 9 was the last spacecraft to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Command Module was displayed at the Michigan Space and Science Center, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson, Michigan</a>, until April 2004 when the center closed. In May 2004, it was moved to the <a href="San%20Diego%20Air%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Museum">San Diego Aerospace Museum</a> (now named the San Diego Air & Space Museum). The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on October 23, 1981, the LM descent stage (1969-018D) orbit decayed March 22, 1969. The <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> stage <a href="J-2%20%28rocket%20engine%29">J-2</a> engine was restarted after Lunar Module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion.

The <a href="S-IVB">Saturn IVB</a> <a href="third%20stage">third stage</a> became a <a href="space%20debris">object</a> where it would continue to <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">orbit the Sun</a> for many years. , it remains in orbit.

The circular patch shows a drawing of a Saturn V rocket with the letters USA on it. To its right, an Apollo CSM is shown next to an LM, with the CSM's nose pointed at the "front door" of the LM rather than at its top docking port. The CSM is trailing rocket fire in a circle. The crew's names are along the top edge of the circle, with APOLLO <a href="Roman%20numerals">IX</a> at the bottom. The "D" in McDivitt's name is filled with red to mark that this was the "D mission" in the alphabetic sequence of Apollo missions. The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a>.

The Apollo 9 Command Module "Gumdrop" (1969-018A) is on display at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Air%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Museum">San Diego Air & Space Museum</a>, <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego, California</a>. Its <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) was jettisoned shortly after the deorbit burn and <a href="atmospheric%20entry">re-entered</a> the atmosphere.

The ascent stage of LM-3 "Spider" (1969-018C) re-entered on October 23, 1981.

The descent stage of LM-3 "Spider" (1969-018D) re-entered on March 22, 1969.

The upper stage of the Apollo 9 Saturn V, S-IVB-504N, (1969-018B) remains in <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">heliocentric</a> (solar) orbit .

Arthritis

Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects <a href="joints">joints</a>. Symptoms generally include <a href="joint%20pain">joint pain</a> and stiffness. Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, <a href="joint%20effusion">swelling</a>, and decreased <a href="range%20of%20motion">range of motion</a> of the affected joints. In some types other organs are also affected. Onset can be gradual or sudden.
There are over 100 types of arthritis. The most common forms are <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> (degenerative joint disease) and <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips. Rheumatoid arthritis is an <a href="autoimmune%20disorder">autoimmune disorder</a> that often affects the hands and feet. Other types include <a href="gout">gout</a>, <a href="lupus">lupus</a>, <a href="fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a>, and <a href="septic%20arthritis">septic arthritis</a>. They are all types of <a href="rheumatic%20disease">rheumatic disease</a>.
Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat. Weight loss and exercise may also be useful. Pain medications such as <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="paracetamol">paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) may be used. In some a <a href="joint%20replacement">joint replacement</a> may be useful.
Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> population at some point in their lives. In Australia about 15% of people are affected, while in the United States more than 20% have a type of arthritis. Overall the disease becomes more common with age. Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life. The term is from Greek "arthro-" meaning joint and "-itis" meaning <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>.

There are several diseases where joint pain is primary, and is considered the main feature. Generally when a person has "arthritis" it means that they have one of these diseases, which include:

Joint pain can also be a symptom of other diseases. In this case, the arthritis is considered to be secondary to the main disease; these include:
An "undifferentiated arthritis" is an arthritis that does not fit into well-known clinical disease categories, possibly being an early stage of a definite <a href="rheumatic%20disease">rheumatic disease</a>.

Pain, which can vary in severity, is a common symptom in virtually all types of arthritis. Other symptoms include <a href="swelling%20%28medical%29">swelling</a>, <a href="joint%20stiffness">joint stiffness</a> and aching around the joint(s). Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can affect other organs in the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. Symptoms may include:


It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur. For example, arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise, which can lead to secondary effects, such as:
These changes, in addition to the primary symptoms, can have a huge impact on quality of life.

Arthritis is the most common cause of <a href="disability">disability</a> in the USA. More than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis. <a href="Absenteeism">Absenteeism</a> and frequent visits to the <a href="physician">physician</a> are common in individuals who have arthritis. Arthritis can make it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and some become home bound.

It is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to $100 billion of which almost 50% is from lost earnings. Each year, arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to <a href="health%20care">health care</a> centers.

Decreased mobility, in combination with the above symptoms, can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active, contributing to an increased risk of obesity, high <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> or vulnerability to <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>. People with arthritis are also at increased risk of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, which may be a response to numerous factors, including fear of worsening symptoms.

Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. All arthritides potentially feature <a href="pain">pain</a>. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. <a href="Rheumatoid%20arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</a> is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness; in the early stages, patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower. <a href="Osteoarthritis">Osteoarthritis</a>, on the other hand, tends to be worse after exercise. In the aged and children, pain might not be the main presenting feature; the aged patient simply moves less, the infantile patient refuses to use the affected limb.

Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity.

<a href="Blood%20test">Blood test</a>s and <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: <a href="rheumatoid%20factor">rheumatoid factor</a>, <a href="antinuclear%20factor">antinuclear factor</a> (ANF), <a href="extractable%20nuclear%20antigen">extractable nuclear antigen</a>, and specific antibodies.

<a href="Osteoarthritis">Osteoarthritis</a> is the most common form of arthritis. It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body, including the hands, <a href="wrist%20osteoarthritis">wrists</a>, feet, back, hip, and knee. The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint; however, osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury. In recent years, some joint or limb deformities, such as knock-knee or acetabular overcoverage or dysplasia, have also been considered as a predisposing factor for knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other. The condition starts with minor pain during physical activity, but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest. The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities. Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints, such as the back, knee and hip. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65. Risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.

<a href="Rheumatoid%20arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</a> (RA) is a disorder in which the body's own immune system starts to attack body <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a>. The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body. In rheumatoid arthritis, most damage occurs to the joint lining and <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones. RA often affects joints in the fingers, wrists, knees and elbows, is symmetrical (appears on both sides of the body), and can lead to severe <a href="deformity">deformity</a> in a few years if not treated. RA occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above. In children, the disorder can present with a skin <a href="rash">rash</a>, <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="pain">pain</a>, disability, and limitations in daily activities. With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment, many individuals can lead a better quality of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. The drugs to treat RA range from <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a>s to <a href="monoclonal%20antibodies">monoclonal antibodies</a> given <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">intravenously</a>. Treatments also include analgesics such as <a href="Nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">NSAID</a>s and <a href="disease-modifying%20antirheumatic%20drug">disease-modifying antirheumatic drug</a>s (DMARDs), while in rare cases, surgery may be required to replace joints, but there is no cure for the disease.

Treatment with DMARDs is designed to initiate an <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune response</a>, in part by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells, specifically Th17 cells. Th17 cells are present in higher quantities at the site of bone destruction in joints and produce inflammatory cytokines associated with inflammation, such as interleukin-17 (IL-17).

Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Bone continuously undergoes remodeling by actions of bone resorbing <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s and bone forming <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the <a href="synovium">synovium</a>, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Osteoclast activity can be directly induced by osteoblasts through the RANK/RANKL mechanism.

<a href="Lupus%20erythematosus">Lupus</a> is a common <a href="collagen">collagen</a> <a href="vascular">vascular</a> disorder that can be present with severe arthritis. Other features of lupus include a skin rash, extreme <a href="photosensitivity">photosensitivity</a>, <a href="baldness">hair loss</a>, <a href="kidney">kidney</a> problems, lung fibrosis and constant joint pain.

<a href="Gout">Gout</a> is caused by deposition of <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> crystals in the joint, causing inflammation. There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as <a href="Calcium%20pyrophosphate%20deposition%20disease">pseudogout</a>. In the early stages, the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint, but with time, it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling. The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function. Gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout cannot successfully be treated. When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g., probenecid), this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout or RCG.

<a href="Infectious%20arthritis">Infectious arthritis</a> is another severe form of arthritis. It presents with sudden onset of chills, fever and joint pain. The condition is caused by bacteria elsewhere in the body. Infectious arthritis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent irreversible joint damage.

<a href="Psoriasis">Psoriasis</a> can develop into psoriatic arthritis. With psoriatic arthritis, most individuals develop the skin problem first and then the arthritis. The typical features are of continuous joint pains, stiffness and swelling. The disease does recur with periods of <a href="remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a> but there is no cure for the disorder. A small percentage develop a severe painful and destructive form of arthritis which destroys the small joints in the hands and can lead to permanent disability and loss of hand function.

There is no known cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include <a href="physical%20therapy">physical therapy</a>, lifestyle changes (including exercise and weight control), <a href="Brace%20%28orthopaedic%29">orthopedic bracing</a>, and medications. <a href="Joint%20replacement%20surgery">Joint replacement surgery</a> may be required in eroding forms of arthritis. Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain. Moreover, by decreasing inflammation, the joint damage may be slowed.

In general, studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can noticeably improve long-term pain relief. Furthermore, exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person.

Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>. In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited. Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function, decrease pain, and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases. Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee. Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength, endurance and flexibility. In some cases, exercises may be designed to train balance. Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities as well as equipment.

There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective.

Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> is <a href="acetaminophen">acetaminophen</a> (paracetamol) while for <a href="inflammatory%20arthritis">inflammatory arthritis</a> it involves <a href="non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s (NSAIDs) like <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>. <a href="Opioid">Opioid</a>s and NSAIDs are less well tolerated.

<a href="Rheumatoid%20arthritis">Rheumatoid arthritis</a> (RA) is <a href="autoimmune">autoimmune</a> so in addition to using pain medications and anti-inflammatory drugs, this type uses another category of drug called <a href="disease-modifying%20anti-rheumatic%20drug">disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug</a>s (DMARDs). An example of this type of drug is <a href="Methotrexate">Methotrexate</a>. These types of drugs act on the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> and slow down the progression of RA.

A number of <a href="Rheumasurgery">rheumasurgical</a> interventions have been incorporated in the treatment of arthritis since the 1950s. <a href="Arthroscopic%20surgery">Arthroscopic surgery</a> for osteoarthritis of the knee provides no additional benefit to optimized physical and medical therapy.

Further research is required to determine if <a href="transcutaneous%20electrical%20nerve%20stimulation">transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</a> (TENS) for knee osteoarthritis is effective for controlling pain.

<a href="Low%20level%20laser%20therapy">Low level laser therapy</a> may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Evidence of benefit is tentative.

<a href="Pulsed%20electromagnetic%20field%20therapy">Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy</a> has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. The FDA has not approved PEMF for the treatment of arthritis. In Canada, PEMF devices are legally licensed by Health Canada for the treatment of pain associated with arthritic conditions.

Arthritis is predominantly a disease of the elderly, but children can also be affected by the disease. More than 70% of individuals in North America affected by arthritis are over the age of 65. Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races, <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>s and cultures. In the United States a CDC survey based on data from 2007–2009 showed 22.2% (49.9 million) of adults aged ≥18 years had self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis, and 9.4% (21.1 million or 42.4% of those with arthritis) had arthritis-attributable activity limitation (AAAL). With an aging population, this number is expected to increase.

Disability due to <a href="musculoskeletal%20disorder">musculoskeletal disorder</a>s increased by 45% from 1990 to 2010. Of these, osteoarthritis is the fastest increasing major health condition. Among the many reports on the increased prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions, data from Africa are lacking and underestimated. A <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a> assessed the prevalence of arthritis in Africa and included twenty population-based and seven hospital-based studies. The majority of studies, twelve, were from South Africa. Nine studies were well-conducted, eleven studies were of moderate quality, and seven studies were conducted poorly. The results of the systematic review were as follows:

Evidence of osteoarthritis and potentially inflammatory arthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs. The first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as <a href="4500%20BC">4500 BC</a>. In early reports, arthritis was frequently referred to as the most common ailment of prehistoric peoples. It was noted in skeletal remains of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> found in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and parts of what is now <a href="Olathe%2C%20Kansas">Olathe, Kansas</a>. Evidence of arthritis has been found throughout history, from <a href="%C3%96tzi%20the%20Iceman">Ötzi</a>, a <a href="mummy">mummy</a> (circa 3000 BC) found along the border of modern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, to the Egyptian mummies circa 2590 BC.

In 1715, <a href="William%20Musgrave">William Musgrave</a> published the second edition of his most important medical work, "De arthritide symptomatica", which concerned arthritis and its effects.

The word 'arthritides' denotes the collective group of arthritis-like conditions.

Acetylene

Acetylene (<a href="Chemical%20nomenclature">systematic name</a>: ethyne) is the <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a> with the formula CH. It is a <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> and the simplest <a href="alkyne">alkyne</a>. This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block. It is unstable in its pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution. Pure acetylene is odorless, but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities.

As an alkyne, acetylene is <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">unsaturated</a> because its two carbon atoms are <a href="Chemical%20bond">bonded</a> together in a <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a>. The carbon–carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180°.

Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by <a href="Edmund%20Davy">Edmund Davy</a>, who identified it as a "new carburet of hydrogen". It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist <a href="Marcellin%20Berthelot">Marcellin Berthelot</a>, who coined the name "acétylène".
Berthelot's empirical formula for acetylene (CH), as well as the alternative name "quadricarbure d'hydrogène" ("hydrogen quadricarbide") were incorrect because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic mass for carbon (6 instead of 12).
Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds (methanol, ethanol, etc.) through a red-hot tube and collecting the <a href="effluent">effluent</a>. He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed <a href="cyanogen">cyanogen</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gases. Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a <a href="arc%20lamp">carbon arc</a>. Commercially available acetylene gas could smell foul due to the common impurities <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> and <a href="phosphine">phosphine</a>. However, as purity increases it will become odourless.

Since the 1950s, acetylene has mainly been manufactured by the partial <a href="combustion">combustion</a> of <a href="methane">methane</a> or appears as a side product in the <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> stream from <a href="Cracking%20%28chemistry%29">cracking</a> of <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s. Approximately 400,000 tonnes were produced by this method in 1983. Its presence in ethylene is usually undesirable because of its explosive character and its ability to poison <a href="Ziegler%E2%80%93Natta%20catalyst">Ziegler–Natta catalyst</a>s. It is selectively hydrogenated into <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a>, usually using Pd–Ag catalysts.

Until the 1950s, when <a href="petroleum">oil</a> supplanted <a href="coal">coal</a> as the chief source of <a href="redox">reduced</a> carbon, acetylene (and the aromatic fraction from <a href="coal%20tar">coal tar</a>) was the main source of organic chemicals in the chemical industry. It was prepared by the <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of <a href="calcium%20carbide">calcium carbide</a>, a reaction discovered by <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> in 1862 and still familiar to students:

Calcium carbide production requires extremely high temperatures, ~2000 °C, necessitating the use of an <a href="electric%20arc%20furnace">electric arc furnace</a>. In the US, this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive <a href="hydroelectric%20power">hydroelectric power</a> project at <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>.

In terms of <a href="valence%20bond%20theory">valence bond theory</a>, in each carbon atom the 2s <a href="Atomic%20orbital">orbital</a> <a href="Orbital%20hybridisation">hybridizes</a> with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid. The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized. The two ends of the two sp hybrid <a href="orbital%20overlap">orbital overlap</a> to form a strong <a href="Sigma%20bond">σ valence bond</a> between the carbons, while on each of the other two ends hydrogen atoms attach also by σ bonds. The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker <a href="pi%20bond">π bonds</a>.

Since acetylene is a linear <a href="molecular%20symmetry">symmetrical molecule</a>, it possesses the D <a href="Molecular%20symmetry%23Point%20group">point group</a>.

At atmospheric pressure, acetylene cannot exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point. The <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> on the <a href="phase%20diagram">phase diagram</a> corresponds to the melting point (−80.8 °C) at the minimum pressure at which liquid acetylene can exist (1.27 atm). At temperatures below the triple point, solid acetylene can change directly to the <a href="vapour">vapour</a> (gas) by <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a>. The sublimation point at atmospheric pressure is −84.0°C.

The <a href="adiabatic">adiabatic</a> flame temperature in air at <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a> is 2534 °C. 

Acetylene gas can be dissolved in <a href="acetone">acetone</a> or <a href="dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a> in room temperature and 1 atm. 

Since acetylene has a <a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant">pK</a> of 25, acetylene can be <a href="deprotonation">deprotonated</a> by a <a href="superbase">superbase</a> to form an <a href="acetylide">acetylide</a>:

Various <a href="organometallic">organometallic</a> and <a href="Inorganic%20compound">inorganic</a> reagents are effective. The formation of the acetylide depends upon several factors such as the <a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant%23Bases%20and%20basicity">pK</a> of the base, the <a href="Valence%20%28chemistry%29">valency</a> of the metal, and <a href="solvent">solvent</a> characteristics.

<a href="Copper%28I%29%20acetylide">Copper(I) acetylide</a> and <a href="silver%20acetylide">silver acetylide</a> can be formed in <a href="aqueous">aqueous</a> solutions with especial ease due to a poor <a href="solubility%20equilibrium">solubility equilibrium</a>.

<a href="Walter%20Reppe">Walter Reppe</a> discovered that in the presence of metal <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s, acetylene can react to give a wide range of industrially significant chemicals.

Approximately 20 percent of acetylene is supplied by the <a href="Industrial%20gas">industrial gases industry</a> for <a href="oxyacetylene">oxyacetylene</a> <a href="gas%20welding">gas welding</a> and <a href="Oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">cutting</a> due to the high temperature of the flame; combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing 11.8 <a href="Kilojoule">kJ</a>/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common fuel gas. Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after <a href="dicyanoacetylene">dicyanoacetylene</a>'s and <a href="cyanogen">cyanogen</a> at . <a href="Oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">Oxy-acetylene welding</a> was a very popular welding process in previous decades; however, the development and advantages of <a href="arc%20welding">arc-based welding processes</a> have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding "equipment" is quite versatile – not only because the torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. <a href="Bell%20Canada">Bell Canada</a> cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a <a href="soldering">soldering</a> tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in <a href="manhole">manhole</a>s and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a <a href="flashback%20%28welding%29">flashback</a>), acetylene will <a href="decompose">decompose</a> explosively into <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="carbon">carbon</a>. 

<a href="Calcium%20carbide">Calcium carbide</a> was used to generate acetylene used in the lamps for portable or remote applications. It was used for miners and cavers before the widespread use of <a href="Incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent lighting</a>; or many years later low-power/high-lumen LED lighting; and is still used by mining industries in some nations without workplace safety laws. It was also used as an early light source for lighthouses.

Except in China, use of acetylene as a chemical feedstock has declined by 70% from 1965 to 2007 owing to cost and environmental considerations.
Acetylene can be <a href="semihydrogenation">semihydrogenated</a> to <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a>, providing a feedstock for a variety of <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> plastics. Another major application of acetylene, especially in China is its conversion to <a href="acrylic%20acid">acrylic acid</a> <a href="Derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a>. These derivatives form products such as <a href="acrylic%20fiber">acrylic fiber</a>s, <a href="Acrylic%20glass">glass</a>es, <a href="Acrylic%20paint">paint</a>s, <a href="Acrylic%20resin">resin</a>s, and <a href="Acrylate%20polymer">polymer</a>s.

In 1881, the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov described the <a href="Hydration%20reaction">hydration</a> of acetylene to <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a> using catalysts such as <a href="mercury%28II%29%20bromide">mercury(II) bromide</a>. Before the advent of the <a href="Wacker%20process">Wacker process</a>, this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale.

The <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> of acetylene with <a href="Ziegler-Natta%20catalyst">Ziegler-Natta catalyst</a>s produces <a href="polyacetylene">polyacetylene</a> films. Polyacetylene, a chain of CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, was one of the first discovered <a href="organic%20semiconductor">organic semiconductor</a>s. Its reaction with <a href="iodine">iodine</a> produces a highly electrically conducting material. Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries led to the developments of <a href="organic%20semiconductor">organic semiconductor</a>s, as recognized by the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 2000 to <a href="Alan%20J.%20Heeger">Alan J. Heeger</a>, <a href="Alan%20G%20MacDiarmid">Alan G MacDiarmid</a>, and <a href="Hideki%20Shirakawa">Hideki Shirakawa</a>.

In the early 20th century acetylene was widely used for illumination, including street lighting in some towns. Most early automobiles used <a href="carbide%20lamp">carbide lamp</a>s before the adoption of electric headlights. 

Acetylene is sometimes used for <a href="carburization">carburization</a> (that is, hardening) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace.

Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a>. The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with <a href="lithium">lithium</a> metal in a small specialized research furnace to form <a href="lithium%20carbide">lithium carbide</a> (also known as lithium acetylide). The carbide can then be reacted with water, as usual, to form acetylene gas to be fed into <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a> to measure the isotopic ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.

The energy richness of the C≡C triple bond and the rather high solubility of acetylene in water make it a suitable substrate for bacteria, provided an adequate source is available . A number of bacteria living on acetylene have been identified. The <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="acetylene%20hydratase">acetylene hydratase</a> catalyzes the hydration of acetylene to give acetaldehyde.

Acetylene is a moderately common chemical in the universe, often associated with the atmospheres of <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s. One curious discovery of acetylene is on <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, a moon of <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>. Natural acetylene is believed to form from <a href="Catalysis">catalytic</a> decomposition of long-chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of and above. Since such temperatures are highly unlikely on such a small distant body, this discovery is potentially suggestive of catalytic reactions within that moon, making it a promising site to search for prebiotic chemistry.

Acetylene is not especially toxic but, when generated from <a href="calcium%20carbide">calcium carbide</a>, it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of <a href="phosphine">phosphine</a> and <a href="arsine">arsine</a>, which give it a distinct garlic-like smell . It is also highly flammable, as most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically <a href="benzene">benzene</a> and/or <a href="vinylacetylene">vinylacetylene</a>, possibly in addition to <a href="carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> . Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about . Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report <a href="gauge%20pressure">gauge pressure</a> and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPa or 15 psig. It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in <a href="acetone">acetone</a> or <a href="dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a> (DMF), contained in a <a href="gas%20cylinder">gas cylinder</a> with a porous filling (<a href="Agamassan">Agamassan</a>), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling. Acetylene cylinders should be used in the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use.

Information on safe storage of acetylene in upright cylinders is provided by the OSHA, Compressed Gas Association, United States Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), EIGA, and other agencies.

<a href="Copper">Copper</a> catalyses the decomposition of acetylene and as a result acetylene should not be transported in copper pipes. <a href="Brass">Brass</a> pipe fittings should also be avoided.

Cylinders should be stored in an area segregated from oxidizers to avoid exacerbated reaction in case of fire/leakage. Acetylene cylinders should not be stored in confined spaces / enclosed vehicles / garages / buildings to avoid unintended leakage leading to explosive atmosphere. In the USA, National Electric Code (NEC) requires consideration for hazardous areas including those where acetylene may be released during accidents or leaks. Consideration may include electrical classification and use of listed Group A electrical components in USA. Further information on determining the areas requiring special consideration is in NFPA 497. In Europe, ATEX also requires consideration for hazardous areas where flammable gases may be released during accidents or leaks.

Arabic numerals

Arabic numerals, also called Hindu–Arabic numerals are the ten <a href="numerical%20digit">digits</a>: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, based on the <a href="Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic%20numeral%20system">Hindu–Arabic numeral system</a>, the most common system for the symbolic representation of <a href="number">number</a>s in the world today. In this <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a>, a sequence of digits such as "975" is read as a single number, using the position of the digit in the sequence to interpret its value. It was originally developed by ancient <a href="Indian%20mathematics">mathematicians in the Indian subcontinent</a> around AD 500.

The system was adopted by <a href="Arabic%20mathematics">Arabic mathematicians</a> in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and passed on to the Arabs farther west. There is some evidence to suggest that the numerals in their current form developed from <a href="Abjad%20numerals">Arabic letters</a> in the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>, the western region of the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>. The current form of the numerals developed in North Africa, distinct in form from the Indian and <a href="Eastern%20Arabic%20numerals">Eastern Arabic numerals</a>. It was in the North African city of <a href="Bejaia">Bejaia</a> that the <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> scholar <a href="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> first encountered the numerals; his work was crucial in making them known throughout Europe and then further to the Europeans who spread it worldwide. The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade, books and <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a>.

The term "Arabic numerals" is ambiguous. It most commonly refers to the numerals widely used in Europe and the Americas; to avoid confusion, <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> calls these "European digits". "Arabic numerals" is also the conventional name for the entire family of related numerals of Arabic and <a href="Indian%20numerals">Indian numerals</a>. It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs, in which case it generally refers to the Eastern Arabic numerals. It would be more appropriate to refer to the "Arabic numeral system", where the value of a digit in a number depends on its position.

Although the phrase "Arabic numeral" is frequently capitalized, it is sometimes written in lower case: for instance, in its entry in the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>", which helps to distinguish it from "Arabic numerals" as the East Arabic numerals specific to the Arabs.

The decimal Hindu–Arabic numeral system was developed in India by around AD 700. The development was gradual, spanning several centuries, but the decisive step was probably provided by <a href="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a>'s formulation of <a href="zero">zero</a> as a number in AD 628. The system was revolutionary by including zero in <a href="positional%20notation">positional notation</a>, thereby limiting the number of individual digits to ten. It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics. One may distinguish between this positional "system", which is identical throughout the family, and the precise <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s used to write the numerals, which varied regionally.

The glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a> since <a href="Early%20modern%20period">early modern times</a> are <a href="0%20%28number%29">0</a> <a href="1%20%28number%29">1</a> <a href="2%20%28number%29">2</a> <a href="3%20%28number%29">3</a> <a href="4%20%28number%29">4</a> <a href="5%20%28number%29">5</a> <a href="6%20%28number%29">6</a> <a href="7%20%28number%29">7</a> <a href="8%20%28number%29">8</a> <a href="9%20%28number%29">9</a>.
The first universally accepted inscription containing the use of the 0 glyph in India is first recorded in the 9th century, in an inscription at <a href="Gwalior">Gwalior</a> in <a href="Central%20India">Central India</a> dated to 870. Numerous Indian documents on <a href="Indian%20copper%20plate%20inscriptions">copper plates</a> exist, with the same symbol for zero in them, dated back as far as the 6th century AD, but their dates are uncertain. Inscriptions in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> dating to AD 683 have also been found.

The <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a> came to be known to both the <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> mathematician <a href="Muhammad%20ibn%20Musa%20al-Khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</a>, whose book "On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals" was written about 825 in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, and the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> mathematician <a href="Al-Kindi">Al-Kindi</a>, who wrote four volumes, "On the Use of the Indian Numerals" ("Ketab fi Isti'mal al-'Adad al-Hindi") about 830. Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle East and the West. 

In the 10th century, <a href="Middle-East">Middle-East</a>ern mathematicians extended the decimal numeral system to include <a href="fractions">fractions</a>, as recorded in a treatise by <a href="Syrian">Syrian</a> mathematician <a href="Abu%27l-Hasan%20al-Uqlidisi">Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi</a> in 952–953. The <a href="decimal%20point">decimal point</a> notation was introduced by <a href="Sind%20ibn%20Ali">Sind ibn Ali</a>, who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.

A distinctive West Arabic variant of the symbols begins to emerge around the 10th century in the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> and <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>, called "ghubar" ("sand-table" or "dust-table") numerals, which are the direct ancestor of the modern Western Arabic numerals used throughout the world. Ghubar numerals themselves are probably of Roman origin.

Some popular myths have argued that the original forms of these symbols indicated their numeric value through the number of angles they contained, but no evidence exists of any such origin.

In 825 <a href="Mu%E1%B8%A5ammad%20ibn%20M%C5%ABs%C4%81%20al-Khw%C4%81rizm%C4%AB">Al-Khwārizmī</a> wrote a treatise in Arabic, "On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals", which survives only as the 12th-century Latin translation, "Algoritmi de numero Indorum". "Algoritmi", the translator's rendition of the author's name, gave rise to the word "<a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>".

The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the "<a href="Codex%20Vigilanus">Codex Vigilanus</a>" of 976.

From the 980s, Gerbert of <a href="Aurillac">Aurillac</a> (later, <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a>) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe. Gerbert studied in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in his youth. He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a> from <a href="Lupitus%20of%20Barcelona">Lupitus of Barcelona</a> after he had returned to France.

<a href="Leonardo%20Fibonacci">Leonardo Fibonacci</a> (<a href="Leonardo%20of%20Pisa">Leonardo of Pisa</a>), a mathematician born in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Pisa">Republic of Pisa</a> who had studied in <a href="B%C3%A9ja%C3%AFa">Béjaïa</a> (Bougie), <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, promoted the Indian numeral system in Europe with his 1202 book "<a href="Liber%20Abaci">Liber Abaci</a>":

When my father, who had been appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at <a href="B%C3%A9ja%C3%AFa">Bugia</a> acting for the <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>n merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.

The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right, with higher value positions added to the left. This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe. Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left-to-right, unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet. Hence, from the point of view of the reader, numerals in Western texts are written with the highest power of the base first whereas numerals in Arabic texts are written with the lowest power of the base first.

The reason the digits are more commonly known as "Arabic numerals" in Europe and the Americas is that they were introduced to Europe in the 10th century by Arabic-speakers of North Africa, who were then using the digits from Libya to Morocco. Arabs, on the other hand, call the system "<a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> numerals", referring to their origin in India. This is not to be confused with what the Arabs call the "Hindi numerals", namely the <a href="Eastern%20Arabic%20numerals">Eastern Arabic numerals</a> ( - - - - - - - - - ) used in the Middle East, or any of the numerals currently used in <a href="Languages%20of%20India">Indian languages</a> (e.g. <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a>: ).

The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>, and they became widely known during the 15th century. Early evidence of their use in <a href="Great%20Britain%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Britain</a> includes: an equal hour horary <a href="quadrant%20%28instrument%29">quadrant</a> from 1396, in England, a 1445 inscription on the tower of <a href="Heathfield%20and%20Waldron">Heathfield</a> Church, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>; a 1448 inscription on a wooden lych-gate of <a href="Bray%2C%20Berkshire">Bray</a> Church, <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>; and a 1487 inscription on the belfry door at <a href="Piddletrenthide">Piddletrenthide</a> church, <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>; and in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> a 1470 inscription on the tomb of the first Earl of Huntly in <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin</a> Cathedral. (See G.F. Hill, "The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe" for more examples.) In central Europe, the <a href="King%20of%20Hungary">King of Hungary</a> <a href="Ladislaus%20the%20Posthumous">Ladislaus the Posthumous</a>, started the use of Arabic numerals, which appear for the first time in a royal document of 1456. By the mid-16th century, they were in common use in most of Europe. <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a> remained in use mostly for the notation of <a href="Anno%20Domini">Anno Domini</a> years, and for numbers on clockfaces.

Today, Roman numerals are still used for enumeration of lists (as an alternative to alphabetical enumeration), for sequential volumes, to differentiate monarchs or family members with the same first names, and (in lower case) to number pages in prefatory material in books.

<a href="Cyrillic%20numerals">Cyrillic numerals</a> were a numbering system derived from the <a href="Early%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic alphabet</a>, used by <a href="South%20Slavs">South</a> and <a href="East%20Slavs">East</a> <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic peoples</a>. The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> replaced it with Arabic numerals.

Arabic numerals were introduced to China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) by the Muslim <a href="Hui%20people">Hui people</a>. In the early 17th century, European-style Arabic numerals were introduced by Spanish and Portuguese Jesuits.

The numeral system employed, known as <a href="algorism">algorism</a>, is <a href="positional%20notation">positional</a> <a href="decimal">decimal</a> notation. Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which may have evolved from the <a href="Brahmi%20numerals">Brahmi numerals</a>, or developed independently from it. The symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>:


The evolution of the numerals in early Europe is shown on a table created by the French scholar <a href="Jean-%C3%89tienne%20Montucla">Jean-Étienne Montucla</a> in his "Histoire de la Mathematique", which was published in 1757:

The Arabic numeral glyphs 0–9 are encoded in <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> and <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> at positions 0x30 to 0x39, matching up with the second <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> digit for convenience:

Apuleius

Apuleius (; also called Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis and in c. 124 – c. 170 AD) was a <a href="Latin">Latin</a>-language prose writer, platonist philosopher and rhetorian. He was a <a href="Numidians">Numidian</a> who lived under the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and was from <a href="Madauros">Madauros</a> (now <a href="M%27Daourouch">M'Daourouch</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>). He studied <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, travelled to <a href="Roman%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia Minor</a>, and <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt</a> and was an initiate in several cults or <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">mysteries</a>. The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions (and fortune) of a wealthy widow. He declaimed and then distributed a witty "tour de force" in his own defense before the <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> and a court of magistrates convened in <a href="Sabratha">Sabratha</a>, near ancient <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>, Libya. This is known as the "Apologia".

His most famous work is his <a href="ribaldry">bawdy</a> <a href="picaresque%20novel">picaresque novel</a>, the "Metamorphoses", otherwise known as "<a href="The%20Golden%20Ass">The Golden Ass</a>". It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety. It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a <a href="donkey">donkey</a>.

Apuleius was born in Madauros, a <a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">colonia</a> in <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> on the <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>n coast bordering <a href="Gaetuli">Gaetuli</a>a, and he described himself as "half-Numidian half-Gaetulian." Madaurus was the same "colonia" where <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> later received part of his early education, and, though located well away from the <a href="Romanization%20%28cultural%29">Romanized</a> coast, is today the site of some pristine Roman ruins. As to his first name, no "<a href="praenomen">praenomen</a>" is given in any ancient source; late-medieval manuscripts began the tradition of calling him "Lucius" from the name of the hero of his novel. Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech ("Apology") and his work "<a href="Florida%20%28Apuleius%29">Florida</a>", which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches.

His father was a provincial magistrate ("<a href="duumvirate">duumvir</a>") who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two million <a href="sestertius">sesterces</a> to his two sons. Apuleius studied with a master at <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> (where he later settled) and later at <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects. He subsequently went to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> to study Latin <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and, most likely, to speak in the law courts for a time before returning to his native North Africa. He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt, studying philosophy and religion, burning up his inheritance while doing so.

Apuleius was an initiate in several <a href="Greco-Roman%20mysteries">Greco-Roman mysteries</a>, including the <a href="Dionysian%20Mysteries">Dionysian Mysteries</a>. He was a priest of <a href="Asclepius">Asclepius</a> and, according to Augustine, "sacerdos provinciae Africae" (i.e., priest of the province of Carthage).

Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. On his way there he was taken ill at the town of <a href="Oea">Oea</a> (modern-day <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>) and was hospitably received into the house of Sicinius Pontianus, with whom he had been friends when he had studied in Athens. The mother of Pontianus, Pudentilla, was a very rich widow. With her son's consent – indeed encouragement – Apuleius agreed to marry her. Meanwhile, Pontianus himself married the daughter of one Herennius Rufinus; he, indignant that Pudentilla's wealth should pass out of the family, instigated his son-in-law, together with a younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, a mere boy, and their paternal uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to join him in impeaching Apuleius upon the charge that he had gained the affections of Pudentilla by charms and magic spells. The case was heard at <a href="Sabratha">Sabratha</a>, near Tripoli, c. 158 AD, before <a href="Claudius%20Maximus">Claudius Maximus</a>, <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a>. The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous, and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant. This is known as the "Apologia (A Discourse on Magic)".

Apuleius accused an extravagant personal enemy of turning his house into a brothel and prostituting his own wife.

Of his subsequent career we know little. Judging from the many works of which he was author, he must have devoted himself diligently to literature. He occasionally gave speeches in public to great reception; he had the charge of exhibiting gladiatorial shows and wild beast events in the province, and statues were erected in his honor by the senate of Carthage and of other senates.

"The Golden Ass" ("Asinus Aureus") or "Metamorphoses" is the only <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> novel that has survived in its entirety. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into an <a href="donkey">ass</a>. In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things, until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way. Within this <a href="frame%20story">frame story</a> are found many <a href="story%20within%20a%20story">digressions</a>, the longest among them being the well-known tale of <a href="Cupid%20and%20Psyche">Cupid and Psyche</a>.

The "Metamorphoses" ends with the (once again human) hero, Lucius, eager to be initiated into the <a href="mysteries%20of%20Isis">mystery cult of Isis</a>; he abstains from forbidden foods, bathes, and purifies himself. He is introduced to the "<a href="Navigium%20Isidis">Navigium Isidis</a>". Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him, and further secrets are revealed before he goes through the process of initiation, which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> in Rome, and eventually is initiated into the "pastophoroi" – a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris. The adventures of the ass stand at the beginning of the <a href="picaresque%20novel">picaresque novel</a> tradition which eventually produced "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Tom%20Jones%2C%20a%20Foundling">The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling</a>".

His other works are:


Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived. He wrote works of <a href="poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="fiction">fiction</a>, as well as technical treatises on <a href="politics">politics</a>, <a href="dendrology">dendrology</a>, <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="music">music</a>, and <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, and he translated Plato's "<a href="Phaedo">Phaedo</a>".

The extant works wrongly attributed to Apuleius are:


The Apuleian Sphere described in "<a href="Petosiris%20to%20Nechepso">Petosiris to Nechepso</a>", also known as "<a href="Columcille%20the%20Scribe">Columcille's</a> Circle" or "Petosiris' Circle", is a magical prognosticating device for predicting the survival of a patient.

Alexander Selkirk

Alexander Selkirk (167613 December 1721) was a Scottish <a href="privateer">privateer</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> officer who spent more than four years as a <a href="castaway">castaway</a> (1704–1709) after being <a href="marooning">marooned</a> by his <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a> on an uninhabited island in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>. He survived that ordeal, but succumbed to tropical illness a dozen years later while serving aboard off West Africa.

Selkirk was an unruly youth, and joined <a href="buccaneer">buccaneer</a>ing voyages to the South Pacific during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. One such expedition was on "<a href="Cinque%20Ports%20%281703%20ship%29">Cinque Ports</a>", commanded by <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a>. The ship called in for provisions at the <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Islands">Juan Fernández Islands</a>, and Selkirk judged correctly that the craft was unseaworthy and asked to be left there.

When he was eventually rescued by follow-on English privateer <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a>, Selkirk had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources that he found on the island. His story of survival was widely publicised after their return to England, becoming a source of inspiration for writer <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>'s fictional character <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>.

Alexander Selkirk was the son of a shoemaker and tanner in <a href="Lower%20Largo">Lower Largo</a>, <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, Scotland, born in 1676. In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition. He was summoned before the <a href="Kirk%20Session">Kirk Session</a> in August 1693 for his "indecent conduct in church", but he "did not appear, being gone to sea". He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for beating up his brothers.

Early on, he was engaged in <a href="buccaneer">buccaneer</a>ing. In 1703 he joined an expedition of English <a href="privateer">privateer</a> and explorer <a href="William%20Dampier">William Dampier</a> to the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>, setting sail from <a href="Kinsale">Kinsale</a> in Ireland on 11 September. They carried <a href="letter%20of%20marque">letters of marque</a> from the <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Denmark">Lord High Admiral</a> authorising their armed merchant ships to attack foreign enemies as the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> was then going on between England and Spain. Dampier was <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a> of "St George" and Selkirk served on "<a href="Cinque%20Ports%20%281703%20ship%29">Cinque Ports</a>", "St George"s companion ship, as <a href="sailing%20master">sailing master</a> under Captain Thomas Stradling. By this time, Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea.

In February 1704, following a stormy passage around <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, the privateers fought a long battle with a well-armed French vessel, "St Joseph", only to have it escape to warn its Spanish allies of their arrival in the Pacific. A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%2C%20Herrera">Santa María</a> failed when their landing party was <a href="ambush">ambush</a>ed. The easy capture of "Asunción", a heavily laden merchantman, revived the men's hopes of plunder, and Selkirk was put in charge of the <a href="prize%20ship">prize ship</a>. Dampier took off some much-needed provisions of wine, brandy, sugar and flour; then abruptly set the ship free, arguing that the gain was not worth the effort. In May 1704 Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own.

In September 1704, after parting ways with Dampier, Captain Stradling brought "Cinque Ports" to an island known to the Spanish as <a href="M%C3%A1s%20a%20Tierra">Más a Tierra</a> located in the uninhabited <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Islands">Juan Fernández archipelago</a> off the coast of Chile for a mid-expedition restocking of fresh water and supplies.

Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of their vessel, and probably wanted to make needed repairs before going any farther. He declared that he would rather stay on Juan Fernández than continue in a dangerously leaky ship. Glad to be rid of a troublemaker, Stradling took him up on the offer and landed Selkirk on the island with a <a href="musket">musket</a>, a <a href="hatchet">hatchet</a>, a knife, a cooking pot, a <a href="King%20James%20Bible">Bible</a>, bedding and some clothes. Selkirk regretted his rashness, but Stradling refused to let him back on board.

"Cinque Ports" did indeed later founder off the coast of what is now Colombia. Stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish. The survivors were taken to <a href="Lima%2C%20Peru">Lima</a>, Peru, where they endured a harsh imprisonment.

At first, Selkirk remained along the shoreline of Juan Fernández. During this time he ate <a href="spiny%20lobster">spiny lobster</a>s and scanned the ocean daily for rescue, suffering all the while from loneliness, misery and remorse. Hordes of raucous <a href="Mirounga%20leonina">sea lions</a>, gathered on the beach for the mating season, eventually drove him to the island's interior. Once inland, his way of life took a turn for the better. More foods were available there: <a href="feral%20goat">feral goat</a>s—introduced by earlier sailors—provided him with meat and milk, while wild <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s, <a href="Dendroseris%20litoralis">cabbage leaves</a> and dried <a href="pink%20peppercorn">pepper berries</a> offered him variety and spice. <a href="Rat">Rat</a>s would attack him at night, but he was able to sleep soundly and in safety by domesticating and living near <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s.
Selkirk proved resourceful in using materials that he found on the island: he forged a new knife out of <a href="barrel">barrel</a> hoops left on the beach, he built two huts out of <a href="Schinus%20molle">pepper</a> trees, one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping, and he employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses. As his gunpowder dwindled, he had to chase prey on foot. During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff, lying helpless and unable to move for about a day. His prey had cushioned his fall, probably sparing him a broken back.

Childhood lessons learned from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he had no need to replace them, since his toughened, calloused feet made protection unnecessary. He sang <a href="Psalms%23The%20Psalms%20in%20Christian%20worship">psalms</a> and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English.

During his sojourn on the island two vessels came to anchor. Unfortunately for Selkirk, both were Spanish. As a Scotsman and a privateer, he risked a grim fate if captured and, therefore, tried to hide himself. On one occasion he was spotted and chased by a group of sailors from one of the ships. His pursuers urinated beneath the tree in which he was hiding but failed to discover him. Frustrated, his would-be captors gave up and sailed away.

Selkirk's long-awaited deliverance came on 2 February 1709 by way of "Duke", a privateering ship <a href="maritime%20pilot">piloted</a> by William Dampier, and its sailing companion "Duchess". <a href="Thomas%20Dover">Thomas Dover</a> led the landing party that met Selkirk. After four years and four months without human company, Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy. The "Duke" captain and leader of the expedition was <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a>, who mischievously referred to him as the governor of the island. The agile castaway caught two or three goats a day and helped restore the health of Rogers' men, who were suffering from <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>.

Captain Rogers was impressed by Selkirk's physical vigour, but also by the peace of mind that he had attained while living on the island, observing: "One may see that solitude and retirement from the world is not such an insufferable state of life as most men imagine, especially when people are fairly called or thrown into it unavoidably, as this man was." He made Selkirk "Duke"s <a href="second%20mate">second mate</a>, later giving him command of one of their prize ships, "Increase", before it was ransomed by the Spanish.

Selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance. At <a href="Guayaquil">Guayaquil</a> in present-day Ecuador, he led a boat crew up the <a href="Guayas%20River">Guayas River</a> where a number of wealthy Spanish ladies had fled, and relieved them of the gold and jewels they had hidden inside their clothing. His part in the hunt for treasure <a href="Manila%20galleon">galleons</a> along the coast of Mexico resulted in the capture of "<a href="Spanish%20ship%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Encarnaci%C3%B3n%20y%20Desenga%C3%B1o">Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño</a>", renamed "Bachelor", on which he served as sailing master under Captain Dover to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Selkirk completed the around-the-world voyage by the <a href="Dutch%20Cape%20Colony">Cape of Good Hope</a> as the sailing master of "Duke", arriving at <a href="the%20Downs">the Downs</a> off the English coast on 1 October 1711. He had been away for eight years.

Selkirk's experience as a castaway aroused a great deal of attention in England. Rogers included an account of Selkirk's ordeal in a book chronicling their privateering expedition entitled "A Cruising Voyage Round the World" (1712). The following year, prominent essayist <a href="Richard%20Steele">Richard Steele</a> wrote an article about him for "The Englishman" newspaper. Selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity, claiming his share of "Duke"'s plundered wealth—about £800 (equivalent to £ today). However, legal disputes made the amount of any payment uncertain.

After a few months in <a href="London">London</a>, he began to seem more like his former self again. In September 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and may have been kept in confinement for two years. He returned to Lower Largo, where he met Sophia Bruce, a young dairymaid. They eloped to London early in 1717 but apparently did not marry. He was soon off to sea again, having enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. While on a visit to <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> in 1720, he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis. He was serving as <a href="master%27s%20mate">master's mate</a> on board , engaged in an anti-<a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Piracy%23The%20post-Spanish-Succession%20period">piracy</a> patrol off the west coast of Africa, when he died on 13 December 1721, succumbing to the <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> that plagued the voyage. He was buried at sea.

When <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> published "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">The Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe</a>" (1719), few readers could have missed the resemblance to Selkirk. An illustration on the first page of the novel shows "a rather melancholy-looking man standing on the shore of an island, gazing inland", in the words of modern explorer <a href="Tim%20Severin">Tim Severin</a>. He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins, his feet and shins bare. Yet Crusoe's island is located not in the <a href="mid-latitudes">mid-latitudes</a> of the South Pacific but away in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a>, where the furry attire would hardly be comfortable in the <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical</a> heat. This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was a model for the fictional character, although literary scholars now accept that his was "just one of many survival narratives that Defoe knew about".

The largest of the Juan Fernández Islands, known as <a href="M%C3%A1s%20Afuera">Más Afuera</a>, became <a href="Alejandro%20Selkirk%20Island">Alejandro Selkirk Island</a>, although Selkirk probably never saw that island since it is located to the west.

An <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> expedition to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that could have belonged to Selkirk. It was "a fragment of copper alloy identified as being from a pair of <a href="Caliper%23Divider%20caliper">navigational dividers</a>" dating from the early 18th (or late 17th) century. Selkirk is the only person known to have been on the island at that time who is likely to have had dividers, and was even said by Rogers to have had such instruments in his possession. The artefact was discovered while excavating a site not far from Selkirk's Lookout where the famous castaway is believed to have lived.

Anti-ballistic missile

An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a> designed to counter <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>s (see <a href="missile%20defense">missile defense</a>). Ballistic missiles are used to deliver <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear</a>, <a href="Chemical%20warfare">chemical</a>, <a href="Biological%20warfare">biological</a> or conventional <a href="warhead">warhead</a>s in a <a href="ballistics">ballistic</a> flight <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a>. The term "anti-ballistic missile" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat, however it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s (ICBMs).

There are only three systems in the world that can intercept ICBMs. Besides them, many smaller systems exist (tactical ABMs), that generally cannot intercept intercontinental strategic missiles, even if within range—an incoming ICBM simply moves too fast for these systems.

The Russian <a href="A-35%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-35 anti-ballistic missile system</a>, used for the defense of Moscow, whose development started in 1971. The currently active system is called <a href="A-135%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-135</a>. The system uses Gorgon and <a href="Gazelle%20%28missile%29">Gazelle</a> missiles with <a href="nuclear%20warhead">nuclear warhead</a>s to intercept incoming <a href="Intercontinental%20Ballistic%20Missile">ICBMs</a>.

The U.S. <a href="Ground-Based%20Midcourse%20Defense">Ground-Based Midcourse Defense</a> (GMD; previously known as <a href="National%20Missile%20Defense">National Missile Defense</a> – NMD) system has reached initial operational capability. Instead of using an explosive charge, it launches a <a href="kinetic%20projectile">kinetic projectile</a>. The George W. Bush administration accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration. The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska, and in 2006 was operational with a few interceptor missiles. The Alaska site provides more protection against the <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">nuclear threat</a> from North Korean missiles or launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. President Bush referenced the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in 2001 and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense. The current GMD system has the more limited goal of shielding against a limited attack by a <a href="rogue%20state">rogue state</a> such as <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>.

Israel's Arrow 3 system entered operational service in 2017. It is designed for exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles during the <a href="spaceflight">spaceflight</a> portion of their trajectory, including those of <a href="ICBM">ICBM</a>s. It may also act as an anti-satellite weapon.

During 1993, a symposium was held by western European nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs. In the end, the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems.
During spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the United States and Poland as well as the Czech Republic were published. The plans propose the installation of a latest generation ABM system with a radar site in the Czech Republic and the <a href="U.S.%20missile%20defense%20complex%20in%20Poland">launch site in Poland</a>. The system was announced to be aimed against ICBMs from Iran and North Korea. This caused harsh comments by Russian <a href="President%20of%20Russia">President</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> at the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) security conference during spring 2007 in Munich. Other European ministers commented that any change of strategic weapons should be negotiated on <a href="NATO">NATO</a> level and not 'unilaterally' [sic, actually bilaterally] between the U.S. and other states (although most strategic arms reduction treaties were between the Soviet Union and U.S., not NATO). German foreign minister <a href="Frank-Walter%20Steinmeier">Frank-Walter Steinmeier</a> expressed severe concerns about the way in which the U.S. had conveyed its plans to its European partners and criticised the U.S. administration for not having consulted Russia prior to announcing its endeavours to deploy a new missile defence system in Central Europe. As of July 2007, a majority of Poles were opposed to hosting a component of the system in Poland.

Project 640 had been the PRC's indigenous effort to develop ABM capability. The Academy of Anti-Ballistic Missile & Anti-Satellite was established from 1969 for the purpose of developing Project 640. The project was to involve at least three elements, including the necessary sensors and guidance/command systems, the Fan Ji (FJ) missile interceptor, and the XianFeng missile-intercepting cannon. The FJ-1 had completed two successful flight tests during 1979, while the low-altitude interceptor FJ-2 completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes. A high altitude FJ-3 interceptor was also proposed. Despite the development of missiles, the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons. It was finally closed down during 1980 under a new leadership of Deng Xiaoping as it was seemingly deemed unnecessary after the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States and the closure of the US Safeguard ABM system.

In March 2006, China tested an interceptor system comparable to the U.S. Patriot missiles.

China has acquired and is license-producing the <a href="SA-10A%20Grumble%23S-300PMU-1/2%20%28SA-20%29">S-300PMU-2/S-300PMU-1</a> series of terminal ABM-capable SAMs. China-produced <a href="HQ-9">HQ-9</a> SAM system may possess terminal ABM capabilities. PRC Navy's operating modern air-defense destroyers known as the <a href="Type%20052C">Type 052C Destroyer</a> and <a href="Type%20051C%20destroyer">Type 051C Destroyer</a> are armed with naval HHQ-9 missiles.

The HQ-19, similar to the <a href="THAAD">THAAD</a>, was first tested in 2003, and subsequently a few more times, including in November 2015. The HQ-29, a counterpart to the <a href="MIM-104%20Patriot%23MIM-104F%20.28PAC-3.29">MIM-104F PAC-3</a>, was first tested in 2011.

<a href="Surface-to-air%20missile">Surface-to-air missile</a>s that supposedly have some terminal ABM capability (as opposed to midcourse capability):

The technology and experience from the successful <a href="2007%20Chinese%20anti-satellite%20missile%20test">anti-satellite test</a> using a ground-launched interceptor during January 2007 was immediately applied to current ABM efforts and development.

China carried out a <a href="2010%20Chinese%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20test">land-based anti-ballistic missile test</a> on 11 January 2010. The test was exoatmospheric and done in midcourse phase and with a <a href="kinetic%20kill%20vehicle">kinetic kill vehicle</a>. China is the second country after US that demonstrated intercepting ballistic missile with a <a href="kinetic%20kill%20vehicle">kinetic kill vehicle</a>, the interceptor missile was a <a href="DF-21%23KT%20ABM/ASAT">SC-19</a>. The sources suggest the system is not operationally deployed as of 2010.

On 27 January 2013, China did another anti ballistic missile test. According to the Chinese Defence Ministry, the missile launch is defensive in character and is not aimed against any countries. Experts hailed China's technological breakthrough because it is difficult to intercept ballistic missiles that have reached the highest point and speed in the middle of their course. Only 2 countries, including the US, have successfully conducted such a test in the past decade.
Rumored midcourse missiles:

Italy and France have developed a missile family called <a href="Aster%20%28missile%20family%29">Aster</a> (Aster 15 and Aster 30). Aster 30 is capable of ballistic missile defense. On 18 October 2010, France announced a successful tactical ABM test of the Aster 30 missile and on 1 December 2011 a successful interception of a Black Sparrow ballistic target missile. <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Type%2045%20destroyer">Type 45 destroyer</a>s and <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> and <a href="Italian%20Navy">Italian Navy</a> <a href="Horizon%20class%20frigate">"Horizon" -class frigates</a> are armed with <a href="PAAMS">PAAMS</a>, using Aster 15 and Aster 30 missiles. is in developing another version, the Aster 30 block II, which can destroy ballistic missiles at a maximum range of 3000 km. It will have a Kill Vehicle warhead.

India has an active ABM development effort using indigenously developed and integrated radars, and indigenous missiles. In November 2006, India successfully conducted the <a href="Indian%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Defence%20Programme%23Prithvi%20Air%20Defense%20Exercise">PADE (Prithvi Air Defence Exercise)</a> in which an anti-ballistic missile, called the <a href="Indian%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Defense%20Program%23Prithvi%20Air%20Defence%20%28PAD%29">Prithvi Air Defence (PAD)</a>, an "exo-atmospheric" (outside the atmosphere) interceptor system, intercepted a Prithvi-II ballistic missile. The PAD missile has the secondary stage of the Prithvi missile and can reach altitude of . During the test, the target missile was intercepted at a altitude. India became the fourth nation in the world after United States, Russia, and Israel to acquire such a capability and the third nation to acquire it using in-house research and development. On 6 December 2007, the <a href="Indian%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Defense%20Program%23Advanced%20Air%20Defence%20%28AAD%29/Ashwin%20Ballistic%20Missile%20Interceptor">Advanced Air Defence (AAD)</a> missile system was tested successfully. This missile is an Endo-atmospheric interceptor with an altitude of . In 2009, reports emerged of a new missile named the PDV. The DRDO is developing a new Prithvi interceptor missile code-named PDV. The PDV is designed to take out the target missile at altitudes above . The first PDV was successfully test fired on 27 April 2014. According to scientist V K Saraswat of <a href="DRDO">DRDO</a>, the missiles will work in tandem to ensure a hit probability of 99.8 percent. On 15 May 2016 India successfully launched advanced Defence interceptor missile named Ashvin interceptor missile from <a href="Abdul%20Kalam%20Island">Abdul Kalam Island</a> from Odisha coast.

The Arrow project was begun after the U.S. and Israel agreed to co-fund it on 6 May 1986.

The Arrow ABM system was designed and constructed in Israel with financial support by the United States by a multibillion-dollar development program called "Minhelet Homa" with the participation of companies like <a href="Israel%20Military%20Industries">Israel Military Industries</a>, <a href="Tadiran%20Telecom">Tadiran</a> and <a href="Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries">Israel Aerospace Industries</a>.

During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile. Designed to intercept incoming missiles travelling at up to 2 mile/s (3 km/s), the Arrow is expected to perform much better than the Patriot did in the Gulf War. On 29 July 2004 Israel and the United States carried out joint experiment in the USA, in which the Arrow was launched against a real Scud missile. The experiment was a success, as the Arrow destroyed the Scud with a direct hit. During December 2005 the system was deployed successfully in a test against a replicated <a href="Shahab-3">Shahab-3</a> missile. This feat was repeated on 11 February 2007.

The Arrow 3 system is capable of exo-atmosphere interception of ballistic missiles, including of <a href="ICBM">ICBM</a>s. It also act as an anti-satellite weapon.

Lieutenant General Patrick J. O'Reilly, Director of the US <a href="Missile%20Defense%20Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a>, said: "The design of Arrow 3 promises to be an extremely capable system, more advanced than what we have ever attempted in the U.S. with our programs."

On December 10, 2015 Arrow 3 scored its first intercept in a complex test designed to validate how the system can detect, identify, track and then discriminate real from decoy targets delivered into space by an improved <a href="Sparrow%20%28target%20missile%29">Silver Sparrow</a> target missile. According to officials, the milestone test paves the way toward <a href="Low%20rate%20initial%20production">low-rate initial production</a> of the Arrow 3.

David's Sling (Hebrew: קלע דוד), also sometimes called Magic Wand (Hebrew: שרביט קסמים), is an Israel Defense Forces military system being jointly developed by the Israeli defense contractor Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and the American defense contractor Raytheon, designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, as well as medium- to long-range rockets and slower-flying cruise missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah, fired at ranges from 40 km to 300 km. It is designed with the aim of intercepting the newest generation of tactical ballistic missiles, such as <a href="9K720%20Iskander">Iskander</a>.

Since 1998, when North Korea launched a <a href="Taepodong-1">Taepodong-1</a> missile over northern Japan, the Japanese have been jointly developing a new surface-to-air interceptor known as the Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) with the US. So far tests have been successful, and there are planned 11 locations that the PAC-3 will be installed. A military spokesman said that tests had been done on two sites, one of them a business park in central Tokyo, and Ichigaya – a site not far from the Imperial Palace.
Along with the PAC-3, Japan has installed a US-developed ship-based anti-ballistic missile system, which was tested successfully on 18 December 2007. The missile was launched from a Japanese warship, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast.

The Moscow ABM defense system was designed with the aim of being able to intercept the ICBM warheads aimed at Moscow and other important industrial regions, and is based on:

Apart from the main Moscow deployment, Russia has striven actively for intristic ABM capabilities of its SAM systems.


In several tests, the U.S. military have demonstrated the feasibility of destroying long and short range ballistic missiles. Combat effectiveness of newer systems against 1950s tactical ballistic missiles seems very high, as the <a href="MIM-104%20Patriot">MIM-104 Patriot</a> (PAC-1 and PAC-2) had a 100% success rate in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The U.S. Navy <a href="Aegis%20combat%20system">Aegis combat system</a> uses <a href="RIM-161%20Standard%20Missile%203">RIM-161 Standard Missile 3</a>, which hit a target going faster than ICBM warheads.

These systems, as opposed to U.S. GMD system, are not capable of a mid-course intercept of an ICBM.

The U.S. <a href="Terminal%20High%20Altitude%20Area%20Defense">Terminal High Altitude Area Defense</a> (THAAD) system began production in 2008. Its stated range as a short to intermediate ballistic missile interceptor means that it cannot hit ICBMs, which can reach <a href="Intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile%23Flight%20phases">terminal phase</a> speeds of mach 8 or greater.

The <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> released information as early as 2004 about their plans to develop a command system that was intended to replace <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>’s Patriot missile (SAM) program along with seven other forms of defense command systems. The system, the <a href="Integrated%20Air%20and%20Missile%20Battle%20Command%20System%20%28IBCS%29">Integrated Air and Missile Battle Command System (IBCS)</a>, is an <a href="anti-ballistic">anti-ballistic</a> missile defense system designed to shoot down short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase by intercepting with a hit-to-kill approach.

Procurement of <a href="MIM-104%20Patriot">MIM-104 Patriot</a> and indigenous <a href="Tien-Kung">Tien-Kung</a> anti-ballistic missile systems.

The idea of destroying rockets before they can hit their target dates from the first use of modern missiles in warfare, the German <a href="V-1%20%28flying%20bomb%29">V-1</a> and <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2</a> program of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

British fighters destroyed some V-1 "buzz bombs" in flight, although concentrated barrages of heavy anti-aircraft artillery had greater success. Under the lend-lease program, 200 US <a href="90%20mm%20Gun%20M1/M2/M3">90 mm AA</a> guns with <a href="SCR-584%20radar">SCR-584 radar</a>s and <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a>/<a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> computers were sent to the UK. These demonstrated a 95% success rate against V-1s that flew into their range.

The V-2, the first true ballistic missile, was impossible to destroy in the air. SCR-584's could be used to plot the trajectories of the missiles and provide some warning, but were more useful in backtracking their ballistic trajectory and determining the rough launch locations. The Allies launched <a href="Operation%20Crossbow">Operation Crossbow</a> to find and destroy V-2s before launch, but these operations were largely ineffective. In one instance a Spitfire happened upon a V-2 rising through the trees, and fired on it with no effect. This led to allied efforts to capture launching sites in Belgium and the Netherlands.

A wartime study by Bell Labs into the task of shooting down ballistic missiles in flight concluded it was not possible. In order to intercept a missile, one needs to be able to steer the attack onto the missile before it hits. A V-2's speed would require guns of effectively infinite reaction time, or some sort of weapon with ranges on the order of dozens of miles, neither of which appeared possible. This was, however, just before the emergence of high-speed computing systems. By the mid-1950s, things had changed considerably, and many forces worldwide were considering ABM systems.

The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II, as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear. But defences against Soviet long-range bombers took priority until 1957, when the Soviet Union demonstrated its advances in ICBM technology with the launch of <a href="Sputnik%20program">Sputnik</a>, the Earth's first artificial satellite. The <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> accelerated development of their <a href="LIM-49%20Nike%20Zeus">LIM-49 Nike Zeus</a> system in response. Zeus was criticized throughout its development program, especially from those within the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> and nuclear weapons establishments who suggested it would be much simpler to build more nuclear warheads and guarantee <a href="mutually%20assured%20destruction">mutually assured destruction</a>. Zeus was eventually cancelled in 1963.

In 1958, the U.S. sought to explore whether airbursting nuclear weapons might be used to ward off ICBMs. It conducted several test explosions of low-yield <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s — 1.7kt boosted fission <a href="W25%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W25 warhead</a>s — launched from ships to very high altitudes over the southern Atlantic Ocean. Such an explosion releases a burst of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s in the Earth's atmosphere, causing secondary showers of charged particles over an area hundreds of miles across. These can become trapped in the Earth' magnetic field, creating an artificial radiation belt. It was believed that this might be strong enough to damage warheads traveling through the layer. This proved not to be the case, but <a href="Operation%20Argus">Argus</a> returned key data about a related effect, the <a href="Nuclear%20electromagnetic%20pulse">Nuclear electromagnetic pulse</a> (NEMP).

Other countries were also involved in early ABM research. A more advanced project was at <a href="DRE%20Valcartier">CARDE</a> in Canada, which researched the main problems of ABM systems. A key problem with any radar system is that the signal is in the form of a cone, which spreads with distance from the transmitter. For long-distance interceptions like ABM systems, the inherent inaccuracy of the radar makes an interception difficult. CARDE considered using a <a href="terminal%20guidance">terminal guidance</a> system to address the accuracy concerns, and developed several advanced <a href="infrared">infrared</a> detectors for this role. They also studied a number of missile airframe designs, a new and much more powerful solid rocket fuel, and numerous systems for testing it all. After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended. One offshoot of the project was <a href="Gerald%20Bull">Gerald Bull</a>'s system for inexpensive high-speed testing, consisting of missile airframes shot from a <a href="sabot">sabot</a> round, which would later be the basis of <a href="Project%20HARP">Project HARP</a>. Another was the <a href="CRV7">CRV7</a> and <a href="Black%20Brant%20%28rocket%29">Black Brant</a> rockets, which used the new solid rocket fuel.

The Soviet military had requested funding for ABM research as early as 1953, but were only given the go-ahead to begin deployment of such a system on 17 August 1956. Their test system, known simply as System A, was based on the <a href="Fakel%20V-1000">V-1000</a> missile, which was similar to the early US efforts. The first successful test interception was carried out on 24 November 1960, and the first with a live warhead on 4 March 1961. In this test, a dummy warhead was released by a <a href="R-12%20%28missile%29">R-12</a> <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a> launched from the <a href="Kapustin%20Yar">Kapustin Yar</a>, and intercepted by a V-1000 launched from <a href="Sary-Shagan">Sary-Shagan</a>. The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 16,000 <a href="tungsten-carbide">tungsten-carbide</a> spherical <a href="impactors">impactors</a> 140 seconds after launch, at an altitude of .

The V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favour of nuclear-armed ABMs. A much larger missile, the <a href="ABM-1%20Galosh">Fakel 5V61</a> (known in the west as Galosh), was developed to carry the larger warhead and carry it much further from the launch site. Further development continued, and the <a href="A-35%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-35 anti-ballistic missile system</a>, designed to protect Moscow, became operational in 1971. A-35 was designed for exoatmospheric interceptions, and would have been highly susceptible to a well-arranged attack using multiple warheads and radar black-out techniques.

A-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system, the <a href="A-135%20anti-ballistic%20missile%20system">A-135</a>. The Gorgon (SH-11/ABM-4) long-range missile was designed to handle intercepts outside the atmosphere, and the <a href="53T6">Gazelle (SH-08/ABM-3)</a> short-range missile endoatmospheric intercepts that eluded Gorgon. The A-135 system is considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975.

<a href="Nike%20Zeus">Nike Zeus</a> failed to be a credible defence in an era of rapidly increasing ICBM counts due to its ability to attack only one target at a time. Additionally, significant concerns about its ability to successfully intercept warheads in the presence of high-altitude nuclear explosions, including its own, lead to the conclusion that the system would simply be too costly for the very low amount of protection it could provide.

By the time it was cancelled in 1963, potential upgrades had been explored for some time. Among these were radars capable of scanning much greater volumes of space and able to track many warheads and launch several missiles at once. These, however, did not address the problems identified with radar blackouts caused by high-altitude explosions. To address this need, a new missile with extreme performance was designed to attack incoming warheads at much lower altitudes, as low as 20 km. The new project encompassing all of these upgrades was launched as <a href="Nike-X">Nike-X</a>.

The main missile was <a href="LIM-49%20Spartan">LIM-49 Spartan</a>—a Nike Zeus upgraded for longer range and a much larger 5 megaton warhead intended to destroy enemy's warheads with a burst of x-rays outside the atmosphere. A second shorter-range missile called <a href="Sprint%20%28missile%29">Sprint</a> with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan. Sprint was a very fast missile (some sources claimed it accelerated to 8,000 mph (13 000 km/h) within 4 seconds of flight—an average acceleration of "90 <a href="g-force">g</a>") and had a smaller W66 <a href="Neutron%20bomb">enhanced radiation</a> warhead in the 1–3 kiloton range for in-atmosphere interceptions.

The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> administration to propose a thin ABM defense, that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States. In a September 1967 speech, Defense Secretary <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> referred to it as "Sentinel". McNamara, a private ABM opponent because of cost and feasibility (see <a href="cost-exchange%20ratio">cost-exchange ratio</a>), claimed that Sentinel would be directed not against the Soviet Union's missiles (since the <a href="Soviet%20Union">USSR</a> had more than enough missiles to overwhelm any American defense), but rather against the potential nuclear threat of the People's Republic of China.

In the meantime, a public debate over the merit of ABMs began. Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack. One problem was the <a href="Fractional%20Orbital%20Bombardment%20System">Fractional Orbital Bombardment System</a> (FOBS) that would give little warning to the defense. Another problem was high altitude EMP (whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads) which could degrade defensive radar systems.

When this proved infeasible for economic reasons, a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed, namely Safeguard (described later).

ABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large <a href="Intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">Intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s (ICBMs). The economics seemed simple enough; since rocket costs increase rapidly with size, the price of the ICBM launching a large warhead should always be greater than the much smaller interceptor missile needed to destroy it. In an arms race the defense would always win.

In practice, the price of the interceptor missile was considerable, due to its sophistication. The system had to be guided all the way to an interception, which demanded guidance and control systems that worked within and outside the atmosphere. The Nike Zeus was expected to cost about $1 million, about the same as an ICBM. However, due to their relatively short ranges, an ABM missile would be needed to counter an ICBM wherever it might be aimed. That implies that dozens of interceptors are needed for every ICBM. This led to intense debates about the "<a href="cost-exchange%20ratio">cost-exchange ratio</a>" between interceptors and warheads.

Conditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of <a href="Multiple%20independently%20targetable%20reentry%20vehicle">Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle</a> (MIRV) warheads. Suddenly, each launcher was throwing not one warhead, but several. These would spread out in space, ensuring that a single interceptor would be needed for each warhead. This simply added to the need to have several interceptors for each warhead in order to provide geographical coverage. Now it was clear that an ABM system would always be many times more expensive than the ICBMs they defended against.

Technical, economic and political problems described resulted in the <a href="Anti-Ballistic%20Missile%20Treaty">ABM treaty</a> of 1972, which restricted the deployment of strategic (not tactical) anti-ballistic missiles.

By the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision, each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single, small area. The Soviets retained their Moscow defences. The U.S. designated their ICBM sites near Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota, where Safeguard was already under advanced development. The radar systems and anti-ballistic missiles were approximately 90 miles north/northwest of Grand Forks AFB, near Concrete, North Dakota. The missiles were deactivated in 1975. The main radar site (PARCS) is still used as an early warning ICBM radar, facing relative north. It is located at Cavalier Air Force Station, North Dakota.

The U.S. <a href="Safeguard%20Program">Safeguard</a> system, which utilized the nuclear-tipped <a href="LIM-49A%20Spartan">LIM-49A Spartan</a> and <a href="Sprint%20%28missile%29">Sprint</a> missiles, in the short operational period of 1975/1976, was the second counter-ICBMs system in the world. Safeguard protected only the main fields of US ICBMs from attack, theoretically ensuring that an attack could be responded to with a US launch, enforcing the <a href="mutually%20assured%20destruction">mutually assured destruction</a> principle.

The <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan</a>-era <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> (often referred to as "Star Wars"), along with research into various energy-beam weaponry, brought new interest in the area of ABM technologies.

SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack. The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations, space-based relay mirrors, and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites. Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray <a href="laser">laser</a>s were not feasible with then-current technology. As research continued, SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system. SDI remained a research program and was never deployed. Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present <a href="Missile%20Defense%20Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a> (MDA).

Lasers originally developed for the SDI plan are in use for astronomical observations. Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere, they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments.

The Israeli <a href="Arrow%20%28Israeli%20missile%29">Arrow missile</a> system was tested initially during 1990, before the <a href="first%20Gulf%20War">first Gulf War</a>. The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s.

The <a href="Patriot%20missile">Patriot</a> was the first deployed tactical ABM system, although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations. It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi <a href="Scud">Scud</a> missiles. Post-war analyses show that the Patriot was much less effective than initially thought because of its radar and control system's inability to discriminate warheads from other objects when the Scud missiles broke up during reentry.
Testing ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success. After the Gulf War, improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems. A new Patriot, <a href="PAC-3">PAC-3</a>, was developed and tested—a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war, including a totally new missile.
The improved guidance, radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Patriot PAC-3s had a nearly 100% success rate against Iraqi TBMs fired. However, since no longer range Iraqi Scud missiles were used, PAC-3 effectiveness against those was untested. Patriot was involved in three <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incidents: two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery.

A new version of the Hawk missile was tested during the early to mid-1990s and by the end of 1998 the majority of US Marine Corps <a href="MIM-23%20Hawk">Hawk</a> systems were modified to support basic theater anti-ballistic missile capabilities. <a href="MIM-23%20Hawk">MIM-23 Hawk</a> missile is not operational in the U.S. service since 2002, but is used by many other countries.
Soon after the Gulf war, the <a href="Aegis%20combat%20system">Aegis combat system</a> was expanded to include ABM capabilities. The <a href="RIM-156%20Standard">Standard missile</a> system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception. During the late 1990s, SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense function. <a href="RIM-161%20Standard%20missile%203">Standard Missile 3 (SM-3)</a> systems have also been tested for an ABM role. In 2008, an SM-3 missile launched from a <a href="Ticonderoga-class%20cruiser">"Ticonderoga"-class cruiser</a>, the <a href="USS%20Lake%20Erie%20%28CG-70%29">USS Lake Erie</a>, successfully intercepted <a href="USA-193">a non-functioning satellite</a>.

From 1992 to 2000, a demonstration system for the US Army <a href="Terminal%20High%20Altitude%20Area%20Defense">Terminal High Altitude Area Defense</a> was deployed at <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a>. Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures, but successful intercepts occurred from 1999 onward. The US Army is in the process of fielding THAAD line batteries.

Approved for acquisition by the Pentagon during 1991 but never realized, <a href="Brilliant%20Pebbles">Brilliant Pebbles</a> was a proposed space-based anti-ballistic system that was meant to avoid some of the problems of the earlier SDI concepts. Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites, Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small, intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads. The system relied on improvements of computer technology, avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky, expensive development of large, complicated space defense satellites.
It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk.

The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting. Rather than rely exclusively on ground-based control, the many small interceptors would cooperatively communicate among themselves and target a large swarm of ICBM warheads in space or in the late boost phase. Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense.

While the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative was intended to shield against a massive Soviet attack, during the early 1990s, President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> called for a more limited version using rocket-launched interceptors based on the ground at a single site. Such system was developed since 1992, was expected to become operational in 2010 and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs. First called the National Missile Defense (NMD), since 2002 it was renamed <a href="Ground-Based%20Midcourse%20Defense">Ground-Based Midcourse Defense</a> (GMD). It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack. The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or accidental launches from Russia or China, but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East. The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, by ground-based missiles in other locations, or by the <a href="Boeing%20YAL-1">Boeing Airborne Laser</a>.

During 1998, Defense secretary <a href="William%20Cohen">William Cohen</a> proposed spending an additional $6.6 billion on intercontinental ballistic missile defense programs to build a system to protect against attacks from North Korea or accidental launches from Russia or China.

In terms of organization, during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). In 2002, it was renamed to <a href="Missile%20Defense%20Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a> (MDA).

On 13 June 2002, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and recommenced developing missile defense systems that would have formerly been prohibited by the bilateral treaty. The action was stated as needed to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a <a href="rogue%20state">rogue state</a>.

The next day, the Russian Federation dropped the <a href="START%20II">START II</a> agreement, intended to completely ban <a href="MIRV">MIRV</a>s.

On 15 December 2016, the US Army <a href="SMDC">SMDC</a> had a successful test of a U.S. Army Zombie Pathfinder rocket, to be used as a target for exercising various anti-ballistic missile scenarios. The rocket was launched as part of NASA's <a href="sounding%20rocket">sounding rocket</a> program, at White Sands Missile Range.

Acre

The acre is a <a href="Units%20of%20measurement">unit</a> of land area used in the <a href="Imperial%20units">imperial</a> and <a href="United%20States%20customary%20units%23Units%20of%20area">US customary</a> systems. It is defined as the area of 1 <a href="Chain%20%28unit%29">chain</a> by 1 <a href="furlong">furlong</a> (66 by 660 <a href="Foot%20%28unit%29">feet</a>), which is exactly equal to of a <a href="square%20mile">square mile</a>, 43,560 square feet, approximately 4,047 m, or about 40% of a <a href="hectare">hectare</a>.

The acre is commonly used in <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>, <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a>, <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>, the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>, the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>, <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>, <a href="St.%20Lucia">St. Lucia</a>, <a href="St.%20Helena">St. Helena</a>, <a href="St.%20Kitts%20and%20Nevis">St. Kitts and Nevis</a>, <a href="St.%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">St. Vincent and the Grenadines</a>, <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos">Turks and Caicos</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and the <a href="US%20Virgin%20Islands">US Virgin Islands</a>.

The international symbol of the acre is ac. The most commonly used acre today is the international acre. In the United States both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but differ by only two parts per million; see below. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. One international acre is defined as exactly  square metres.

An acre was defined in the Middle Ages as the amount of land that could be <a href="plough">plough</a>ed in one day by a yoke of oxen.

One acre equals 0.0015625 square miles, 4,840 square yards, 43,560 <a href="Square%20foot">square feet</a> or about (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based. Originally, an acre was understood as a <a href="selion">selion</a> of land sized at forty <a href="Rod%20%28unit%29">perches</a> (660 ft, or 1 <a href="furlong">furlong</a>) long and four perches (66 ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land a yoke of oxen could plough in one day. A <a href="square">square</a> enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or on a side. As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any area of 43,560 square feet is an acre.

In the <a href="international%20yard%20and%20pound">international yard and pound</a> agreement of 1959 the United States and five countries of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> defined the international yard to be exactly 0.9144 metres. Consequently, the international acre is exactly  square metres.

Both the international acre and the US survey acre contain of a square mile or 4,840 square yards, but alternative definitions of a yard are used (see <a href="Foot%20%28unit%29%23Survey%20foot">survey foot</a> and <a href="Yard%23Conversions">survey yard</a>), so the exact size of an acre depends upon which yard it is based. The US survey acre is about square metres; its exact value ( m) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37 inches exactly, as established by the <a href="Mendenhall%20Order">Mendenhall Order</a>. Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet, and consequently, both varieties of acre.

Since the difference between the US survey acre and international acre is only about a quarter of the size of an A4 sheet of paper (0.016 square metres, 160 square centimetres or 24.8 square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed. Areas are seldom measured with sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable.

In India, residential plots are measured in <a href="cent%20%28area%29">cents</a> or <a href="Decimal%20%28unit%29">decimal</a>, which is one hundredth of an acre, or . In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 <a href="Perch%20%28unit%29">perches</a> or 4 <a href="Rood%20%28measurement%29">roods</a> is common.

1 international acre is equal to the following metric units:

1 United States survey acre is equal to:

1 acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:

Perhaps the easiest way for US residents to envisage an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88 yards by 55 yards ( of 880 yards by of 880 yards), about the size of a standard <a href="American%20football%20field">American football field</a>. To be more exact, one acre is 90.75% of a 100-yd-long by 53.33-yd-wide American football field (without the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>s). The full field, including the end zones, covers about .

For residents of other countries, the acre might be envisaged as approximately half of a 105-m-long by 68-m-wide <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">association football (soccer) pitch</a>.

It may also be remembered as 44,000 square feet, less 1%.

The word "acre" is derived from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> originally meaning "open field", <a href="cognate">cognate</a> to west coast Norwegian and <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a> , <a href="German%20language">German</a> , <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> , <a href="Latin">Latin</a> , <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> , and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> (). In English, it was historically spelled "<a href="wikt%3Aaker">aker</a>".

The acre was roughly the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day. This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one <a href="chain%20%28length%29">chain</a> and one <a href="furlong">furlong</a>. A long, narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word "furlong" itself derives from the fact that it is one <a href="Plough">furrow</a> long.

Before the enactment of the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres, whereas in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> as many variants of "acre" existed as there were German states.

Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, <a href="Rood%20%28measurement%29">rood</a>s, and <a href="Perch%20%28unit%29">perches</a>), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.

The acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile. One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards). In western Canada and the western United States, divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof. If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of mile (880 yards) and is square mile in area, or 160 acres. These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being mile long, and being of a square mile in area, or 40 acres. In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase "the back 40" would refer to the 40-acre parcel to the back of the farm. Most of the <a href="Canadian%20Prairie%20Provinces">Canadian Prairie Provinces</a> and the US Midwest are on square-mile grids for surveying purposes.

ATP may refer to:

<doc id="1800" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1800" title="Adenosine triphosphate">
Adenosine triphosphate

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a complex <a href="organic%20compound">organic chemical</a> that participates in many processes. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the "molecular unit of <a href="currency">currency</a>" of intracellular <a href="energy%20transfer">energy transfer</a>. When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts to either the di- or monophosphates, respectively ADP and AMP. Other processes regenerate ATP such that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA.

From the perspective of <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, ATP is classified as <a href="nucleoside%20triphosphate">nucleoside triphosphate</a>, which indicates that it consists of three components, a nitrogenous base (adenine), the sugar ribose, and the triphosphate. It is used in <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> as a <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a>.

In terms of its structure, ATP consists of an <a href="adenine">adenine</a> attached by the 9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar (<a href="ribose">ribose</a>), which in turn is attached at the 5′ carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> and <a href="adenosine%20monophosphate">AMP</a>. The three phosphoryl groups are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ). 

In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP, with a small proportion of ATP. 

Being polyanionic and featuring a potentially <a href="chelation">chelatable</a> polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The <a href="binding%20constant">binding constant</a> for is (). The binding of a <a href="divalent">divalent</a> <a href="cation">cation</a>, almost always <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, strongly affects the interaction of ATP with various proteins Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers.

A second magnesium ion is critical for ATP binding in the kinase domain. The presence of Mg regulates kinase activity.

Salts of ATP can be isolated as colorless solids.

ATP is stable in aqueous solutions between pH 6.8 and 7.4, but it is rapidly <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysed</a> at more extreme pH's. ATP <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyses</a> to <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP.

The hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate releases 30.5 <a href="joule%20per%20mole">kJ/mol</a> of enthalpy, with a change in <a href="Thermodynamic%20free%20energy">free energy</a> of 3.4 kJ/mol. The energy released by cleaving either a phosphate (P) or pyrophosphate (PP) unit from ATP at <a href="standard%20state">standard state</a> of 1 M are:

These abbreviated equations can be written more explicitly (R = <a href="adenosine">adenosyl</a>):

With a typical intracellular <a href="concentration">concentration</a> of 1–10 <a href="molarity">mM</a>, ATP is abundant. The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s are (1) <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, (2) the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>/<a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>, and (3) <a href="beta-oxidation">beta-oxidation</a>. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, the combination of pathways 1 and 2, is known as <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a>, produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose. 

ATP production by a non-<a href="photosynthetic">photosynthetic</a> aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.

In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a>. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through <a href="substrate-level%20phosphorylation">substrate phosphorylation</a> catalyzed by two enzymes, <a href="Phosphoglycerate%20kinase">PGK</a> and <a href="pyruvate%20kinase">pyruvate kinase</a>. Two equivalents of <a href="NADH">NADH</a> are also produced, which can be oxidized via the <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a> and result in the generation of additional ATP by <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a>. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">Krebs Cycle</a>.

In glycolysis, <a href="hexokinase">hexokinase</a> is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and <a href="pyruvate%20kinase">pyruvate kinase</a> is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is <a href="phosphofructokinase">phosphofructokinase</a> (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a <a href="tetramer%20protein">tetramer</a> that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two <a href="binding%20site">binding site</a>s for ATP – the <a href="active%20site">active site</a> is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including <a href="cyclic%20AMP">cyclic AMP</a>, <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.
In the <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondrion</a>, pyruvate is oxidized by the <a href="pyruvate%20dehydrogenase%20complex">pyruvate dehydrogenase complex</a> to the <a href="acetyl">acetyl</a> group, which is fully oxidized to <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> by the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a> (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every "turn" of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP <a href="guanosine%20triphosphate">guanosine triphosphate</a> (GTP) through <a href="substrate-level%20phosphorylation">substrate-level phosphorylation</a> catalyzed by <a href="succinyl-CoA%20synthetase">succinyl-CoA synthetase</a>, three molecules of <a href="NADH">NADH</a>, and one equivalent of <a href="Flavin%20group">FADH</a>. NADH and FADH are recycled to (NAD and <a href="Flavin%20adenine%20dinucleotide">FAD</a>, respectively), generating additional ATP by <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP. The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, it is an obligately <a href="aerobic%20glycolysis">aerobic</a> process because O is used to recycle the NADH and FADH. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the <a href="malate-aspartate%20shuttle">malate-aspartate shuttle</a> (and to a lesser extent, the <a href="glycerol-phosphate%20shuttle">glycerol-phosphate shuttle</a>) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a <a href="malate%20dehydrogenase">malate dehydrogenase</a> enzyme converts <a href="oxaloacetate">oxaloacetate</a> to <a href="malate">malate</a>, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD. A <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a> converts the oxaloacetate to <a href="aspartate">aspartate</a> for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH through the electron transport chain pumps <a href="proton">proton</a>s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a <a href="proton%20motive%20force">proton motive force</a> that is the net effect of a <a href="pH">pH</a> gradient and an <a href="electric%20potential">electric potential</a> gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix – yields ATP by <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a>.

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an <a href="antiporter">antiporter</a>, the <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a>/ATP translocase, which is an <a href="integral%20membrane%20protein">integral membrane protein</a> used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.

The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD to NADH and the concentrations of <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, inorganic phosphate, ATP, <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a>, and AMP. <a href="Citrate">Citrate</a> – the molecule that gives its name to the cycle – is a feedback inhibitor of <a href="citrate%20synthase">citrate synthase</a> and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.

In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are degraded to <a href="acetyl-CoA">acetyl-CoA</a>. The pathway is called <a href="beta-oxidation">beta-oxidation</a>. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of NADH and one FADH. The NADH and FADH are used to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain. The acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation can be subsequently metabolized by the citric acid cycle, yielding further equivalents of ATP.

In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by <a href="cytochrome%20c%20oxidase">cytochrome c oxidase</a>, which is regulated by the availability of its substrate – the reduced form of <a href="cytochrome%20c">cytochrome c</a>. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:
which directly implies this equation:

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD] or a high ratio of [ADP][P] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity. An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.

<a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">Fermentation</a> is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves <a href="substrate-level%20phosphorylation">substrate-level phosphorylation</a> in the absence of a respiratory <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a> is:

<a href="Anaerobic%20respiration">Anaerobic respiration</a> is respiration in the absence of . Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>, and carbon dioxide.

ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called "replenishment" reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of <a href="nucleoside%20diphosphate%20kinase">nucleoside diphosphate kinase</a>s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the family.

In plants, ATP is synthesized in the <a href="thylakoid%20membrane">thylakoid membrane</a> of the <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>. The process is called photophosphorylation. The "machinery" is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation. Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the <a href="Calvin%20cycle">Calvin cycle</a>, which produces <a href="triose">triose</a> sugars.

The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.2 <a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">mole</a>s. The majority of ATP is recycled from <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">ADP</a> remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells requires the <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> of 100 to 150 moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75 kg. A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 500-750 times during a single day ().

ATP is involved <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a> by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups. Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins. They share a small number of common folds. <a href="Phosphorylation">Phosphorylation</a> of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the <a href="mitogen-activated%20protein%20kinase">mitogen-activated protein kinase</a> cascade.

ATP is also a substrate of <a href="adenylate%20cyclase">adenylate cyclase</a>, most commonly in <a href="G%20protein%E2%80%93coupled%20receptor">G protein-coupled receptor</a> signal transduction pathways and is transformed to <a href="second%20messenger">second messenger</a>, cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.

ATP is one of four "monomers" required in the synthesis of <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. The process is promoted by <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a>s. A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the <a href="deoxyribonucleotide">deoxyribonucleotide</a> dATP. Like many condensation reactions in nature, <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a> and <a href="DNA%20transcription">DNA transcription</a> also consumes ATP.

<a href="Aminoacyl-tRNA%20synthetase">Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase</a> enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps:


The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration).
Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis. Transport is mediated by <a href="ATP%20binding%20cassette%20transporter">ATP binding cassette transporter</a>s. The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds.

Biochemistry laboratories often use "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. <a href="Enzyme%20inhibitor">Enzyme inhibitor</a>s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as <a href="kinase">kinase</a>s are needed to examine the <a href="binding%20site">binding site</a>s and <a href="transition%20state">transition state</a>s involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> to determine a <a href="protein%20structure">protein structure</a> in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.
Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound <a href="vanadate">vanadate</a> ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.

ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann, and independently by Cyrus Fiske and <a href="Yellapragada%20Subbarow">Yellapragada Subbarow</a> of <a href="Harvard%20Medical%20School">Harvard Medical School</a>, but its correct structure was not determined until some years later. It was proposed to be the intermediary between energy-yielding and energy-requiring reactions in cells by <a href="Fritz%20Albert%20Lipmann">Fritz Albert Lipmann</a> in 1941. It was first synthesized in the laboratory by <a href="Alexander%20R.%20Todd%2C%20Baron%20Todd">Alexander Todd</a> in 1948.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics (From <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> αντιβιοτικά, "antiviotika)" also called antibacterials, are a type of <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> <a href="pharmaceutical%20drug">drug</a> used in the <a href="therapy">treatment</a> and <a href="antibiotic%20prophylaxis">prevention</a> of <a href="pathogenic%20bacteria">bacterial infection</a>s. They <a href="bactericide">may either kill</a> or <a href="bacteriostatic%20agent">inhibit the growth</a> of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. A limited number of antibiotics also possess <a href="antiprotozoal">antiprotozoal</a> activity. Antibiotics are not effective against <a href="virus">virus</a>es such as the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> or <a href="influenza">influenza</a>; drugs which inhibit viruses are termed <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s or antivirals rather than antibiotics.

Sometimes the term antibiotic (which means "opposing life") is used to refer to any substance used against <a href="microbe">microbe</a>s, synonymous with antimicrobial. Some sources distinguish between antibacterial and antibiotic; antibacterials are used in <a href="antibacterial%20soap">soaps</a> and <a href="disinfectant">disinfectant</a>s, while antibiotics are used as medicine.

Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. Together with <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a>, antibiotics have led to the near eradication of diseases such as <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in the developed world. However, their effectiveness and easy access have also led to their <a href="antibiotic%20misuse">overuse</a>, prompting bacteria to develop <a href="antimicrobial%20resistance">resistance</a>. This has led to widespread problems, so much as to prompt the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> to classify antimicrobial resistance as a "serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country".

Substances with antibiotic properties had been used for various purposes since ancient times.
Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on <a href="folk%20medicine">medicinal folklore</a>. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20medicine">ancient Egyptians</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20medicine">ancient Greeks</a>, used specially selected <a href="mold">mold</a> and plant materials and extracts to treat <a href="infection">infection</a>s. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> observed, "if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics".

In 1874, physician Sir <a href="William%20Roberts%20%28physician%29">William Roberts</a> noted that cultures of the mold "<a href="Penicillium%20glaucum">Penicillium glaucum</a>" that is used in the making of some types of <a href="blue%20cheese">blue cheese</a> did not display bacterial contamination. In 1876, physicist <a href="John%20Tyndall">John Tyndall</a> also contributed to this field. Pasteur conducted research showing that "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>" would not grow in the presence of the related mold "<a href="Penicillium%20notatum">Penicillium notatum</a>".

In 1895 <a href="Vincenzo%20Tiberio">Vincenzo Tiberio</a>, Itallian physician, published a paper on the antibacterial power of some extracts of mold.

In 1897, doctoral student <a href="Ernest%20Duchesne">Ernest Duchesne</a> submitted a dissertation, "Contribution à l'étude de la concurrence vitale chez les micro-organismes: antagonisme entre les moisissures et les microbes" (Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between molds and microbes), the first known scholarly work to consider the therapeutic capabilities of molds resulting from their anti-microbial activity. In his thesis, Duchesne proposed that bacteria and molds engage in a perpetual battle for survival. Duchesne observed that "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" was eliminated by "Penicillium glaucum" when they were both grown in the same culture. He also observed that when he <a href="Inoculation">inoculated</a> laboratory animals with lethal doses of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> bacilli together with "Penicillium glaucum", the animals did not contract typhoid. Unfortunately Duchesne's army service after getting his degree prevented him from doing any further research. Duchesne died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, a disease now treated by antibiotics.

In 1928, Sir <a href="Alexander%20Fleming">Alexander Fleming</a> identified <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>, a molecule produced by certain molds that kills or stops the growth of certain kinds of bacteria. Fleming was working on a culture of <a href="pathogen">disease-causing</a> bacteria when he noticed the <a href="spore">spore</a>s of a green mold, "<a href="Penicillium%20chrysogenum">Penicillium chrysogenum</a>", in one of his <a href="agar%20plate">culture plates</a>. He observed that the presence of the mold killed or prevented the growth of the bacteria. Fleming postulated that the mold must secrete an antibacterial substance, which he named penicillin in 1928. Fleming believed that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.

<a href="Ernst%20Chain">Ernst Chain</a>, <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Edward%20Abraham">Edward Abraham</a> succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, <a href="penicillin%20G">penicillin G</a>, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, <a href="Norman%20Heatley">Norman Heatley</a> developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942 and then later confirmed by <a href="Dorothy%20Crowfoot%20Hodgkin">Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin</a> in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic <a href="sulfonamides">sulfonamides</a>. (see below) The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> with Fleming.

Florey credited <a href="Rene%20Dubos">Rene Dubos</a> with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin. In 1939, coinciding with the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Dubos had reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, <a href="tyrothricin">tyrothricin</a>, a compound of 20% <a href="gramicidin">gramicidin</a> and 80% <a href="tyrocidine">tyrocidine</a>, from "B. brevis." It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II. Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> and the <a href="Allied%20powers%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied powers</a> during World War II and limited access during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a> in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, in 1907, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the first synthetic antibacterial <a href="salvarsan">salvarsan</a> now called arsphenamine.

The era of antibacterial treatment began with the discoveries of arsenic-derived synthetic antibiotics by <a href="Alfred%20Bertheim">Alfred Bertheim</a> and Ehrlich in 1907. Ehrlich and Bertheim experimented with various chemicals derived from dyes to treat <a href="trypanosomiasis">trypanosomiasis</a> in mice and <a href="spirochaeta">spirochaeta</a> infection in rabbits. While their early compounds were too toxic, Ehrlich and <a href="Sahachiro%20Hata">Sahachiro Hata</a>, a Japanese bacteriologist working with Erlich in the quest for a drug to treat <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, achieved success with the 606th compound in their series of experiments. In 1910 Ehrlich and Hata announced their discovery, which they called drug "606", at the Congress for Internal Medicine at <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>. The <a href="Hoechst%20AG">Hoechst</a> company began to market the compound toward the end of 1910 under the name Salvarsan. This drug is now known as <a href="arsphenamine">arsphenamine</a>. The drug was used to treat syphilis in the first half of the 20th century. In 1908, Ehrlich received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for his contributions to <a href="immunology">immunology</a>. Hata was nominated for the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 1911 and for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1912 and 1913.

The first <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamide</a> and the first <a href="wikt%3Asystemic">systemically</a> active antibacterial drug, <a href="Prontosil">Prontosil</a>, was developed by a research team led by <a href="Gerhard%20Domagk">Gerhard Domagk</a> in 1932 or 1933 at the <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a> Laboratories of the <a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> conglomerate in Germany, for which Domagk received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Sulfanilamide, the active drug of Prontosil, was not patentable as it had already been in use in the dye industry for some years. Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> <a href="Coccus">cocci</a>, but not against <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">enterobacteria</a>. Research was stimulated apace by its success. The discovery and development of this sulfonamide <a href="drug">drug</a> opened the era of antibacterials.

Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections, and sometimes <a href="protozoan%20infection">protozoan infection</a>s. (<a href="Metronidazole">Metronidazole</a> is effective against a number of <a href="parasitic%20disease">parasitic disease</a>s). When an infection is suspected of being responsible for an illness but the responsible pathogen has not been identified, an <a href="empiric%20therapy">empiric therapy</a> is adopted. This involves the administration of a <a href="broad-spectrum%20antibiotic">broad-spectrum antibiotic</a> based on the signs and symptoms presented and is initiated pending laboratory results that can take several days.

When the responsible pathogenic microorganism is already known or has been identified, <a href="therapy%23Definitive%20therapy">definitive therapy</a> can be started. This will usually involve the use of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The choice of antibiotic given will also be based on its cost. Identification is critically important as it can reduce the cost and toxicity of the antibiotic therapy and also reduce the possibility of the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. To avoid surgery, antibiotics may be given for non-complicated acute <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>.
Antibiotics may be given as a <a href="preventive%20healthcare">preventive measure</a> (prophylactic) and this is usually limited to at-risk populations such as those with a <a href="immunodeficiency">weakened immune system</a> (particularly in <a href="HIV">HIV</a> cases to prevent <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>), those taking <a href="immunosuppressive%20drug">immunosuppressive drug</a>s, <a href="cancer">cancer</a> patients and those having <a href="surgery">surgery</a>. Their use in surgical procedures is to help prevent infection of <a href="surgical%20incision">incisions</a> made. They have an important role in <a href="dental%20antibiotic%20prophylaxis">dental antibiotic prophylaxis</a> where their use may prevent <a href="bacteremia">bacteremia</a> and consequent <a href="infective%20endocarditis">infective endocarditis</a>. Antibiotics are also used to prevent infection in cases of <a href="neutropenia">neutropenia</a> particularly cancer-related.

There are different <a href="routes%20of%20administration">routes of administration</a> for antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics are usually <a href="oral%20administration">taken by mouth</a>. In more severe cases, particularly deep-seated <a href="systemic%20disease">systemic infection</a>s, antibiotics can be given <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenously</a> or by injection. Where the site of infection is easily accessed, antibiotics may be given <a href="routes%20of%20administration%23Topical">topically</a> in the form of <a href="eye%20drop">eye drop</a>s onto the <a href="conjunctiva">conjunctiva</a> for <a href="conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</a> or <a href="ear%20drop">ear drop</a>s for ear infections and acute cases of <a href="otitis%20externa">swimmer's ear</a>. Topical use is also one of the treatment options for some skin conditions including <a href="acne%20vulgaris">acne</a> and <a href="cellulitis">cellulitis</a>. Advantages of topical application include achieving high and sustained concentration of antibiotic at the site of infection; reducing the potential for systemic absorption and toxicity, and total volumes of antibiotic required are reduced, thereby also reducing the risk of antibiotic misuse. Topical antibiotics applied over certain types of surgical wounds have been reported to reduce the risk of surgical site infections. However, there are certain general causes for concern with topical administration of antibiotics. Some systemic absorption of the antibiotic may occur; the quantity of antibiotic applied is difficult to accurately dose, and there is also the possibility of local <a href="hypersensitivity">hypersensitivity</a> reactions or <a href="contact%20dermatitis">contact dermatitis</a> occurring.

Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects before their approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and well tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a wide extent of adverse <a href="side%20effect">side effect</a>s ranging from mild to very severe depending on the type of antibiotic used, the microbes targeted, and the individual patient. Side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity or <a href="allergy">allergic</a> reactions. Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including <a href="photodermatitis">photodermatitis</a> and <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>. Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use.
Common side-effects include <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, resulting from disruption of the species composition in the <a href="intestinal%20flora">intestinal flora</a>, resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as "<a href="Clostridium%20difficile%20%28bacteria%29">Clostridium difficile</a>". Antibacterials can also affect the <a href="vaginal%20flora">vaginal flora</a>, and may lead to overgrowth of <a href="yeast">yeast</a> species of the genus "<a href="Candida%20%28genus%29">Candida</a>" in the vulvo-vaginal area. Additional side-effects can result from <a href="drug%20interaction">interaction</a> with other drugs, such as the possibility of <a href="tendon">tendon</a> damage from the administration of a <a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolone antibiotic</a> with a systemic <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a>.

Exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models. Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the <a href="Gut%20flora">intestinal microbiota</a> and for <a href="Metabolism">metabolic</a> development. Mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment (STAT)– with either penicillin, <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, or <a href="chlortetracycline">chlortetracycline</a> had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities. One study has reported that mice given low-dose penicillin (1 μg/g body weight) around birth and throughout the <a href="weaning">weaning</a> process had an increased body mass and fat mass, accelerated growth, and increased <a href="hepatic">hepatic</a> expression of <a href="gene">gene</a>s involved in <a href="adipogenesis">adipogenesis</a>, compared to control mice. In addition, penicillin in combination with a high-fat diet increased fasting <a href="insulin">insulin</a> levels in mice. However, it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause <a href="obesity">obesity</a> in humans. Studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics (<6 months) and increased body mass (at 10 and 20 months). Another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given <a href="macrolide">macrolide</a>s compared to penicillin and <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>. Therefore, there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans, but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear. Although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity, the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy.

Well controlled studies on the effect of <a href="oral%20contraceptive%20pill">oral contraceptive</a> failure and antibiotics are very limited. The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with <a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill">birth control pill</a>s, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%). Situations that may increase the risk of oral contraceptive failure include <a href="Compliance%20%28medicine%29">non-compliance</a> (missing taking the pill), vomiting or diarrhea. Gastrointestinal disorders or interpatient variability in oral contraceptive absorption affecting <a href="ethinylestradiol">ethinylestradiol</a> <a href="Serum%20%28blood%29">serum levels</a> in the blood. Women with <a href="Irregular%20menstruation">menstrual irregularities</a> may be at higher risk of failure and should be advised to use <a href="Contraception">backup contraception</a> during antibiotic treatment and for one week after its completion. If patient-specific risk factors for reduced oral contraceptive efficacy are suspected, backup contraception is recommended.

In cases where antibiotics have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibiotic <a href="rifampicin">rifampicin</a>, these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients. Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>s in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial. Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibiotics that are suspected to interact with oral <a href="contraceptives">contraceptives</a>. More studies on the possible interactions between antibiotics and birth control pills (oral contraceptives) are required as well as careful assessment of patient-specific risk factors for potential oral contractive pill failure prior to dismissing the need for backup contraception.

Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. While moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects. Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered.

Antibiotics such as <a href="metronidazole">metronidazole</a>, <a href="tinidazole">tinidazole</a>, <a href="cephamandole">cephamandole</a>, <a href="latamoxef">latamoxef</a>, <a href="cefoperazone">cefoperazone</a>, <a href="cefmenoxime">cefmenoxime</a>, and <a href="furazolidone">furazolidone</a>, cause a <a href="disulfiram">disulfiram</a>-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by <a href="acetaldehyde%20dehydrogenase">acetaldehyde dehydrogenase</a>, which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath. In addition, the efficacy of doxycycline and <a href="erythromycin">erythromycin</a> succinate may be reduced by alcohol consumption. Other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound.

The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include <a href="Immune%20system">host defense mechanisms</a>, the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial. A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells. These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection. Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration, "in vitro" characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the <a href="minimum%20inhibitory%20concentration">minimum inhibitory concentration</a> and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.
To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its <a href="Pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetic</a> profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.

In important infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, <a href="combination%20therapy">combination therapy</a> (i.e., the concurrent application of two or more antibiotics) has been used to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance. In acute bacterial infections, antibiotics as part of combination therapy are prescribed for their <a href="Drug%20synergy">synergistic</a> effects to improve treatment outcome as the combined effect of both antibiotics is better than their individual effect. <a href="Methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</a> infections may be treated with a combination therapy of <a href="fusidic%20acid">fusidic acid</a> and rifampicin. Antibiotics used in combination may also be antagonistic and the combined effects of the two antibiotics may be less than if the individual antibiotic was given as part of a <a href="monotherapy">monotherapy</a>. For example, <a href="chloramphenicol">chloramphenicol</a> and <a href="tetracyclines">tetracyclines</a> are antagonists to <a href="penicillins">penicillins</a> and <a href="aminoglycosides">aminoglycosides</a>. However, this can vary depending on the species of bacteria. In general, combinations of a bacteriostatic antibiotic and bactericidal antibiotic are antagonistic.

Antibiotics are commonly classified based on their <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a>, <a href="chemical%20structure">chemical structure</a>, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (<a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s and <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s) or the cell membrane (<a href="polymyxin">polymyxin</a>s), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (<a href="rifamycin">rifamycin</a>s, <a href="lipiarmycin">lipiarmycin</a>s, <a href="Quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolones</a>, and <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamides</a>) have <a href="Bactericide">bactericidal</a> activities. <a href="Protein%20synthesis%20inhibitor">Protein synthesis inhibitor</a>s (<a href="macrolide">macrolide</a>s, <a href="lincosamides">lincosamides</a> and <a href="tetracycline">tetracycline</a>s) are usually <a href="bacteriostatic">bacteriostatic</a> (with the exception of bactericidal <a href="aminoglycoside">aminoglycoside</a>s). Further categorization is based on their target specificity. "Narrow-spectrum" antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as <a href="gram-negative">gram-negative</a> or <a href="gram-positive">gram-positive</a>, whereas <a href="broad-spectrum%20antibiotics">broad-spectrum antibiotics</a> affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year break in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic <a href="lipopeptide">lipopeptide</a>s (such as <a href="daptomycin">daptomycin</a>), <a href="glycylcyclines">glycylcyclines</a> (such as <a href="tigecycline">tigecycline</a>), <a href="oxazolidinone">oxazolidinone</a>s (such as <a href="linezolid">linezolid</a>), and <a href="lipiarmycin">lipiarmycin</a>s (such as <a href="fidaxomicin">fidaxomicin</a>).

With advances in <a href="medicinal%20chemistry">medicinal chemistry</a>, most modern antibacterials are <a href="semisynthetic">semisynthetic</a> modifications of various natural compounds. These include, for example, the <a href="beta-lactam%20antibiotics">beta-lactam antibiotics</a>, which include the <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s (produced by fungi in the genus "<a href="Penicillium">Penicillium</a>"), the <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s, and the <a href="carbapenem">carbapenem</a>s. Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the <a href="aminoglycoside">aminoglycoside</a>s, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamides</a>, the <a href="Quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolones</a>, and the <a href="oxazolidinone">oxazolidinone</a>s—are produced solely by <a href="chemical%20synthesis">chemical synthesis</a>. Many antibacterial compounds are relatively <a href="small%20molecule">small molecule</a>s with a <a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a> of less than 1000 <a href="dalton%20%28unit%29">dalton</a>s.

Since the first pioneering efforts of <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Boris%20Chain">Chain</a> in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to <a href="medicine">medicine</a> has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using <a href="Industrial%20fermentation">fermentation</a>, usually in strongly aerobic conditions.

The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may <a href="Natural%20selection">select</a> for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the <a href="Luria%E2%80%93Delbr%C3%BCck%20experiment">Luria–Delbrück experiment</a>. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.

Resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance, but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing <a href="biological%20fitness">fitness</a> of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms. Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial <a href="genome">genome</a>. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by <a href="Horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal genetic exchange</a>. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via <a href="plasmids">plasmids</a> that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as "superbugs", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of <a href="multidrug-resistant%20tuberculosis">multidrug-resistant tuberculosis</a> (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide. For example, <a href="NDM-1">NDM-1</a> is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of <a href="beta-lactam">beta-lactam</a> antibacterials. The United Kingdom's <a href="Health%20Protection%20Agency">Health Protection Agency</a> has stated that "most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections." On 26 May 2016 an <a href="Escherichia%20coli">E coli bacteria</a> "<a href="Antimicrobial%20resistance">superbug</a>" was identified in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> resistant to <a href="colistin">colistin</a>, <a href="Drug%20of%20last%20resort">"the last line of defence" antibiotic</a>.

Per "The ICU pageRank.Book" "The first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them." Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <a href="Self-prescribing">Self prescription</a> of antibiotics is an example of misuse. Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also, incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections. The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s. Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of <a href="prophylaxis">prophylactic</a> antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>. One study on <a href="respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory tract infection</a>s found "physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them". Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics. The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the US Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), and the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH), as well as other US agencies. An NGO campaign group is "Keep Antibiotics Working". In France, an "Antibiotics are not automatic" government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially in children.

The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003. Moreover, several organizations (including the World Health Organization, the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>, and the <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a>) have advocated restricting the amount of antibiotic use in food animal production. However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed. These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).

Despite pledges by food companies and restaurants to reduce or eliminate meat that comes from animals treated with antibiotics, the purchase of antibiotics for use on farm animals has been increasing every year.

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States, the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to <a href="Antibiotic%20use%20in%20livestock">use of antibiotics in livestock</a> was raised by the US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1977. In March 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Defense%20Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock, which violated FDA regulations.

The term 'antibiosis', meaning "against life", was introduced by the French bacteriologist <a href="Jean%20Paul%20Vuillemin">Jean Paul Vuillemin</a> as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a> observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>". These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by <a href="Selman%20Waksman">Selman Waksman</a>, an American microbiologist, in 1942.

The term "antibiotic" was first used in 1942 by <a href="Selman%20Waksman">Selman Waksman</a> and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is <a href="wikt%3Aantagonism">antagonistic</a> to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution. This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as <a href="gastric%20juices">gastric juices</a> and <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>). It also excluded <a href="chemical%20synthesis">synthetic</a> antibacterial compounds such as the <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamides</a>. In current usage, the term "antibiotic" is applied to any medication that kills bacteria or inhibits their growth, regardless of whether that medication is produced by a microorganism or not.

The term "antibiotic" derives from "anti" + βιωτικός ("biōtikos"), "fit for life, lively", which comes from βίωσις ("biōsis"), "way of life", and that from βίος ("bios"), "life". The term "antibacterial" derives from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἀντί ("anti"), "against" + βακτήριον ("baktērion"), diminutive of βακτηρία ("baktēria"), "staff, cane", because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped.

The increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies together with decreasing number of new antibiotics currently being developed in the <a href="drug%20pipeline">drug pipeline</a> has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies that are alternatives to conventional antibacterials. Non-compound approaches (that is, products other than classical antibacterial agents) that target bacteria or approaches that target the host including <a href="phage%20therapy">phage therapy</a> and <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s are also being investigated to combat the problem.

One strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials. Resistance modifying agents are capable of partly or completely suppressing bacterial resistance mechanisms. For example, some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms, such as <a href="drug%20efflux">drug efflux</a> from the cell, thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial. Targets include:
Metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic-tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active.

<a href="Vaccine">Vaccine</a>s rely on <a href="immune">immune</a> modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a>, the production of <a href="antibody">antibodies</a>, <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases. Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.

<a href="Phage%20therapy">Phage therapy</a> is another method for treating antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Phage therapy infects pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a>s and their host ranges are extremely specific for certain bacteria, thus they do not disturb the host organism and intestinal microflora unlike antibiotics. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, infect and can kill bacteria and affect bacterial growth primarily during lytic cycles. Phages insert their DNA into the bacterium, where it is transcribed and used to make new phages, after which the cell will lyse, releasing new phage able to infect and destroy further bacteria of the same strain. The high specificity of phage protects "good" bacteria from destruction. However, some disadvantages to use of bacteriophages also exist. Bacteriophages may harbour virulence factors or toxic genes in their genomes and identification of genes with similarity to known virulence factors or toxins by genomic sequencing may be prudent prior to use. In addition, the oral and IV administration of phages for the eradication of bacterial infections poses a much higher safety risk than topical application, and there is the additional concern of uncertain immune responses to these large antigenic cocktails. There are considerable regulatory hurdles that must be cleared for such therapies. The use of bacteriophages as a replacement for antimicrobial agents against MDR pathogens no longer respond to conventional antibiotics remains an attractive option despite numerous challenges.

Plants are an important source of antimicrobial compounds and traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious diseases. There is a recent renewed interest into the use of natural products for the identification of new members of the 'antibiotic-ome' (defined as natural products with antibiotic activity), and their application in antibacterial drug discovery in <a href="Genomics">the genomics era</a>. Phytochemicals are the active biological component of plants and some phytochemicals including <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s, <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s, <a href="terpenoid">terpenoid</a>s and <a href="flavonoid">flavonoid</a>s possess antimicrobial activity. Some <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a>s also contain phytochemicals (<a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s), such as <a href="grape%20seed%20extract">grape seed extract</a>, and demonstrate "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" anti-bacterial properties. Phytochemicals are able to inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis, damage microbial membrane structures, modify bacterial membrane surface hydrophobicity and also modulate quorum-sensing. With increasing antibiotic resistance in recent years, the potential of new plant-derived antibiotics is under investigation.

In April 2013, the <a href="Infectious%20Disease%20Society%20of%20America">Infectious Disease Society of America</a> (IDSA) reported that the weak antibiotic pipeline does not match bacteria's increasing ability to develop resistance. Since 2009, only 2 new antibiotics were approved in the United States. The number of new antibiotics approved for marketing per year declines continuously. The report identified seven antibiotics against the <a href="Gram-negative%20bacilli">Gram-negative bacilli</a> (GNB) currently in <a href="Phases%20of%20clinical%20research%23Phase%20II">phase 2</a> or <a href="Phases%20of%20clinical%20research%23Phase%20III">phase 3</a> clinical trials. However, these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of resistance of GNB.
Some of these antibiotics are combination of existent treatments:
"Streptomyces" research is expected to provide new antibiotics, including treatment against <a href="MRSA">MRSA</a> and infections resistant to commonly used medication. Efforts of <a href="John%20Innes%20Centre">John Innes Centre</a> and universities in the UK, supported by BBSRC, resulted in the creation of spin-out companies, for example Novacta Biosystems, which has designed the type-b <a href="lantibiotic">lantibiotic</a>-based compound NVB302 (in phase 1) to treat "Clostridium difficile" infections.
Possible improvements include clarification of clinical trial regulations by FDA. Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the US, the <a href="Antibiotic%20Development%20to%20Advance%20Patient%20Treatment">Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment</a> (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat the growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">CDC</a> will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, "By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible."

Arnold Schwarzenegger

Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger (; ; born July 30, 1947) is an <a href="Austrian-American">Austrian-American</a> actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder who holds both Austrian and American citizenship. He served two terms as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20California">38th Governor of California</a> from 2003 to 2011.

Schwarzenegger began <a href="weight%20training">weight training</a> at the age of 15. He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a> contest seven times, remaining a prominent presence in bodybuilding and writing many books and articles on the sport. He is widely considered to be among the greatest bodybuilders of all time as well as bodybuilding's biggest icon. Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon. His breakthrough film was the <a href="sword-and-sorcery">sword-and-sorcery</a> epic "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>" in 1982, a box office hit that resulted in <a href="Conan%20the%20Destroyer">a sequel</a>.

In 1984, Schwarzenegger appeared in <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s science-fiction thriller film "<a href="The%20Terminator">The Terminator</a>", a critical and commercial success. Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the <a href="Terminator%20%28character%29">Terminator</a> character in <a href="Terminator%20%28franchise%29">the franchise</a>'s later installments: "" (1991), "" (2003), and "<a href="Terminator%20Genisys">Terminator Genisys</a>" (2015). He has appeared in a number of successful films, such as "<a href="Commando%20%281985%20film%29">Commando</a>" (1985), "<a href="The%20Running%20Man%20%281987%20film%29">The Running Man</a>" (1987), "<a href="Predator%20%28film%29">Predator</a>" (1987), "<a href="Twins%20%281988%20film%29">Twins</a>" (1988), "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%281990%20film%29">Total Recall</a>" (1990), "<a href="Kindergarten%20Cop">Kindergarten Cop</a>" (1990), and "<a href="True%20Lies">True Lies</a>" (1994). In 2015, it was announced that Schwarzenegger would replace <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> as the host of "<a href="The%20Celebrity%20Apprentice">The Celebrity Apprentice</a>", though he left after <a href="The%20New%20Celebrity%20Apprentice">one season</a> due to conflicts caused by Trump's remarks. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed "the Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" during his acting career, and "The Governator" (a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "Governor" and "The <a href="Terminator%20%28character%29">Terminator</a>") during his political career.

As a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in <a href="California%20gubernatorial%20recall%20election">a special recall election</a> to replace then-Governor <a href="Gray%20Davis">Gray Davis</a>. He was sworn in on November 17, to serve the remainder of Davis' term. He was then re-elected in the <a href="2006%20California%20gubernatorial%20election">2006 California gubernatorial election</a>, to serve a full term as governor. In 2011, he completed his second term as governor and returned to acting.

Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on July 30, 1947 in <a href="Thal%2C%20Styria">Thal, Styria</a>, the son of Aurelia ("née" Jadrny; July 29, 1922 – August 2, 1998) and <a href="Gustav%20Schwarzenegger">Gustav Schwarzenegger</a> (August 17, 1907 – December 13, 1972). Gustav was the local chief of police and had served in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as a "<a href="Hauptfeldwebel">Hauptfeldwebel</a>" after voluntarily joining the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in 1938, though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. He married Aurelia on October 20, 1945; he was 38 and she was 23. According to Schwarzenegger, both of his parents were very strict: "Back then in Austria it was a very different world ... if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents, <a href="wikt%3Aspare%20the%20rod%20and%20spoil%20the%20child">the rod was not spared</a>." Schwarzenegger grew up in a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> family who attended <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> every Sunday.

Gustav had a preference for his elder son, Meinhard (July 17, 1946 – May 20, 1971), over Arnold. His favoritism was "strong and blatant", which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child. Schwarzenegger has said his father had "no patience for listening or understanding your problems". He had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death. In later life, Schwarzenegger commissioned the <a href="Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> to research his father's wartime record, which came up with no evidence of Gustav being involved in atrocities, despite his membership in the Nazi Party and <a href="Sturmabteilung">SA</a>. Gustav's background received wide press attention during the 2003 <a href="California%20recall">California recall</a> campaign. At school, Schwarzenegger was reportedly academically average, but stood out for his "cheerful, good-humored, and exuberant" character. Money was a problem in their household; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator.

As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily influenced by his father. He picked up his first <a href="barbell">barbell</a> in 1960, when his <a href="association%20football">soccer</a> coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose <a href="bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a> over soccer as a career. He later said, "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start going to the gym and start Olympic lifting." However, his official website biography claims that "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career". During a speech in 2001, he said, "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was. My mother wanted me to go to trade school."

Schwarzenegger took to visiting a gym in <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, where he also frequented the local movie theaters to see bodybuilding idols such as <a href="Reg%20Park">Reg Park</a>, <a href="Steve%20Reeves">Steve Reeves</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a> on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look at myself in the mirror the next morning if I didn't do it." When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: "I was very young, but I remember my father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> movie."

Schwarzenegger's brother, Meinhard, died in a car crash on May 20, 1971. He was <a href="drunk%20driving">driving drunk</a> and died instantly. Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral. Meinhard was engaged to Erika Knapp, and they had a three-year-old son named <a href="Patrick%20M.%20Knapp%20Schwarzenegger">Patrick</a>. Schwarzenegger paid for Patrick's education and helped him to move to the U.S. Gustav died on December 13, 1972, from a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. In "<a href="Pumping%20Iron">Pumping Iron</a>", Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest. Later, he and the film's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder to show the extremes some would go to for their sport and to make Schwarzenegger's image colder to create controversy for the film. Barbara Baker, his first serious girlfriend, recalled that he informed her of his father's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother. Over time, he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father's funeral.

In an interview with "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" in 2004, Schwarzenegger told how he suffered what "would now be called child abuse" at the hands of his father: "My hair was pulled. I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel. Every time I got hit, and every time someone said, 'You can't do this,' I said, 'This is not going to be for much longer, because I'm going to move out of here. I want to be rich. I want to be somebody.'"

Schwarzenegger served in the <a href="Austrian%20Armed%20Forces">Austrian Army</a> in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males. During his army service, he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest. He went <a href="AWOL">AWOL</a> during basic training so he could take part in the competition and spent a week in military prison: "Participating in the competition meant so much to me that I didn't carefully think through the consequences." He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz, at Steirerhof Hotel (where he placed second). He was voted best built man of Europe, which made him famous. "The <a href="Universe%20Championships">Mr. Universe</a> title was my ticket to America—the land of opportunity, where I could become a star and get rich." Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966, attending the <a href="Universe_Championships%23History">NABBA Mr. Universe</a> competition in London. He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition, not having the muscle definition of American winner <a href="Chester%20Yorton">Chester Yorton</a>.

Charles "Wag" Bennett, one of the judges at the 1966 competition, was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him. As Schwarzenegger had little money, Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in <a href="Forest%20Gate">Forest Gate, London</a>. Yorton's leg definition had been judged superior, and Schwarzenegger, under a training program devised by Bennett, concentrated on improving the muscle definition and power in his legs. Staying in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language. Living with the Bennetts also changed him as a person: "Being with them made me so much more sophisticated. When you're the age I was then, you're always looking for approval, for love, for attention and also for guidance. At the time, I wasn't really aware of that. But now, looking back, I see that the Bennett family fulfilled all those needs. Especially my need to be the best in the world. To be recognized and to feel unique and special. They saw that I needed that care and attention and love.”

Also in 1966, while at the Bennett's home, Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol <a href="Reg%20Park">Reg Park</a>, who became his friend and mentor. The training paid off and, in 1967, Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time, becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20. He would go on to win the title a further three times. Schwarzenegger then flew back to <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, where he attended a business school and worked in a health club (Rolf Putziger's gym, where he worked and trained from 1966 to 1968), returning in 1968 to London to win his next Mr. Universe title. He frequently told <a href="Roger%20C.%20Field">Roger C. Field</a>, his English coach and friend in Munich at that time, "I'm going to become the greatest actor!"

Schwarzenegger, who dreamed of moving to the U.S. since the age of 10, and saw bodybuilding as the avenue through which to do so, realized his dream by moving to the United States in September 1968 at the age of 21, speaking little English. There he trained at <a href="Gold%27s%20Gym">Gold's Gym</a> in <a href="Venice%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Venice, Los Angeles</a>, California, under <a href="Joe%20Weider">Joe Weider</a>. From 1970 to 1974, one of Schwarzenegger's weight training partners was <a href="Ric%20Drasin">Ric Drasin</a>, a <a href="professional%20wrestler">professional wrestler</a> who designed the original Gold's Gym logo in 1973. Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler <a href="Superstar%20Billy%20Graham">Superstar Billy Graham</a>. In 1970, at age 23, he captured his first <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a> title in New York, and would go on to win the title a total of seven times.

The immigration law firm Siskind & Susser has stated that Schwarzenegger may have been an <a href="illegal%20immigrant">illegal immigrant</a> at some point in the late 1960s or early 1970s because of violations in the terms of his <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a>. "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" would later say in 2002 that Schwarzenegger is the most famous immigrant in America, who "overcame a thick Austrian accent and transcended the unlikely background of bodybuilding to become the biggest movie star in the world in the 1990s".

In 1977, Schwarzenegger's autobiography/weight-training guide "Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder" became a huge success. In 1977 he posed for the gay magazine "<a href="After%20Dark%20%28magazine%29">After Dark</a>". After taking English classes at <a href="Santa%20Monica%20College">Santa Monica College</a> in California, he earned a BA by correspondence from the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Superior">University of Wisconsin–Superior</a>, in international marketing of fitness and business administration in 1979. He got his American citizenship in 1983.

He tells that during this time he ran into a friend who told him that he was teaching <a href="Transcendental%20Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> (TM), which prompted Schwarzenegger to reveal he had been struggling with <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a> for the first time in his life: "Even today, I still benefit from [the year of TM] because I don't merge and bring things together and see everything as one big problem."

 
Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and his legacy is commemorated in the <a href="Arnold%20Classic">Arnold Classic</a> annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.

For many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines "<a href="Muscle%20%26amp%3B%20Fitness">Muscle & Fitness</a>" and "<a href="Flex%20%28magazine%29">Flex</a>". Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005. American Media Inc., which owns "Muscle & Fitness" and "Flex", announced in March 2013 that Schwarzenegger had accepted their renewed offer to be executive editor of the magazines.

One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965. He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19. He would go on to compete in, and win, many bodybuilding contests. His bodybuilding victories included five Mr. Universe (4 – <a href="National%20Amateur%20Body-Builders%27%20Association">NABBA</a> [England], 1 – <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20BodyBuilders">IFBB</a> [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until <a href="Lee%20Haney">Lee Haney</a> won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.

Schwarzenegger continues to work out even today. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 <a href="Arnold%20Classic">Arnold Classic</a> he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.

During Schwarzenegger's early years in bodybuilding, he also competed in several <a href="Olympic%20weightlifting">Olympic weightlifting</a> and <a href="powerlifting">powerlifting</a> contests. Schwarzenegger won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965, as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968.

In 1967, Schwarzenegger won the <a href="Munich">Munich</a> stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg/560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.

Schwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a>. His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion <a href="Sergio%20Oliva">Sergio Oliva</a>. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he still holds to this day.

He continued his winning streak in the 1971–74 competitions. In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time, beating <a href="Franco%20Columbu">Franco Columbu</a>. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.

Months before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called "<a href="Pumping%20Iron">Pumping Iron</a>." Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film "<a href="Stay%20Hungry%20%28film%29">Stay Hungry</a>" with <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>. <a href="Lou%20Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.

Schwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia. Schwarzenegger was training for his role in "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan</a>", and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide <a href="color%20commentary">color commentary</a> for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: "Why not compete?" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition.

Schwarzenegger has admitted to using performance-enhancing <a href="anabolic%20steroid">anabolic steroid</a>s while they were legal, writing in 1977 that "steroids were helpful to me in maintaining muscle size while on a strict diet in preparation for a contest. I did not use them for muscle growth, but rather for muscle maintenance when <a href="Weight%20cutting">cutting up</a>." He has called the drugs "tissue building".

In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German doctor who publicly predicted his early death on the basis of a link between his steroid use and his <a href="%23Accidents%20and%20injuries">later heart problems</a>. As the doctor had never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with the "<a href="Globe%20%28tabloid%29">Globe</a>", a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.

Schwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding into acting, finally achieving it when he was chosen to play the role of Hercules in 1970's "<a href="Hercules%20in%20New%20York">Hercules in New York</a>". Credited under the <a href="stage%20name">stage name</a> "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were <a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a> after production. His second film appearance was as a <a href="deaf-mute">deaf-mute</a> mob hitman in "<a href="The%20Long%20Goodbye%20%28film%29">The Long Goodbye</a>" (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film "<a href="Stay%20Hungry%20%28film%29">Stay Hungry</a>" (1976), for which he was awarded a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20New%20Star%20of%20the%20Year%20%E2%80%93%20Actor">Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year</a>. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: "It was very difficult for me in the beginning – I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance."

Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the <a href="bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a> film "<a href="Pumping%20Iron">Pumping Iron</a>" (1977), elements of which were dramatized; in 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography. In 1977, he made guest appearances in single episodes of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="The%20San%20Pedro%20Beach%20Bums">The San Pedro Beach Bums</a>" and the ABC <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> "<a href="The%20Streets%20of%20San%20Francisco">The Streets of San Francisco</a>". Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">The Incredible Hulk</a>", but did not win the role because of his height. Later, <a href="Lou%20Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> got the part of Dr. David Banner's alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a> and <a href="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</a> in the 1979 comedy "<a href="The%20Villain%20%281979%20film%29">The Villain</a>". In 1980, he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress <a href="Jayne%20Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a> as Mansfield's husband, <a href="Mickey%20Hargitay">Mickey Hargitay</a>.

Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the <a href="sword-and-sorcery">sword-and-sorcery</a> epic "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>" in 1982, which was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, "<a href="Conan%20the%20Destroyer">Conan the Destroyer</a>", in 1984, although it was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video, "<a href="Rio%20Carnival">Carnival</a> in Rio". In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character, and what some would say was his acting career's signature role, in <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a>'s science fiction <a href="thriller%20film">thriller film</a> "<a href="The%20Terminator">The Terminator</a>". Following this, Schwarzenegger made "<a href="Red%20Sonja%20%28film%29">Red Sonja</a>" in 1985.

During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> becoming international stars. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He made a number of successful action films in the '80s, such as "<a href="Commando%20%281985%20film%29">Commando</a>" (1985), "<a href="Raw%20Deal%20%281986%20film%29">Raw Deal</a>" (1986), "<a href="The%20Running%20Man%20%281987%20film%29">The Running Man</a>" (1987), "<a href="Predator%20%28film%29">Predator</a>" (1987), and "<a href="Red%20Heat">Red Heat</a>" (1988).
"<a href="Twins%20%281988%20film%29">Twins</a>" (1988), a comedy with <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>, also proved successful. "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%281990%20film%29">Total Recall</a>" (1990) netted Schwarzenegger $10 million and 15% of the film's gross. A science fiction script, the film was based on the <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> short story "<a href="We%20Can%20Remember%20It%20for%20You%20Wholesale">We Can Remember It for You Wholesale</a>". "<a href="Kindergarten%20Cop">Kindergarten Cop</a>" (1990) reunited him with director <a href="Ivan%20Reitman">Ivan Reitman</a>, who directed him in "Twins". Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing, first with a 1990 episode of the TV series "<a href="Tales%20from%20the%20Crypt%20%28TV%20series%29">Tales from the Crypt</a>", entitled "<a href="List%20of%20Tales%20from%20the%20Crypt%20episodes%23Season%202%20%281990%29">The Switch</a>", and then with the 1992 <a href="telemovie">telemovie</a> "<a href="Christmas%20in%20Connecticut">Christmas in Connecticut</a>". He has not directed since.

Schwarzenegger's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991's "Terminator 2: Judgment Day", which was the highest-grossing film of 1991. In 1993, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Theatre%20Owners">National Association of Theatre Owners</a> named him the "International Star of the Decade". His next film project, the 1993 self-aware <a href="action%20comedy">action comedy</a> <a href="parody">spoof</a> "Last Action Hero", was released opposite "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>", and did not do well at the box office. His next film, the comedy drama "<a href="True%20Lies">True Lies</a>" (1994), was a popular spy film, and saw Schwarzenegger reunited with James Cameron.

That same year, the comedy "<a href="Junior%20%281994%20film%29">Junior</a>" was released, the last of Schwarzenegger's three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co-starring Danny DeVito. This film brought him his second Golden Globe nomination, this time for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Best Actor – Musical or Comedy</a>. It was followed by the action thriller "<a href="Eraser%20%28film%29">Eraser</a>" (1996), the Christmas comedy "<a href="Jingle%20All%20The%20Way">Jingle All The Way</a>" (1996), and the comic book-based "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>" (1997), in which he played the villain <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>. This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury. Following the critical failure of "Batman & Robin", his film career and box office prominence went into decline. He returned with the supernatural thriller "<a href="End%20of%20Days%20%28film%29">End of Days</a>" (1999), later followed by the action films "<a href="The%206th%20Day">The 6th Day</a>" (2000) and "<a href="Collateral%20Damage%20%28film%29">Collateral Damage</a>" (2002), both of which failed to do well at the box office. In 2003, he made his third appearance as the title character in "", which went on to earn over $150 million domestically.

In tribute to Schwarzenegger in 2002, Forum Stadtpark, a local cultural association, proposed plans to build a 25-meter (82 ft) tall "Terminator" statue in a park in central <a href="Graz">Graz</a>. Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered, but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>.

His film appearances after becoming Governor of California included a three-second cameo appearance in "<a href="The%20Rundown">The Rundown</a>", and the 2004 remake of "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%2080%20Days%20%282004%20film%29">Around the World in 80 Days</a>". In 2005, he appeared as himself in the film "<a href="The%20Kid%20%26amp%3B%20I">The Kid & I</a>". He voiced <a href="Baron%20von%20Steuben">Baron von Steuben</a> in the "<a href="Liberty%27s%20Kids">Liberty's Kids</a>" episode "<a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>". He had been rumored to be appearing in "<a href="Terminator%20Salvation">Terminator Salvation</a>" as the original T-800; he denied his involvement, but he ultimately did appear briefly via his image being inserted into the movie from stock footage of the first "Terminator" movie. Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone's "<a href="The%20Expendables%20%282010%20film%29">The Expendables</a>", where he made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>.

In January 2011, just weeks after leaving office in California, Schwarzenegger announced that he was reading several new scripts for future films, one of them being the World War II action drama "With Wings as Eagles", written by <a href="Randall%20Wallace">Randall Wallace</a>, based on a true story. On March 6, 2011, at the Arnold Seminar of the <a href="Arnold%20Classic">Arnold Classic</a>, Schwarzenegger revealed that he was being considered for several films, including sequels to "<a href="The%20Terminator">The Terminator</a>" and remakes of "<a href="Predator%20%28film%29">Predator</a>" and "<a href="The%20Running%20Man%20%281987%20film%29">The Running Man</a>", and that he was "packaging" a comic book character. The character was later revealed to be <a href="the%20Governator">the Governator</a>, star of the comic book and animated series of the same name. Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a>, who would have produced the series. Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator.

On May 20, 2011, Schwarzenegger's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted: "Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines". On July 11, 2011, it was announced that Schwarzenegger was considering a comeback film despite his legal problems. He appeared in "<a href="The%20Expendables%202">The Expendables 2</a>" (2012), and starred in "<a href="The%20Last%20Stand%20%282013%20film%29">The Last Stand</a>" (2013), his first leading role in 10 years, and "<a href="Escape%20Plan%20%28film%29">Escape Plan</a>" (2013), his first co-starring role alongside Sylvester Stallone. He starred in "<a href="Sabotage%20%282014%20film%29">Sabotage</a>", released in March 2014, and appeared in "<a href="The%20Expendables%203%20%282014%20film%29">The Expendables 3</a>", released in August 2014. He starred in the fifth Terminator movie "<a href="Terminator%20Genisys">Terminator Genisys</a>" in 2015 and will reprise his role as <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a> in "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29%23Sequels">The Legend of Conan</a>", later renamed "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29%23Sequels">Conan the Conqueror</a>".

In August 2016, his filming of action-comedy "<a href="Why%20We%27re%20Killing%20Gunther">Why We're Killing Gunther</a>" was temporarily interrupted by bank robbers near filming location in <a href="Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia">Surrey, British Columbia</a>. He was announced to star and produce in a film about the ruins of <a href="Sanxingdui">Sanxingdui</a> called "The Guest of Sanxingdui", as an ambassador.

In September 2015, it was announced Schwarzenegger would replace <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> as host of "<a href="The%20New%20Celebrity%20Apprentice">The New Celebrity Apprentice</a>". This show, the 15th season of "The Apprentice", aired during the 2016–2017 TV season. In the show, he used the phrases "you're terminated" and "get to the choppa", which are quotes from some of his famous roles, when firing the contestants. 

In March 2017, following repeated criticisms from <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, Schwarzenegger announced that he would not return for another season on the show. Schwarzenegger reacted to Trump’s latest remarks on January 2017: “Hey, Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs?” he asked in an Instagram clip. “You take over TV because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.”

Selected notable roles:

Schwarzenegger has been a registered <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> for many years. As an actor, his political views were always well known as they contrasted with those of many other prominent Hollywood stars, who are generally considered to be a <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a> and <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a>-leaning community. At the <a href="2004%20Republican%20National%20Convention">2004 Republican National Convention</a>, Schwarzenegger gave a speech and explained he was a Republican because the Democrats of the 1960s sounded too much like Austrian socialists.

In 1985, Schwarzenegger appeared in "<a href="Stop%20the%20Madness">Stop the Madness</a>", an anti-drug music video sponsored by the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan administration</a>. He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201988">1988 presidential election</a>, accompanying then-Vice President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> at a campaign rally.

Schwarzenegger's first political appointment was as chairman of the <a href="President%27s%20Council%20on%20Physical%20Fitness%20and%20Sports">President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports</a>, on which he served from 1990 to 1993. He was nominated by <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, who dubbed him "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan</a> the Republican". He later served as chairman for the California Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor <a href="Pete%20Wilson">Pete Wilson</a>.

Between 1993 and 1994, Schwarzenegger was a <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> ambassador (a ceremonial role fulfilled by celebrities), recording several television/radio <a href="public%20service%20announcement">public service announcement</a>s to donate blood.

In an interview with "<a href="Talk%20%28magazine%29">Talk</a>" magazine in late 1999, Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office. He replied, "I think about it many times. The possibility is there, because I feel it inside." "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for <a href="governor%20of%20California">governor of California</a>. Following his initial comments, Schwarzenegger said, "I'm in show business – I am in the middle of my career. Why would I go away from that and jump into something else?"

Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the <a href="California%20recall%20election%2C%202003">2003 California recall election</a> for Governor of California on August 6, 2003, episode of "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>". Schwarzenegger had the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to "The Terminator" movies, see above) and "<a href="The%20Running%20Man%20%281987%20film%29">The Running Man</a>" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the recall election "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%281990%20film%29">Total Recall</a>" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one debate on September 24, 2003.
On October 7, 2003, the recall election resulted in Governor <a href="Gray%20Davis">Gray Davis</a> being removed from office with 55.4% of the "Yes" vote in favor of a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat <a href="Cruz%20Bustamante">Cruz Bustamante</a>, fellow Republican <a href="Tom%20McClintock">Tom McClintock</a>, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes. Under the regulations of the <a href="California%20Constitution">California Constitution</a>, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor <a href="John%20G.%20Downey">John G. Downey</a> in 1862.

Schwarzenegger was entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up <a href="gridlock">gridlock</a>. Building on a catchphrase from the sketch "<a href="Hans%20and%20Franz">Hans and Franz</a>" from "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" (which partly parodied his bodybuilding career), Schwarzenegger called the Democratic State politicians "<a href="girlie%20men">girlie men</a>".

Schwarzenegger's early victories included repealing an unpopular increase in the vehicle registration fee as well as preventing driver's licenses being given out to illegal immigrants, but later he began to feel the backlash when powerful state unions began to oppose his various initiatives. Key among his reckoning with political realities was a <a href="California%20special%20election%2C%202005">special election</a> he called in November 2005, in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated. Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California. He would later comment that "no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you". The U.S. Supreme Court later found the public employee unions' use of compulsory fundraising during the campaign had been illegal in "<a href="Knox%20v.%20Service%20Employees%20International%20Union%2C%20Local%201000">Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000</a>".

Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat, Susan Kennedy, as his Chief of Staff. Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position, determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election.

Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat <a href="Phil%20Angelides">Phil Angelides</a>, the <a href="California%20State%20Treasurer">California State Treasurer</a>, in the <a href="California%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202006">2006 elections</a>, held on November 7, 2006. Despite a poor year nationally for the Republican party, Schwarzenegger won re-election with 56.0% of the vote compared with 38.9% for Angelides, a margin of well over one million votes. In recent years, many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum. After hearing a speech by Schwarzenegger at the 2006 <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> breakfast, San Francisco mayor <a href="Gavin%20Newsom">Gavin Newsom</a> said that, "[H]e's becoming a Democrat [… H]e's running back, not even to the center. I would say center-left".

It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in 2010, as his governorship would be term-limited by that time. This turned out to be false.
Wendy Leigh, who wrote an unofficial biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise from an early age using the movie business and <a href="bodybuilding">bodybuilding</a> as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, "I wanted to be part of the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential – I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, "I married into a political family. You get together with them and you hear about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and <a href="Sargent%20Shriver">Sargent Shriver</a> became my heroes." Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.

Schwarzenegger cannot run for president as he is not a <a href="natural%20born%20citizen%20of%20the%20United%20States">natural born citizen of the United States</a>. Schwarzenegger is a dual Austrian/United States citizen. He has held <a href="Austrian%20nationality%20law">Austrian citizenship</a> since birth and <a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law">U.S. citizenship</a> since becoming naturalized in 1983. Being Austrian and thus European, he was able to win the 2007 <a href="European%20Voice">European Voice</a> campaigner of the year award for taking action against climate change with the California <a href="Global%20Warming%20Solutions%20Act%20of%202006">Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a> and plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme with other US states and possibly with the EU.
Because of his personal wealth from his acting career, Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor's salary of $175,000 per year.

Schwarzenegger's endorsement in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">Republican primary</a> of the <a href="2008%20U.S.%20presidential%20election">2008 U.S. presidential election</a> was highly sought; despite being good friends with candidates <a href="Rudy%20Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> and Senator <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, Schwarzenegger remained neutral throughout 2007 and early 2008. Giuliani dropped out of the presidential race on January 30, 2008, largely because of a poor showing in Florida, and endorsed McCain. Later that night, Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Presidential%20Library">Ronald Reagan Presidential Library</a> in California. The following day, he endorsed McCain, joking, "It's Rudy's fault!" (in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind). Schwarzenegger's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain's campaign; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy.

In its April 2010 report, <a href="Progressivism">Progressive</a> ethics watchdog group <a href="Citizens%20for%20Responsibility%20and%20Ethics%20in%20Washington">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> named Schwarzenegger one of 11 "worst governors" in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Schwarzenegger's term as governor.

Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing <a href="California%20Proposition%2066%20%282004%29">Proposition 66</a>, a proposed amendment of the Californian <a href="Three%20Strikes%20Law">Three Strikes Law</a>, in November 2004. This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence. In the last week before the ballot, Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign against Proposition 66. He stated that "it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists".

Although he began his tenure as governor with record high approval ratings (as high as 89% in December 2003), he left office with a record low 23%, only one percent higher than that of Gray Davis, when he was recalled in October 2003.

In May 2010, Esteban Núñez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the <a href="death%20of%20Louis%20Santos">death of Louis Santos</a>. Núñez is the son of <a href="Fabian%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez">Fabian Núñez</a>, then <a href="California%20Assembly">California Assembly</a> Speaker of the House and a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Schwarzenegger.

As a personal favor to "a friend", just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger <a href="Commutation%20of%20sentence">commuted</a> Núñez's sentence by more than half, to seven years. Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos' family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter.

The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated <a href="Marsy%27s%20Law">Marsy's Law</a>. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, "Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state." However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. Subsequently, as a direct result of the way the commutation was handled, Governor <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a> signed a bipartisan bill that allows offender's victims and their families to be notified at least 10 days notice for any commutations. Núñez was released from prison after serving less than six years.

During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger, dubbed "Gropegate". Within the last five days before the election, news reports appeared in the "Los Angeles Times" recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women, six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories.

Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts, a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock. A fifth woman claimed Schwarzenegger tried to take off her bathing suit in a hotel elevator, and the last said he pulled her onto his lap and asked her about a sex act.

Schwarzenegger admitted that he has "behaved badly sometimes" and apologized, but also stated that "a lot of [what] you see in the stories is not true". This came after an interview in adult magazine "<a href="Oui%20%28magazine%29">Oui</a>" from 1977 surfaced, in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a>. Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film "<a href="Pumping%20Iron">Pumping Iron</a>." In an interview with "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" magazine in October 2007, Schwarzenegger said, "[Marijuana] is not a drug. It's a leaf. My drug was pumping iron, trust me." His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke.

British television personality <a href="Anna%20Richardson">Anna Richardson</a> settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger, his top aide, Sean Walsh, and his publicist, Sheryl Main. A joint statement read: "The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled." Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for "<a href="The%206th%20Day">The 6th Day</a>" in London. She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a "Los Angeles Times" article when they contended she encouraged his behavior.

Schwarzenegger became a <a href="naturalized%20U.S.%20citizen">naturalized U.S. citizen</a> on September 17, 1983. Shortly before he gained his citizenship, he asked the Austrian authorities for the right to keep his <a href="Austrian%20citizenship">Austrian citizenship</a>, as Austria does not usually allow <a href="dual%20citizenship">dual citizenship</a>. His request was granted, and he retained his Austrian citizenship. In 2005, <a href="Peter%20Pilz">Peter Pilz</a>, a member of the <a href="Austrian%20Parliament">Austrian Parliament</a> from the <a href="Austrian%20Green%20Party">Austrian Green Party</a>, unsuccessfully advocated for Parliament to revoke Schwarzenegger's Austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of <a href="Donald%20Beardslee">Donald Beardslee</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Williams">Stanley Williams</a>. Pilz argued that Schwarzenegger caused damage to Austria's reputation in the international community, because Austria abolished the death penalty in 1968. Pilz based his argument on Article 33 of the Austrian Citizenship Act, which states: "A citizen, who is in the public service of a foreign country, shall be deprived of his citizenship, if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the Austrian Republic." Pilz claimed that Schwarzenegger's actions in support of the death penalty (prohibited in Austria under Protocol 13 of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>) had damaged Austria's reputation. Schwarzenegger explained his actions by pointing out that his only duty as Governor of California with respect to the death penalty was to correct an error by the justice system by pardon or clemency, if such an error had occurred.

On September 27, 2006, Schwarzenegger signed the <a href="Global%20Warming%20Solutions%20Act%20of%202006">Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a>, creating the nation's first cap on <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere. Schwarzenegger also signed a second global warming bill that prohibits large utilities and corporations in California from making long-term contracts with suppliers who do not meet the state's greenhouse gas emission standards. The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020. In 2005, Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.

Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17, 2006, allowing California to work with the Northeast's <a href="Regional%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Initiative">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>. They plan to reduce <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states. Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference. The plan took effect in 2009. In addition to using his political power to fight global warming, the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint. Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his <a href="Hummer%20H1">Hummers</a> to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels. He has also installed solar panels to heat his home.

In respect of his contribution to the direction of the US motor industry, Schwarzenegger was invited to open the 2009 <a href="Society%20of%20Automotive%20Engineers">SAE</a> World Congress in Detroit, on April 20, 2009.

In 2011, Schwarzenegger founded the <a href="R20%20Regions%20of%20Climate%20Action">R20 Regions of Climate Action</a> to develop a sustainable, low carbon economy.

The <a href="Equal%20Opportunity%20to%20Govern%20Amendment">Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment</a> in 2003 was widely accredited as the "Amend for Arnold" bill, which would have removed language from the U.S. Constitution prohibiting his run, having been born in Austria. In 2004, the "Amend for Arnold" campaign was launched, featuring a website and TV advertising promotion.

In June 2007, Schwarzenegger was featured on the cover of TIME magazine with Michael Bloomberg, and subsequently the two joked about a Presidential ticket together.

In October 2013, the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" reported that Schwarzenegger was exploring a future run for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">president</a>. The former California governor would face a <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">constitutional</a> hurdle; <a href="Natural-born-citizen%20clause">Article II, Section I, Clause V</a> nominally prevents individuals who are not natural-born citizens of the United States from assuming the office. He has reportedly been lobbying legislators about a possible <a href="Article%20Five%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">constitutional change</a>, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> law professor <a href="Michael%20C.%20Dorf">Michael Dorf</a> observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, "The law is very clear, but it's not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process."

Schwarzenegger has had a highly successful business career. Following his move to the United States, Schwarzenegger became a "prolific goal setter" and would write his objectives at the start of the year on index cards, like starting a mail order business or buying a new car – and succeed in doing so. By the age of 30, Schwarzenegger was a millionaire, well before his career in Hollywood. His financial independence came from his success as a budding entrepreneur with a series of successful business ventures and investments.

In 1968, Schwarzenegger and fellow bodybuilder <a href="Franco%20Columbu">Franco Columbu</a> started a bricklaying business. The business flourished thanks to the pair's marketing savvy and an increased demand following the <a href="1971%20San%20Fernando%20earthquake">1971 San Fernando earthquake</a>. Schwarzenegger and Columbu used profits from their bricklaying venture to start a mail order business, selling bodybuilding and fitness-related equipment and instructional tapes.

Schwarzenegger rolled profits from the mail order business and his bodybuilding competition winnings into his first real estate investment venture: an apartment building he purchased for $10,000. He would later go on to invest in a number of real estate holding companies.

Schwarzenegger was a founding celebrity investor in the <a href="Planet%20Hollywood">Planet Hollywood</a> chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a>) along with <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> and <a href="Demi%20Moore">Demi Moore</a>. Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in early 2000. Schwarzenegger said the company had not had the success he had hoped for, claiming he wanted to focus his attention on "new US global business ventures" and his movie career.

He also invested in a shopping mall in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>. He has talked about some of those who have helped him over the years in business: "I couldn't have learned about business without a parade of teachers guiding me... from <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> to <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>... and now, <a href="Les%20Wexner">Les Wexner</a> and <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>. I even learned a thing or two from Planet Hollywood, such as when to get out! And I did!" He has significant ownership in <a href="Dimensional%20Fund%20Advisors">Dimensional Fund Advisors</a>, an investment firm. Schwarzenegger is also the owner of Arnold's Sports Festival, which he started in 1989 and is held annually in Columbus, Ohio. It is a festival that hosts thousands of international health and fitness professionals which has also expanded into a three-day expo. He also owns a movie production company called Oak Productions, Inc. and Fitness Publications, a joint publishing venture with <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>.

In 1992, Schwarzenegger and his wife opened a restaurant in <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a> called "Schatzi On Main". "Schatzi" literally means "little treasure," colloquial for "honey" or "darling" in German. In 1998, he sold his restaurant.

Schwarzenegger's net worth had been conservatively estimated at $100–$200 million. After separating from his wife, <a href="Maria%20Shriver">Maria Shriver</a>, in 2011, it has been estimated that his net worth has been approximately $400 million, and even as high as $800 million, based on tax returns he filed in 2006.

Over the years as an investor, he invested his bodybuilding and movie earnings in an array of stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to <a href="2007%20financial%20crisis">economic recessions</a> in the U.S. and <a href="Eurozone%20crisis">Europe</a> since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38 million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet. Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, "Money doesn't make you happy. I now have $50 million, but I was just as happy when I had $48 million."

He appears in a series of commercials for the <a href="Machine%20Zone">Machine Zone</a> game "Mobile Strike" as a military commander and spokesman.

In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher he lived with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his <a href="memoir">memoir</a> in 1977: "Basically it came down to this: she was a well-balanced woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." Baker has described Schwarzenegger as "[a] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" but claims towards the end of the relationship he became "insufferable – classically conceited – the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled "Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak". Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the <a href="Apollo%2011">first Apollo Moon landing</a> on television. They shared an <a href="apartment">apartment</a> in <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a> for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had "little understanding of polite society" and she found him a turn-off, she says, "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me."

Schwarzenegger met his next paramour, Sue Moray, a <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a> hairdresser's assistant, on <a href="Venice%20Beach">Venice Beach</a> in July 1977. According to Moray, the couple led an open relationship: "We were faithful when we were both in LA … but when he was out of town, we were free to do whatever we wanted." Schwarzenegger met <a href="Maria%20Shriver">Maria Shriver</a> at the Robert F. Kennedy Tennis Tournament in August 1977, and went on to have a relationship with both women until August 1978, when Moray (who knew of his relationship with Shriver) issued an ultimatum.

On April 26, 1986, Schwarzenegger married television journalist <a href="Maria%20Shriver">Maria Shriver</a>, niece of President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, in <a href="Hyannis%2C%20Massachusetts">Hyannis, Massachusetts</a>. The Rev. John Baptist Riordan performed the ceremony at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. They have four children: <a href="Katherine%20Schwarzenegger">Katherine Eunice Schwarzenegger</a> (born December 13, 1989); Christina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger (born July 23, 1991); <a href="Patrick%20Schwarzenegger">Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger</a> (born September 18, 1993); and Christopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger (born September 27, 1997); all born in Los Angeles. The family lived in a home in <a href="Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Brentwood</a>, with vacation homes in <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley, Idaho</a>, and <a href="Hyannis%20Port%2C%20Massachusetts">Hyannis Port, Massachusetts</a>. They attended <a href="St.%20Monica%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Santa%20Monica%2C%20California%29">St. Monica's Catholic Church</a>.

On May 9, 2011, Shriver and Schwarzenegger ended their relationship after 25 years of marriage, with Shriver moving out of the couple's Brentwood mansion. On May 16, 2011, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" revealed that Schwarzenegger had fathered a son more than fourteen years earlier with an employee in their household, Mildred Patricia 'Patty' Baena. "After leaving the governor's office I told my wife about this event, which occurred over a decade ago," Schwarzenegger said in a statement issued to "The Times". In the statement, Schwarzenegger did not mention that he had confessed to his wife only after Shriver had confronted him with the information, which she had done after confirming with the housekeeper what she had suspected about the child.

Baena is of <a href="Guatemalan%20people">Guatemalan</a> origin, she was employed by the family for 20 years and retired in January 2011. The pregnant Baena was working in the home while Shriver was pregnant with the youngest of the couple's four children. Baena's son with Schwarzenegger, Joseph, was born on October 2, 1997; Shriver gave birth to Christopher on September 27, 1997. Schwarzenegger says it took seven or eight years before he found out that he had fathered a child with his housekeeper. It was not until the boy "started looking like me, that's when I kind of got it. I put things together," the action star and former California governor, told "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>". Schwarzenegger has taken financial responsibility for the child "from the start and continued to provide support." <a href="KNX%20%28AM%29">KNX 1070</a> radio reported that in 2010 he bought a new four-bedroom house, with a pool, for Baena and their son in <a href="Bakersfield%2C%20California">Bakersfield</a>, about north of Los Angeles. Baena separated from her husband, Rogelio, in 1997, a few months after Joseph's birth, and filed for divorce in 2008. Baena's ex-husband says that the child's birth certificate was falsified and that he plans to sue Schwarzenegger for engaging in conspiracy to falsify a public document, a serious crime in California.

Schwarzenegger has consulted an attorney, Bob Kaufman. Kaufman has earlier handled divorce cases for celebrities such as <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href="Reese%20Witherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a>. Schwarzenegger will keep the Brentwood home as part of their divorce settlement and Shriver has purchased a new home nearby so that the children may travel easily between their parents' homes. They will share custody of the two minor children. Schwarzenegger came under fire after the initial petition did not include spousal support and a reimbursement of attorney's fees. However, he claims this was not intentional and that he signed the initial documents without having properly read them. Schwarzenegger has filed amended divorce papers remedying this.

After the scandal, actress <a href="Brigitte%20Nielsen">Brigitte Nielsen</a> came forward and stated that she too had an affair with Schwarzenegger while he was in a relationship with Shriver, saying, "Maybe I wouldn't have got into it if he said 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is dead serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on." When asked in 2014 "Of all the things you are famous for … which are you least proud of?", Schwarzenegger replied "I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up".

As of July 2015, Schwarzenegger was dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior.

Schwarzenegger was born with a <a href="bicuspid%20aortic%20valve">bicuspid aortic valve</a>, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart valve replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available at the time of his surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.

On December 9, 2001, he broke six ribs and was hospitalized for four days after a motorcycle crash in Los Angeles.

Schwarzenegger saved a drowning man's life in 2004 while on vacation in Hawaii by swimming out and bringing him back to shore.

On January 8, 2006, while Schwarzenegger was riding his <a href="Harley%20Davidson">Harley Davidson</a> motorcycle in Los Angeles, with his son Patrick in the sidecar, another driver backed into the street he was riding on, causing him and his son to collide with the car at a low speed. While his son and the other driver were unharmed, Schwarzenegger sustained a minor injury to his lip, requiring 15 stitches. "No citations were issued", said Officer Jason Lee, a <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> spokesman. Schwarzenegger did not obtain his motorcycle license until July 3, 2006.

Schwarzenegger tripped over his ski pole and broke his right <a href="femur">femur</a> while skiing in <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley, Idaho</a>, with his family on December 23, 2006. On December 26, 2006, he underwent a 90-minute operation in which cables and screws were used to wire the broken bone back together. He was released from the <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Health%20Center">St. John's Health Center</a> on December 30, 2006.

Schwarzenegger's private jet made an emergency landing at <a href="Van%20Nuys%20Airport">Van Nuys Airport</a> on June 19, 2009, after the pilot reported smoke coming from the cockpit, according to a statement released by the governor's press secretary. No one was harmed in the incident.

Schwarzenegger's official height of 6'2" (1.88 m) has been brought into question by several articles. In his bodybuilding days in the late 1960s, he was measured to be 6'1.5" (1.87 m), a height confirmed by his fellow bodybuilders. However, in 1988 both the "Daily Mail" and "Time Out" magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter. Prior to running for governor, Schwarzenegger's height was once again questioned in an article by the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>". As governor, Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman <a href="Herb%20Wesson">Herb Wesson</a> over their heights. At one point, Wesson made an unsuccessful attempt to, in his own words, "settle this once and for all and find out how tall he is" by using a tailor's tape measure on the Governor. Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words "Need a lift?" on the five-foot-five inch (165 cm) Wesson's chair before a negotiating session in his office. <a href="Bob%20Mulholland">Bob Mulholland</a> also claimed Schwarzenegger was 5'10" (1.78 m) and that he wore risers in his boots. In 1999, "<a href="Men%27s%20Health%20%28magazine%29">Men's Health</a>" magazine stated his height was 5'10".

Schwarzenegger's autobiography, "Total Recall", was released in October 2012. He devotes one chapter called "The Secret" to his extramarital affair. The majority of his book is about his successes in the three major chapters in his life: bodybuilder, actor, and Governor of California.

Schwarzenegger was the first civilian to purchase a <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a>. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, <a href="AM%20General">AM General</a>, to produce a <a href="street-legal%20vehicle">street-legal</a>, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two <a href="Hummer%20H1">Hummer H1</a>s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, one for <a href="vegetable%20oil">vegetable oil</a>, and one for <a href="biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare <a href="Bugatti%20Veyron">Bugatti Veyron</a> Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminium forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark brown leather. In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20G-Class">Mercedes G-Class</a> modified for <a href="battery%20electric%20vehicle">all-electric</a> drive.

The Hummers that Schwarzenegger bought in 1992 are so large – each weighs and is wide – that they are classified as large trucks, and U.S. fuel economy regulations do not apply to them. During the gubernatorial recall campaign he announced that he would convert one of his Hummers to burn hydrogen. The conversion was reported to have cost about US$21,000. After the election, he signed an executive order to jump-start the building of hydrogen refueling plants called the <a href="California%20Hydrogen%20Highway">California Hydrogen Highway</a> Network, and gained a <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a> grant to help pay for its projected US$91,000,000 cost. California took delivery of the first H2H (Hydrogen Hummer) in October 2004.

Schwarzenegger has been involved with the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a> for many years after they were founded by his ex-mother-in-law, Eunice Kennedy Shriver. In 2007, Schwarzenegger was the official spokesperson for the Special Olympics which were held in Shanghai, China. Schwarzenegger believes that quality school opportunities should be made available to children who might not normally be able to access them. In 1995, he founded the Inner City Games Foundation (ICG) which provides cultural, educational and community enrichment programming to youth. ICG is active in 15 cities around the country and serves over 250,000 children in over 400 schools countrywide. He has also been involved with After-School All-Stars, and founded the Los Angeles branch in 2002. ASAS is an after school program provider, educating youth about health, fitness and nutrition.

On February 12, 2010, Schwarzenegger took part in the Vancouver Olympic Torch relay. He handed off the flame to the next runner, <a href="Sebastian%20Coe">Sebastian Coe</a>.

Schwarzenegger had a collection of Marxist busts, which he requested from Russian friends at the end of the Soviet Union as they were being destroyed. In 2011, he revealed that his wife had requested they be removed, but he kept the one of <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> present, since "he was the first". In 2015, he said he kept the Lenin bust to "show losers".

Schwarzenegger is a lifelong supporter and "friend of Israel", and has participated in L.A.'s Pro-Israel rally among other similar events.
In 2012, Schwarzenegger helped to found the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, which is a part of the <a href="USC%20Sol%20Price%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy">USC Sol Price School of Public Policy</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. The Institute's mission is to "[advance] post-partisanship, where leaders put people over political parties and work together to find the best ideas and solutions to benefit the people they serve" and to "seek to influence public policy and public debate in finding solutions to the serious challenges we face". Schwarzenegger serves as chairman of the Institute.

At a 2015 security conference, Arnold Schwarzenegger called <a href="global%20warming">climate change</a> the issue of our time.

For the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202016">2016 Republican Party presidential primaries</a>, Schwarzenegger endorsed fellow Republican <a href="John%20Kasich%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">John Kasich</a>. However, he announced in October that he would not vote for the Republican presidential candidate <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">that year's United States presidential election</a>, with this being the first time he did not vote for the Republican candidate since becoming a citizen in 1983.

Actium

Actium (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: Ἄκτιον) was the name of an ancient town on a <a href="promontory">promontory</a> of western Greece in northwestern <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>, at the mouth of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Arta">Ambracian Gulf</a>). Actium is chiefly famous as the name given to the nearby naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a>, in which <a href="Caesar%20Augustus">Octavian</a> won a decisive victory over <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> on September 2, 31 BC.

Actium was situated on the southern side of the strait opposite the later city of <a href="Nicopolis">Nicopolis</a> built by <a href="Caesar%20Augustus">Octavian</a>. Since 2002 the peninsular of Actium has been linked with <a href="Preveza">Preveza</a> on the north shore of the <a href="Ambracian%20Gulf">Ambracian Gulf</a> by the <a href="Aktio-Preveza%20Undersea%20Tunnel">Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel</a>.

Actium belonged originally to the <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>ian colonists of <a href="Anactorium">Anactorium</a>, who probably founded the sanctuary of Apollo Actius. In the 3rd century BC it fell to the <a href="Acarnanians">Acarnanians</a>, who subsequently held their religious summits there.

On the promontory was the ancient sanctuary of <a href="Apollo">Apollo Actius</a>, which was later enlarged by Augustus, and also the town of Actium.

Octavian also ordered a war monument to be constructed to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC on the site of his campsite prior to the naval engagement, near Nicopolis.

Octavian instituted or renewed the games known as <a href="Actia">Actia</a> or <a href="Ludi">Ludi</a> Actiaci, named after Actium in Nicopolis (the new city) to memorialise the battle. Actiaca Aera was a computation of time from the battle.

In 1980 the Greek Ministry of Transport and Communications reported that shipwrecks from the Battle of Actium had been located at Actium near the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf.

In summer 2009 archaeologists discovered the ruins of the Temple of Apollo and found two statue heads, one of Apollo, one of Artemis (Diana).

Amway

Amway (short for "American Way") is an American company specializing in the use of <a href="multi-level%20marketing">multi-level marketing</a> to sell health, beauty, and <a href="home%20care">home care</a> products. The company was founded in 1959 by <a href="Jay%20Van%20Andel">Jay Van Andel</a> and <a href="Richard%20DeVos">Richard DeVos</a> and is based in <a href="Ada%2C%20Michigan">Ada, Michigan</a>.

Amway and its sister companies under <a href="Alticor">Alticor</a> reported sales of $9.5 billion in 2015. It conducts business through a number of affiliated companies in more than a hundred countries and territories. Amway was ranked No. 29 among the largest <a href="privately-held%20company">privately held</a> companies in the United States by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" in 2015 based on revenue, and No. 1 among multi-level marketing companies by "<a href="Direct%20Selling%20News">Direct Selling News</a>" in 2016.

Amway has been investigated in various countries and by institutions such as the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC) for alleged <a href="pyramid%20scheme">pyramid scheme</a> practices.

Jay Van Andel and Richard DeVos had been friends since school days and business partners in various endeavors, including a hamburger stand, an air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949, they were introduced to the Nutrilite Products Corporation by Van Andel's second cousin Neil Maaskant. DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for <a href="Nutrilite">Nutrilite</a> food supplements in August. They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. They traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar soon after, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor. They watched promotional filmstrips and listened to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, then they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop the business further.

Earlier in 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed the Ja-Ri Corporation (abbreviated from their respective first names) to import wooden goods from South American countries. After the Chicago seminar, they turned Ja-Ri into a Nutrilite distributorship instead. In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite offered <a href="Commission%20%28remuneration%29">commissions</a> on sales made by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system known as <a href="multi-level%20marketing">multi-level marketing</a> or network marketing. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of more than 5,000 distributors. However, they and some of their top distributors formed the American Way Association, or Amway, in April 1959 in response to concerns about the stability of Nutrilite and in order to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.

Their first product was called Frisk, a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner). They subsequently formed the Amway Sales Corporation to procure and inventory products and to handle sales and marketing plans, and the Amway Services Corporation to handle insurance and other benefits for distributors. In 1960, they purchased a 50% share in Atco Manufacturing Company in Detroit, the original manufacturers of LOC, and changed its name to Amway Manufacturing Corporation. In 1964, the Amway Sales Corporation, Amway Services Corporation, and Amway Manufacturing Corporation merged to form the Amway Corporation.

Amway bought control of Nutrilite in 1972 and full ownership in 1994.

Amway expanded to Australia in 1971, to parts of Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> in 1987, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in 2006.

In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named <a href="Alticor">Alticor</a>, and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named <a href="Quixtar">Quixtar</a>, <a href="Access%20Business%20Group">Access Business Group</a>, and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by <a href="Fulton%20Innovation">Fulton Innovation</a>, pursued research and development and <a href="Access%20Business%20Group">Access Business Group</a> handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third-party clients.

The main difference was that all "Independent Business Owners" (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their <a href="upline">upline</a> "direct distributor", and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18- to 24-month period in favor of a unified Amway brand (<a href="Amway%20Global">Amway Global</a>) worldwide.

In 2006, Quixtar published "The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan", in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for "Active" IBOs was $115.

According to the Amway website, the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia. The top 10 markets for Amway in 2015 were China, South Korea, United States, Japan, Thailand, Russia, Malaysia, India and Ukraine.

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.


Amway China launched in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal <a href="pyramid%20scheme">pyramid scheme</a>s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all <a href="direct%20selling">direct selling</a> companies, including Amway. After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, <a href="Avon%20Products%2C%20Inc.">Avon</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Kay">Mary Kay</a> continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force. China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the United States, salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2 billion in annual sales. In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked No.88 by "Forbes" magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women. In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of 17 billion yuan (US$2.5 billion). According to a report in "Bloomberg Businessweek" in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and $3 billion in revenue.

Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent SA8 added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line <a href="Artistry%20%28cosmetics%29">Artistry</a> (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the United States, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in Brazil, Mexico and the United States (California and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington State</a>). Amway brands include Artistry, Atmosphere, Body Blends, Bodykey, Body Works, Clear Now, eSpring, <a href="Glister%20%28brand%29">Glister</a>, iCook, Legacy of Clean, Nutrilite, Peter Island, Perfect Empowered Drinking Water, Personal Accents, Ribbon, Satinique, Artistry Men and <a href="XS%20Energy%20Drink">XS</a>.

In 2015, the vitamins and weight management products accounted for 46 percent of Alticor's sales. Beauty and personal care products represented 25 percent of sales while durable products, such as eSpring water treatment systems and Atmosphere air treatment systems, represented 16 percent of sales. Home care products generated 7 percent of sales.

According to <a href="Euromonitor%20International">Euromonitor International</a>, Amway sells more products with a satisfaction guarantee than any other direct seller.

Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, SA8 laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of "<a href="Consumer%20Reports">Consumer Reports</a>", SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent. "Consumer Reports" did, however, criticize SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway. Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. "Consumer Reports" program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can "go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money".

Amway's health and beauty brands include Artistry, Satinique, Hymm, Body Series, Glister, "Moiskin" (South America), Nutrilite, "Nutriway" (Scandinavia and Australia/New Zealand), "Attitude" (India), eSpring, "Atmosphere" and "iCook" as well as "XL" and XS Energy drinks. Other Amway brands that were discontinued or replaced include Tolsom, Eddie Funkhouser New York, or beautycycle (Eastern Europe).

Amway's Artistry products include skin care, cosmetics, and <a href="anti-aging%20cream">anti-aging cream</a>s and serums. In 2011, Artistry brand reached sales of $2.8 billion. According to <a href="Euromonitor%20International">Euromonitor International</a>, the Artistry brand was among the world's top five, largest selling, premium skincare brands, and among the world's top ten, largest selling, premium cosmetic brands in 2014–2015.

Amway's largest selling brand is the Nutrilite range of health supplements (marketed as Nutriway in some countries), and in 2008 Nutrilite sales exceeded $3 billion globally. In 2001, five Nutrilite products were the first dietary supplements to be certified by <a href="NSF%20International">NSF International</a>. In 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 in the nutrient and health food category, Nutrilite won "Platinum" and "Gold" awards in Malaysia, China, Taiwan, Thailand, and Asia overall in the "Reader's Digest" "Trusted Brands of Asia" survey. In 2008 Nutrilite scientists, in partnership with Alticor subsidiary <a href="Interleukin%20Genetics">Interleukin Genetics</a> won the 12th John M. Kinney Award for Nutrition and Metabolism for their research into the interaction between nutrition and genetics.

In 2011, Nutrilite brand of vitamins and dietary supplements led Amway's sales, totaling almost $4.7 billion. According to <a href="Euromonitor%20International">Euromonitor International</a>, in 2014, Nutrilite was the world's No. 1 selling vitamins and dietary supplements brand. In 2015, it was reported that according to Euromonitor International, Amway was the largest vitamin and dietary supplement vendor in China, with 11% of a market that generated 100 billion yuan ($15.6 billion) in annual sales. In 2015, it was reported that according to China Confidential consumer brands survey, Amway Nutrilite was the most popular vitamin and dietary supplement brand in China.

In January 2009, Amway announced a voluntary <a href="Product%20recall">recall</a> of Nutrilite and XS Energy Bars after learning that they had possibly been manufactured with <a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>-contaminated ingredients from <a href="Peanut%20Corporation%20of%20America">Peanut Corporation of America</a>. The company indicated that it had not received any reports of illness in connection with the products.

In 2012, the <a href="Center%20for%20Science%20in%20the%20Public%20Interest">Center for Science in the Public Interest</a> (CSPI), accused Amway of making unsubstantiated and illegal claims about Nutrilite Fruits & Vegetables 2GO Twist Tubes and threatened to launch a class action lawsuit against the company unless it took remedial action. Amway responded that the claims made about the products were properly substantiated and that they did not plan to change the product's labeling but nevertheless would review the statements that CSPI has questioned. CSPI later reported that Amway had agreed to changing product labels by the end of 2014.

Amway's eSpring water filter was introduced in 2000. According to Amway, it was the first system to combine a <a href="Carbon%20filtering">carbon block filter</a> and <a href="ultraviolet%20disinfection">ultraviolet light</a> with electronic-monitoring technology in the filter cartridge and it became the first home system to achieve certification for <a href="ANSI">ANSI</a>/NSF Standards 42, 53, and 55. According to Amway, eSpring was the first water treatment system to receive certification for all fifteen NSF/<a href="ANSI">ANSI</a> 401 contaminants which include pharmaceuticals, pesticides and herbicides. The company also claims that, in addition to these 15 contaminants, eSpring is certified for more than 145 potential contaminants, including lead and mercury.

eSpring was the first commercial product which employed Fulton Innovation's <a href="eCoupled">eCoupled</a> wireless power induction technology. In December 2006, Amway sister company, Fulton Innovations, announced that it would introduce eCoupled technology in other consumer electronic products at the 2007 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>.

In 2013, eSpring was one of the Reader's Digest Trusted Brands Award winners in the water purifiers category in Malaysia. In 2015, Amway was recognized for the sixth consecutive year by <a href="Frost%20%26amp%3B%20Sullivan">Frost & Sullivan</a> as Asia Pacific Water Filtration company of the year. According to an Amway commissioned study of global sales conducted by marketing research firm Verify Markets, eSpring was the world's largest selling brand of kitchen water treatment systems and home water treatment systems in 2014.

On January 14, 2015, Amway announced that it had acquired XS Energy, a California-based brand of energy drinks and snacks. The XS Energy brand has been sold as an Amway product since 2003. As of January 2015, it has been distributed in 38 countries, generating annual sales of $150 million.

Amway combines direct selling with a <a href="multi-level%20marketing">multi-level marketing</a> strategy. Amway distributors, referred to as "independent business owners" (IBOs), may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated. People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices. <a href="Harvard%20Business%20School">Harvard Business School</a>, which described Amway as "one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world", noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos "accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors".

In December 2006, Alticor secured the <a href="naming%20rights">naming rights</a> for the <a href="Orlando%20Magic">Orlando Magic</a>'s home basketball arena in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a>, Florida. The Orlando Magic are owned by the DeVos family. The arena, formerly known as the TD Waterhouse Centre, was renamed the <a href="Amway%20Arena">Amway Arena</a>. Its successor, the <a href="Amway%20Center">Amway Center</a>, was opened in 2010, and the older arena was demolished in 2012.

In 2009, Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> team to become the jersey sponsor.

In March 2009, Amway Global signed a multi-year deal to become the presenting partner of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Sol">Los Angeles Sol</a> of <a href="Women%27s%20Professional%20Soccer">Women's Professional Soccer</a>. The deal, however, would last only one year, as the Sol folded the next year.

In 2011 Amway signed a three-year deal to be the presenting sponsor of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>'s <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>.

Since 2012, Amway has been the <a href="Sponsor%20%28commercial%29">title sponsor</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Championship">Canadian Championship</a>, an annual soccer tournament.

In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201994">1994 political campaign</a> of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor <a href="Sue%20Myrick">Sue Myrick</a> (N.C.). According to two reports by "<a href="Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29">Mother Jones</a>" magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager "used the company's extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871" to Myrick's campaign. According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes. Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained "close ties to Amway and Yager", and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, "most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors", in the 1997–98 election cycle.

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election, $2.5 million to the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>, and was the number one corporate political donor in the United States. In the <a href="2004%20Elections">2004 election cycle</a>, the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative <a href="527%20group">527 group</a>, <a href="Progress%20for%20America">Progress for America</a>.

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3 million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3 million to pay for Republican "infomercials" and televising of the GOP convention on <a href="Pat%20Robertson">Pat Robertson</a>'s <a href="Family%20Channel">Family Channel</a>, but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.

In April 1997 Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1 million to the Republican National Committee (RNC), which at the time was the second-largest <a href="Campaign%20finance%20in%20the%20United%20States">soft-money</a> donation ever, behind Amway's 1994 gift of $2.5 million to the RNC. In July 1997, <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a> <a href="Trent%20Lott">Trent Lott</a> and <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted Amway and four other companies a tax break on their Asian branches that totaled $19 million.

In a column published in the "<a href="Fort%20Worth%20Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>" newspaper in August 1997, reporter <a href="Molly%20Ivins">Molly Ivins</a> wrote that Amway had "its own <a href="Congressional%20caucus">caucus</a> in Congress...Five Republican House members are also Amway distributors: Reps. Sue Myrick of North Carolina, <a href="Jon%20Christensen">Jon Christensen</a> of Nebraska, <a href="Dick%20Chrysler">Dick Chrysler</a> of Michigan, <a href="Richard%20Pombo">Richard Pombo</a> of California, and <a href="John%20Ensign">John Ensign</a> of Nevada. Their informal caucus meets several times a year with Amway bigwigs to discuss policy matters affecting the company, including China's trade status."

A 1998 analysis of campaign contributions conducted by "<a href="Businessweek">Businessweek</a>" found that Amway, along with the founding families and some top distributors, had donated at least $7 million to GOP causes in the preceding decade. Political candidates who received campaign funding from Amway in 1998 included Representatives <a href="Bill%20Redmond">Bill Redmond</a> (R–N.M.), <a href="Heather%20Wilson">Heather Wilson</a> (R–N.M.), and Jon Christensen (R–Neb).

According to a report by the <a href="Center%20for%20Public%20Integrity">Center for Public Integrity</a>, in the 2004 election cycle, members of the Van Andel and DeVos families were the second, third and fifth largest donors to the Republican party.

<a href="Dick%20DeVos">Dick DeVos</a>, son of Amway founder Richard DeVos and past president of the company, served as Finance Chairman of the Republican National Committee, and his wife <a href="Betsy%20DeVos">Betsy DeVos</a> served as chair of the <a href="Michigan%20Republican%20Party">Michigan Republican Party</a> from 1996 to 2000 and 2003 to 2005.

In May 2005, Dick DeVos ran against incumbent Governor <a href="Jennifer%20Granholm">Jennifer Granholm</a> in <a href="Michigan%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202006">Michigan's 2006 gubernatorial election</a>. DeVos was defeated by Granholm, who won 56% of the popular vote to DeVos' 42%.

In August 2012, gay rights activist <a href="Fred%20Karger">Fred Karger</a> began a movement to boycott Amway in protest of the contribution from a private foundation of Amway President <a href="Doug%20DeVos">Doug DeVos</a> to the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Marriage">National Organization for Marriage</a>, a political organization which opposes legalization of <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> in the United States.

Several sources have commented on the promotion of <a href="Christian%20right">Christian conservative</a> ideology within the Amway organization. "<a href="Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29">Mother Jones</a>" magazine described the Amway distributor force as "heavily influenced by the company's dual themes of Christian morality and free enterprise" and operating "like a private political army". In "The Cult of Free Enterprise", Stephen Butterfield, who spent time in the Yager group within Amway, wrote "[Amway] sells a marketing and motivational system, a cause, a way of life, in a fervid emotional atmosphere of rallies and political religious revivalism." "<a href="Philadelphia%20City%20Paper">Philadelphia City Paper</a>" correspondent Maryam Henein stated that "The language used in motivational tools for Amway frequently echoes or directly quotes the Bible, with the unstated assumption of a shared Christian perspective."

"<a href="Businessweek">Businessweek</a>" correspondents Bill Vlasic and Beth Regan characterized the founding families of Amway as "fervently conservative, fervently Christian, and hugely influential in the Republican Party", noting that "Rich DeVos charged up the troops with a message of Christian beliefs and rock-ribbed conservatism."

High-ranking Amway leaders such as Richard DeVos and Dexter Yager were owners and members of the board of <a href="Gospel%20Films">Gospel Films</a>, a producer of movies and books geared towards conservative Christians, as well as co-owners (along with <a href="Salem%20Communications">Salem Communications</a>) of a right-wing, Christian nonprofit called Gospel Communications International. Yager, interviewed on "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" in 1983, admitted that he promotes Christianity through his Amway group, but stated that this might not be the case in other Amway groups.

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>'s" Bob Moser reported that former Amway CEO and co-founder Richard DeVos is connected with the <a href="Dominionist">Dominionist</a> political movement in the United States. Moser states that DeVos was a supporter of the late <a href="D.%20James%20Kennedy">D. James Kennedy</a>, giving more than $5 million to Kennedy's <a href="Coral%20Ridge%20Ministries">Coral Ridge Ministries</a>. DeVos was also a founding member and two-time president of the <a href="Council%20for%20National%20Policy">Council for National Policy</a>, a right-wing Christian organization.

Sociologist <a href="David%20G.%20Bromley">David G. Bromley</a> calls Amway a "quasi-religious corporation" having <a href="sectarian">sectarian</a> characteristics. Bromley and <a href="Anson%20Shupe">Anson Shupe</a> view Amway as preaching the <a href="Prosperity%20theology">gospel of prosperity</a>. Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, of the consulting firm Thinkalytics, LLC, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as "cults" and have speculated that they engage in "mind control", there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.

Amway co-founder <a href="Jay%20Van%20Andel">Jay Van Andel</a> (in 1980), and later his son Steve Van Andel (in 2001), were elected by the board of directors of the <a href="United%20States%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">United States Chamber of Commerce</a> to be the chairman of the private <a href="lobbying">American lobbying</a> organization.

In 2006 Amway (then Quixtar in North America) introduced its "Professional Development Accreditation Program" in response to concerns surrounding business support materials (BSM), including books, tapes and meetings. In 2010 this was superseded by its "Accreditation Plus" program to ensure that all BSM content is consistent with Amway's quality assurance standards, which approved providers of BSM must abide by. The quality assurance standards state that

<a href="Robert%20Todd%20Carroll">Robert Carroll</a>, of the "<a href="Skeptic%27s%20Dictionary">Skeptic's Dictionary</a>", has described Amway as a "legal pyramid scheme", and has said that the quasi-religious devotion of its affiliates is used by the company to conceal poor performance rates by distributors.

In a 1979 ruling, the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> found that Amway did not fit the definition of a pyramid scheme because (a) distributors were not paid to recruit people, (b) it did not require distributors to buy a large stock of unmoving inventory, (c) distributors were required to maintain retail sales (at least 10 per month), and (d) the company and all distributors were required to accept returns of excess inventory from down-level distributors.

The FTC did, however, find Amway "guilty of <a href="price-fixing">price-fixing</a> and making exaggerated income claims"; the company was ordered to stop retail price fixing and allocating customers among distributors and was prohibited from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve with the business. Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month. The order was violated with a 1986 ad campaign, resulting in a $100,000 fine.

Studies of independent consumer watchdog agencies have shown that between 990 and 999 of 1000 participants in MLMs that use Amway-type pay plans in fact lose money. According to The Skeptic's Dictionary, "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission requires Amway to label its products with the message that 54% of Amway recruits make nothing and the rest earn on average $65 a month."

In September 2006, following a public complaint, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> state police (CID) initiated raids and seizures against Amway distributors in the state, and submitted a petition against them, claiming the company violated the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (banning) Act. They shut down all corporate offices associated with the Amway organization including the offices of some Amway distributors. The enforcement said that the business model of the company is illegal. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had notified the police that Amway in India may be violating certain laws regarding a "money circulation scheme" and the <a href="International%20Business%20Times">"IB Times"</a> article writes that "some say ... Amway is really more about making money from recruiting people to become distributors, as opposed to selling products". In 2008, the state government of Andhra Pradesh enacted a ban on Amway media advertisements.

On August 6, 2011, <a href="Kerala%20Police">Kerala Police</a> sealed the offices of Amway at <a href="Kozhikode">Kozhikode</a>, <a href="Kannur">Kannur</a>, <a href="Kochi">Kochi</a>, <a href="Kottayam">Kottayam</a>, <a href="Thrissur">Thrissur</a>, <a href="Kollam">Kollam</a> and <a href="Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a> following complaints. On November 2012, The Economic Offences Wing of Kerala Police, conducted searches at the offices of Amway at Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur as part of its crackdown on money chain activities and closed down the firm's godowns at these centres. Products valued at Rs.2.14 crore were also seized. Later, Area manager of Amway, P. M. Rajkumar, who was arrested following searches was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

On May 27, 2013, Crime Branch officials of <a href="Kerala%20Police">Kerala Police</a> arrested William S. Pinckney, Managing Director & CEO of Amway India Enterprises along with two other directors of the company from <a href="Kozhikode">Kozhikode</a>. The three were arrested on charges of running a pyramid scheme. They were granted bail the next day and the business was unaffected. On June 8, 2013, Kozhikode Court lifted the freeze on Amway offices in Kerala. On May 26, 2014, Pinckney was arrested by <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> police on the basis of a consumer complaint that alleged unethical circulation of money by Amway. He was subsequently arrested in other criminal cases registered against him in the state on allegations of financial irregularities by the company. Pinckney was jailed for two months until being released on bail".

On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56 million – $34 million in cash and $22 million in products – to settle a <a href="class%20action">class action</a> that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007. The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, <a href="racketeering">racketeering</a>, and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme.

While noting that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability, Amway acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which was expected in early 2011. The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100 million.

A 2009 class action case lodged in Canada was rejected by the <a href="Federal%20Court%20%28Canada%29">Federal Court</a> and confirmed on appeal by the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Canada%29">Federal Court of Appeal</a>, with costs awarded to Amway and the plaintiffs directed to <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a>.

In 1982, Amway co-founders, Richard M. DeVos and Jay Van Andel, along with Amway's executive vice president for corporate services, William J. Mr. Discher Jr., were indicted in Canada on several criminal charges, including allegations that they underreported the value of goods brought into the country and had defrauded the Canadian government of more than $28 million from 1965 to 1980. The charges were dropped in 1983 after Amway and its Canadian subsidiary pleaded guilty to criminal customs fraud charges. The companies paid a fine of $25 million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989 the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45 million CAD. In a 1994 article authored by DeVos, he stated that the guilty plea was entered for technical reasons, despite believing they were innocent of the charges, and that he believed that the case had been motivated by "political reasons".

The <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on "highly profitable" training videotapes. Amway denied wrongdoing, blaming the case on a misunderstanding by distributors, and settled the case out of court for $9 million. In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of three of the five of those distributors.

In 2007, Amway's operations were halted in the United Kingdom and Ireland following a yearlong investigation by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which moved to have Amway banned on the basis that the company had employed deceptive marketing, presented inflated earnings estimates, and lured distributors into buying bogus "motivation and training" tools. In 2008, a UK judge dismissed government claims against Amway's operations, saying major reforms in the prior year (which included banning non-Amway approved motivational events and materials) had fixed company faults that favored selling training materials over products and misrepresented earnings. However, the judge also expressed his belief that Amway allowed "misrepresentations" of its business by independent sellers in years past and failed to act decisively against the misrepresentations.

In 1997, Amway Poland and <a href="Network%20TwentyOne">Network TwentyOne</a> separately sued the makers of a Polish film, "Welcome to Life" (), for defamation and copyright violations. Henryk Dederki (the director) and producer were later acquitted on the charge of disseminating false information. The film, banned for 12 years, was one of the highly anticipated movies of 2009's Warsaw Film Festival and was dubbed by the promoters as a "scary movie about brainwashing" It was said to depict hard-sell "<a href="pep%20rallies">pep rallies</a>", and to include statements from distributors that meetings had a similar tone to meetings of the <a href="Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a> before it lost power in Poland. Methods of recruitment that confusingly resembled those of a sect were also described. A bestseller on the local video <a href="black%20market">black market</a>, the film was banned while the suit proceeded.

In 2001 a regional court ruled in favor of Network 21; however, in 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed Amway's civil lawsuit. On appeal Amway won the case and the producers were ordered to pay a fine to a children's charity and publish a public apology. the film was still banned due to an ongoing case brought by "private individuals" ridiculed in the film.

On December 18, 2012, the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove "untrue information", as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors. This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.

In March 2004, TV personality <a href="Phil%20McGraw">Phil McGraw</a> (a.k.a. Dr. Phil) pulled his "Shape Up" line of supplements off the market in the face of an investigation by the <a href="U.S.%20Federal%20Trade%20Commission">U.S. Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC). The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a <a href="subsidiary">subsidiary</a> of <a href="Alticor">Alticor</a>'s Access Business Group. The FTC later dropped the probe, but in October 2005 a <a href="class-action%20lawsuit">class-action lawsuit</a> was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss. In September 2006, a $10.5 million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5 million in cash and $6 million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.

Some Amway distributors distributed an <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> that the (old) <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble%23Logo%20myth">Procter & Gamble service mark</a> was in fact a <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a> symbol or that the CEO of P&G is himself a practicing <a href="Satanist">Satanist</a>. (In some variants of the story, it is also claimed that the CEO of Procter & Gamble donated "satanic tithes" to the <a href="Church%20of%20Satan">Church of Satan</a>.) Procter & Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the story in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the company for <a href="defamation">defamation</a> and slander. The distributors had used Amway's Amvox voice messaging service to send the rumor to their downline distributors in April 1995. After more than a decade of lawsuits in multiple states, by 2003 all allegations against Amway and Amway distributors had been dismissed. In October 2005 a Utah appeals court reversed part of the decision dismissing the case against the four Amway distributors, and remanded it to the lower court for further proceedings. On March 20, 2007, Procter & Gamble was awarded $19.25 million by a U.S. District Court jury in Salt Lake City, in the lawsuit against the four former Amway distributors. On November 24, 2008, the case was officially settled.

In January 2017, the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade determined that Amway Vietnam had violated federal regulations by engaging in unauthorized multi-level marketing.

Some Amway distributor groups have been accused of using "<a href="cult">cult</a>-like" tactics to attract new distributors and keep them involved and committed. Allegations include resemblance to a <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%29">Big Brother</a> organization with paranoid attitude to insiders critical of the organization, seminars and rallies resembling religious <a href="revival%20meeting">revival meeting</a>s and enormous involvement of distributors despite minimal incomes. An examination of the 1979–1980 tax records in the state of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> showed that the Direct Distributors reported a net loss of $918 on average.

In 2004, "<a href="Dateline%20NBC">Dateline NBC</a>" featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices of Quixtar. The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the "high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar" are actually "making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar's cosmetics, soaps, and electronics".
"In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don't get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books, tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can't sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed."
The program said that a Quixtar recruiter featured in the report made misleading and inconsistent statements about Quixtar earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding <a href="arrest%20warrant">arrest warrant</a> for cocaine possession from the mid-90s.

In a response to the "Dateline" report, Quixtar published a "Dateline Quixtar Response" on its official website. In its response, Quixtar, among others, stated:
"We learned that two Dateline producers had registered as IBOs and for months had been conducting undercover research for the story, which included using a hidden camera to videotape meetings and conversations with IBOs. The producers did not identify themselves as working for Dateline, instead feigning interest in building a business powered by Quixtar."
The site also stated that:
"Dateline's story on Quixtar boiled down to the complaints of three former Independent Business Owners (IBOs) – one of whom is a competitor – and ignored the hundreds of thousands of IBOs powered by Quixtar who are achieving their goals."

Adam Smith

Adam Smith (16 June 1723 <a href="New%20Style">NS</a> – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher, and author. He was a <a href="Ethics">moral philosopher</a>, a pioneer of <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>, and was a key figure during the <a href="Scottish%20Enlightenment">Scottish Enlightenment</a> era. He is best known for two classic works: "<a href="The%20Theory%20of%20Moral%20Sentiments">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</a>" (1759), and "<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</a>" (1776). The latter, usually abbreviated as "The Wealth of Nations", is considered his "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>" and the first modern work of <a href="economics">economics</a>.

Smith studied <a href="social%20philosophy">social philosophy</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> and at <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot, <a href="John%20Snell">John Snell</a>. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, leading him to collaborate with <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> during the <a href="Scottish%20Enlightenment">Scottish Enlightenment</a>. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy, and during this time he wrote and published "The Theory of Moral Sentiments". In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.

Smith laid the foundations of classical <a href="free%20market">free market</a> economic theory. "The Wealth of Nations" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of <a href="Division%20of%20labour%23Adam%20Smith">division of labour</a>, and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> writers in the moralising tradition of <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>. In 2005, "The Wealth of Nations" was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. The minor planet <a href="12838%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAdamsmith">12838 Adamsmith</a> was named in his memory.

Smith was born in <a href="Kirkcaldy">Kirkcaldy</a>, in the County of <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish <a href="Society%20of%20Writers%20to%20Her%20Majesty%27s%20Signet">"Writer to the Signet"</a> (senior <a href="Solicitor%23Scotland">solicitor</a>), <a href="Advocate%23Scotland">advocate</a>, and <a href="Prosecutor%23Scotland">prosecutor</a> (Judge Advocate) and also served as comptroller of the Customs in Kirkcaldy. In 1720 he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow. The date of Smith's baptism into the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723, and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth, which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist <a href="John%20Rae%20%28biographer%29">John Rae</a>, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the <a href="Burgh%20School%20of%20Kirkcaldy">Burgh School of Kirkcaldy</a>—characterised by Rae as "one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period"—from 1729 to 1737, he learned <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, mathematics, history, and writing.

Smith entered the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> when he was fourteen and studied <a href="moral%20philosophy">moral philosophy</a> under <a href="Francis%20Hutcheson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Hutcheson</a>. Here, Smith developed his passion for <a href="liberty">liberty</a>, <a href="reason">reason</a>, and <a href="free%20speech">free speech</a>. In 1740 Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, under the <a href="Snell%20Exhibition">Snell Exhibition</a>.

Adam Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling. In pageRank.Book V, Chapter II of "The Wealth of Nations", Smith wrote: "In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching."
Smith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>'s "<a href="Treatise%20on%20Human%20Nature">Treatise on Human Nature</a>", and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it. According to William Robert Scott, "The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework." Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>. When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> ended.

In pageRank.Book V of "The Wealth of Nations", Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20England">English universities</a>, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished <a href="Intellectual%23Man%20of%20Letters">men of letters</a> could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>.

Adam Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, <a href="Francis%20Hutcheson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Hutcheson</a>. Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as "the never to be forgotten Hutcheson"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> and influential mentor <a href="Francis%20Hutcheson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Hutcheson</a>.

Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of <a href="Henry%20Home%2C%20Lord%20Kames">Lord Kames</a>. His lecture topics included <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and "<a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a>", and later the subject of "the progress of opulence". On this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of "the obvious and simple system of <a href="Natural%20and%20legal%20rights">natural liberty</a>". While Smith was not adept at <a href="public%20speaking">public speaking</a>, his lectures met with success.

In 1750, he met the philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching <a href="logic">logic</a> courses, and in 1752 he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the <a href="Professor%20of%20Moral%20Philosophy%2C%20Glasgow">head of Moral Philosophy</a> in Glasgow died the next year, Smith took over the position. He worked as an academic for the next thirteen years, which he characterised as "by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]".

Smith published "<a href="The%20Theory%20of%20Moral%20Sentiments">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</a>" in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined "mutual sympathy" as the basis of <a href="Moral%20sense%20theory">moral sentiments</a>. He based his explanation, not on a special "moral sense" as the <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">Third Lord Shaftesbury</a> and Hutcheson had done, nor on <a href="utilitarianism">utility</a> as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentieth-century concept of <a href="empathy">empathy</a>, the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.

Following the publication of "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith. After the publication of "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Smith began to give more attention to <a href="jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for <a href="mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, the <a href="economic%20theory">economic theory</a> that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.

In 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from <a href="Charles%20Townshend">Charles Townshend</a>—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, <a href="Henry%20Scott%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buccleuch">Henry Scott</a>, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term, but his students refused.

Smith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper Polish. He was paid <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher. Smith first travelled as a tutor to <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, France, where he stayed for one and a half years. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he "had begun to write a book to pass away the time". After touring the south of France, the group moved to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where Smith met with the philosopher <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>.

From Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here Smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time; invariably having an effect on his future works. This list included: <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href="Anne%20Robert%20Jacques%20Turgot%2C%20Baron%20de%20Laune">Turgot</a>, <a href="Jean%20le%20Rond%20d%27Alembert">Jean D'Alembert</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Morellet">André Morellet</a>, <a href="Claude%20Adrien%20Helv%C3%A9tius">Helvétius</a>, and, notably, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Quesnay">François Quesnay</a>, the head of the <a href="physiocrats">Physiocratic school</a>. Smith was so impressed with his ideas that he might have dedicated "The Wealth of Nations" to Quesnay had he not died beforehand. Physiocrats were opposed to <a href="mercantilism">mercantilism</a>, the dominating economic theory of the time. Illustrated in their motto <a href="Laissez-faire">Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!</a> (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!). They were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth; merchants and industrialists (manufacturers) did not. This however, did not represent their true school of thought, but was a mere "smoke screen" manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church; arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants.

The wealth of France was virtually destroyed by Louis XIV and <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV</a> in ruinous wars, by aiding the American insurgents against the British, and perhaps most destructive (in terms of public perceptions) was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour. Assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth, the feudal system of agriculture in France was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation. Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of Physiocrats were, "with all [their] imperfections [perhaps], the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy". The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic "classe steril"—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.

In 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter. Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus. There he befriended <a href="Henry%20Moyes">Henry Moyes</a>, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. As well as teaching Moyes, Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and <a href="Thomas%20Reid">Thomas Reid</a> in the young man's education. In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20London">Royal Society of London</a>, and was elected a member of the <a href="The%20Club%20%28dining%20club%29">Literary Club</a> in 1775. "<a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a>" was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.

In 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in <a href="Panmure%20House">Panmure House</a> in Edinburgh's <a href="Canongate">Canongate</a>. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Edinburgh">Royal Society of Edinburgh</a>, and from 1787 to 1789 he occupied the honorary position of Lord <a href="Rector%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Glasgow">Rector of the University of Glasgow</a>. He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the <a href="Canongate%20Kirkyard">Canongate Kirkyard</a>. On his death bed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.

Smith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist <a href="Joseph%20Black">Joseph Black</a>, and the pioneering geologist <a href="James%20Hutton">James Hutton</a>. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished "History of Astronomy" as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as "<a href="Essays%20on%20Philosophical%20Subjects">Essays on Philosophical Subjects</a>".

Smith's library went by his will to <a href="David%20Douglas%2C%20Lord%20Reston">David Douglas, Lord Reston</a> (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Reverend W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor <a href="Robert%20Oliver%20Cunningham">Robert Oliver Cunningham</a> of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church), Edinburgh, and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.

Not much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request. He never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, whom he lived with after his return from France and who died six years before his own death.

Smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of "inexpressible benignity". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanning</a> factory, and while discussing <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>, Smith walked into a huge <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanning pit</a> from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.

<a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a> who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the <a href="The%20Club%20%28Literary%20Club%29">Literary Club</a>, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, and so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Sir Joshua Reynolds</a> that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.

Smith has been alternately described as someone who "had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment" and one whose "countenance was manly and agreeable." Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, "I am a beau in nothing but my books." Smith rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by <a href="James%20Tassie">James Tassie</a> and two <a href="etching">etching</a>s by <a href="John%20Kay%20%28caricaturist%29">John Kay</a>. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th century reprints of "The Wealth of Nations" were based largely on Tassie's medallion.

There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>.

Anglo-American economist <a href="Ronald%20Coase">Ronald Coase</a> has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the "<a href="Great%20Architect%20of%20the%20Universe">Great Architect of the Universe</a>", later scholars such as <a href="Jacob%20Viner">Jacob Viner</a> have "very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God", a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the "Wealth of Nations" in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the "great phenomena of nature", such as "the generation, the life, growth and dissolution of plants and animals", has led men to "enquire into their causes", and that "superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods".

Some other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.

Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to <a href="William%20Strahan%20%28publisher%29">William Strahan</a>, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.

In 1759, Smith published his first work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," sold by co-publishers <a href="Andrew%20Millar">Andrew Millar</a> of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh. Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book, up until his death. Although "The Wealth of Nations" is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, it is believed that Smith himself considered "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" to be a superior work.

In the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek "mutual sympathy of sentiments." His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve "mutual sympathy of sentiments" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behavior, which come to constitute one's conscience.

Some scholars have perceived a conflict between "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and "The Wealth of Nations"; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the "impartial spectator" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and "The Wealth of Nations" as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. <a href="James%20Otteson">Otteson</a> argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar "market model" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. <a href="Robert%20Ekelund">Ekelund</a> and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that "in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest."

There is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's <a href="invisible%20hand">invisible hand</a>, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – pageRank.Book IV, Chapter II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the "wealth of nations" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.

Smith used the term "<a href="invisible%20hand">the invisible hand</a>" in "History of Astronomy" referring to "the invisible hand of Jupiter," and once in each of his <a href="The%20Theory%20of%20Moral%20Sentiments">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</a> (1759) and <a href="The%20Wealth%20of%20Nations">The Wealth of Nations</a> (1776). This last statement about "an invisible hand" has been interpreted in numerous ways.

As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.

Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:

It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.

Smith's statement about the benefits of "an invisible hand" may be meant to answer <a href="Bernard%20Mandeville">Mandeville's</a> contention that "Private Vices … may be turned into Public Benefits". It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their "conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices". Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or <a href="Monopoly">monopolies</a>, fixing the highest price "which can be squeezed out of the buyers". Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants "...in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public...The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention." Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:

It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. ("The Wealth of Nations," I.i.10)

The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about "an invisible hand" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of <a href="neoclassical%20economics">neoclassical economics</a> and its concept of <a href="General%20equilibrium%20theory">general equilibrium</a> – <a href="Paul%20Samuelson">Samuelson's</a> "Economics" refers six times to Smith's "invisible hand". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson quotes Smith's "invisible hand" statement substituting "general interest" for "public interest". Samuelson concludes: "Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market."

Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote "The Wealth of Nations". Using the <a href="Physiocracy">physiocratical</a> concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Quesnay">Quesnay</a>. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced in order to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a>. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—"general plenty" and "universal opulence"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures "The Wealth of Nations". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the "Wealth of Nations" summarise this policy:

The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes … . [T]his produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;

Smith added, however, that the "abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter."

<a href="Alfred%20Marshall">Alfred Marshall</a> criticised Smith's definition of economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The "invisible hand" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small ("atomistic") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> and <a href="oligopoly">oligopoly</a>, the "invisible hand" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Stiglitz">Joseph E. Stiglitz</a> says, on the topic of one of Smith's better known ideas: "the reason that the <a href="invisible%20hand">invisible hand</a> often seems invisible is that it is often not there."

Shortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published "Essays on Philosophical Subjects", a history of <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on <a href="ancient%20physics">ancient physics</a> and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. "<a href="Lectures%20on%20Jurisprudence">Lectures on Jurisprudence</a>" were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of "The Wealth of Nations", published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include "Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms" (1763) (first published in 1896); and "Essays on Philosophical Subjects" (1795).

"The Wealth of Nations" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, "The Wealth of Nations" was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. Former UK Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, it is said, used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag.

In light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in <a href="mercantilism">mercantilism</a> began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, Britain embraced free trade and Smith's laissez-faire economics, and via the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade.

<a href="George%20Stigler">George Stigler</a> attributes to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in <a href="Economic%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.

<a href="Paul%20Samuelson">Paul Samuelson</a> finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the <a href="general%20equilibrium">general equilibrium</a> modelling of <a href="Walras">Walras</a> a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.

<a href="Joseph%20Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a> criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: "His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along."

Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the "<a href="labour%20theory%20of%20value%23The%20theory%27s%20development">labour theory of value</a>". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s major work, "Capital", was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of <a href="neoclassical%20economics">neoclassical economics</a>, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.

The body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or "<a href="marginalism%23The%20Marginal%20Revolution">marginalism</a>" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term "economics" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as <a href="Alfred%20Marshall">Alfred Marshall</a> as a concise synonym for "economic science" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term "<a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>" used by Smith. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s. Neoclassical economics systematised <a href="supply%20and%20demand">supply and demand</a> as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the <a href="labour%20theory%20of%20value">labour theory of value</a> of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a <a href="marginal%20utility">marginal utility</a> theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.

The bicentennial anniversary of the publication of "The Wealth of Nations" was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both "The Wealth of Nations" and "The Theory of Moral Sentiments", and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His "<a href="homo%20economicus">homo economicus</a>" or "economic man" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in "The Secret History of the Dismal Science" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The "Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.

Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:

Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (…) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

Smith's chapter on colonies in turn would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-nineteenth century onward. "The Wealth of Nations" would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's thirteen American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and, by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.

Smith's most prominent disciple in nineteenth-century Britain, peace advocate <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a>, preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the <a href="Anti-Corn%20Law%20League">Anti-Corn Law League</a> in overturning the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a> in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire "on the cheap" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as <a href="Cobdenism">Cobdenism</a> or the <a href="Manchester%20Liberalism">Manchester School</a>. By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as <a href="Joseph%20Shield%20Nicholson">Joseph Shield Nicholson</a> would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation. As Marc-William Palen notes: "On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before." Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.

Smith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>50 notes issued by the <a href="Clydesdale%20Bank">Clydesdale Bank</a> in Scotland, and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A320%20note">£20 notes</a> issued by the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>, making him the first Scotsman to feature on an <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20note%20issues">English banknote</a>.

A large-scale memorial of Smith by <a href="Alexander%20Stoddart">Alexander Stoddart</a> was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a -tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the <a href="Royal%20Mile">Royal Mile</a> outside <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BGiles%27%20Cathedral">St Giles' Cathedral</a> in Parliament Square, near the <a href="Mercat%20cross">Mercat cross</a>. 20th-century sculptor <a href="Jim%20Sanborn">Jim Sanborn</a> (best known for the "<a href="Kryptos">Kryptos</a>" sculpture at the United States <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At <a href="Central%20Connecticut%20State%20University">Central Connecticut State University</a> is "Circulating Capital", a tall cylinder which features an extract from "The Wealth of Nations" on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text but represented in <a href="binary%20code">binary code</a>. At the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Charlotte">University of North Carolina at Charlotte</a>, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is "Adam Smith's Spinning Top". Another Smith sculpture is at <a href="Cleveland%20State%20University">Cleveland State University</a>. He also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play "<a href="The%20Low%20Road%20%28play%29">The Low Road</a>", centred on a proponent on laissez-faire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a> and the recession which followed—in the premiere production, he was portrayed by <a href="Bill%20Paterson%20%28actor%29">Bill Paterson</a>.

A bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the <a href="National%20Wallace%20Monument">National Wallace Monument</a> in <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>.

Adam Smith resided at Panmure house from 1778–90. This residence has now been purchased by the <a href="Edinburgh%20Business%20School">Edinburgh Business School</a> at <a href="Heriot%20Watt%20University">Heriot Watt University</a> and fundraising has begun to restore it. Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.

Smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the <a href="Adam%20Smith%20Institute">Adam Smith Institute</a> in London, the Adam Smith Society and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.

<a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> argues that, while Smith did not coin the term "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>", "it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions". Greenspan continues that "The Wealth of Nations" was "one of the great achievements in human intellectual history". <a href="P.%20J.%20O%27Rourke">P. J. O'Rourke</a> describes Smith as the "founder of free market economics".

Other writers have argued that Smith's support for "laissez-faire" (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. <a href="Herbert%20Stein">Herbert Stein</a> wrote that the people who "wear an Adam Smith necktie" do it to "make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and <a href="limited%20government">limited government</a>", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith "was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie." In Stein's reading, "The Wealth of Nations" could justify the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>, the <a href="Consumer%20Product%20Safety%20Commission">Consumer Product Safety Commission</a>, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and "<a href="Pigovian%20tax">discriminatory taxation</a> to deter <a href="sin%20tax">improper</a> or <a href="sumptuary%20tax">luxurious behavior</a>".

Similarly, Vivienne Brown stated in "<a href="The%20Economic%20Journal">The Economic Journal</a>" that in the 20th century United States, <a href="Reaganomics">Reaganomics</a> supporters, the "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>", and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an "extreme dogmatic defender of "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>" capitalism and <a href="supply-side%20economics">supply-side economics</a>". In fact, "The Wealth of Nations" includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:

"The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state."

Some commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them <a href="Luxury%20tax">luxury goods taxes</a> and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the "impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation" ("The Wealth of Nations," V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting "justice" and "certain publick institutions" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise ("The Wealth of Nations," IV.ix.51).

Additionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in "The Wealth of Nations, pageRank.Book V, Ch. I". Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" ("Wealth of Nations," V.i.d.18). Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a <a href="doge">doge</a>". In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:

"The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods."

He added, however, that in general a retaliatory tariff "seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them" ("The Wealth of Nations," IV.ii.39).

<a href="Economic%20historian">Economic historian</a>s such as <a href="Jacob%20Viner">Jacob Viner</a> regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called "natural liberty") but not as a dogmatic supporter of "laissez-faire".

Economist <a href="Daniel%20B.%20Klein">Daniel Klein</a> believes using the term "free market economics" or "free market economist" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the "Smithian" identity. Economist <a href="David%20Ricardo">David Ricardo</a> set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.

Some have also claimed, <a href="Emma%20Rothschild">Emma Rothschild</a> among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage, although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:

The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. ("The Wealth of Nations", pageRank.Book 1, Chapter 8)

However, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an <a href="equality%20of%20bargaining%20power">imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power</a>:
A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate.

Antoine Lavoisier

Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (also Antoine Lavoisier after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>; ; 26 August 17438 May 1794;) was a <a href="French%20nobleman">French nobleman</a> and <a href="chemist">chemist</a> central to the 18th-century <a href="chemical%20revolution">chemical revolution</a> and had a large influence on both the <a href="history%20of%20chemistry">history of chemistry</a> and the <a href="history%20of%20biology">history of biology</a>. He is widely considered in popular literature as the "<a href="List%20of%20people%20considered%20father%20or%20mother%20of%20a%20scientific%20field">father of modern chemistry</a>".

It is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> plays in <a href="combustion">combustion</a>. He recognized and named <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (1778) and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> (1783) and opposed the <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>. Lavoisier helped construct the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>, wrote the first extensive <a href="history%20of%20the%20periodic%20table%23Antoine-Laurent%20de%20Lavoisier">list of elements</a>, and helped to reform <a href="chemical%20nomenclature">chemical nomenclature</a>. He predicted the existence of <a href="silicon">silicon</a> (1787) and was also the first to establish that <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> was an element (1777) rather than a compound. He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, <a href="Conservation%20of%20mass">its mass always remains the same</a>.

Lavoisier was a powerful member of a number of <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> councils, and an administrator of the "<a href="Ferme%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">Ferme générale</a>". The "Ferme générale" was one of the most hated components of the "<a href="Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime">Ancien Régime</a>" because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>, and was <a href="guillotined">guillotined</a>.

Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parliament of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother. Lavoisier began his schooling at the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20des%20Quatre-Nations">Collège des Quatre-Nations</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> (also known as the Collège Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760–1761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="botany">botany</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of <a href="Abb%C3%A9%20Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a>, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a <a href="law%20degree">law degree</a> and was admitted to the <a href="bar%20association">bar</a>, but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time.

Lavoisier's education was filled with the ideals of the French <a href="The%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> of the time, and he was fascinated by <a href="Pierre%20Macquer">Pierre Macquer</a>'s dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Condillac">Étienne Condillac</a>, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under <a href="Jean-%C3%89tienne%20Guettard">Jean-Étienne Guettard</a>. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of <a href="Alsace-Lorraine">Alsace-Lorraine</a> in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>, France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> (hydrated <a href="calcium%20sulfate">calcium sulfate</a>), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban <a href="street%20lighting">street lighting</a>. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences. In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.

While Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public. Lavoisier was a humanitarian – he cared deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences. The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>.

Three years later in 1768, he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring in water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water. But, since the construction never commenced, he instead turned his focus to purifying the water from the Seine. This was the project that interested Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.

He additionally was interested in air quality, and spent some time studying the health risks associated with gunpowder’s effect on the air. In 1772, he performed a study on how to reconstruct the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, after it had been damaged by fire, in a way that would allow proper ventilation and clean air throughout.

At the time, the prisons in Paris were known to be largely unlivable and the prisoners’ treatment inhumane. Lavoisier took part in investigations in 1780 (and again in 1791) on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions, which were largely ignored.

Once a part of the Academy, Lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work. One such project he proposed in 1793 was to better public health on the “insalubrious arts.”

Lavoisier had a vision of public education having roots in “scientific sociability” and philanthropy.

Lavoisier gained a vast majority of his income through buying stock in the <a href="Ferme%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">General Farm</a>, which allowed him to work on science full-time, live comfortably, and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community. (It would also contribute to his demise during the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> many years later.)

It was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time, and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist, so Lavoisier used his wealth to open a very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in France so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research.

He also pushed for public education in the sciences. He founded two organizations, and <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20des%20Arts%20et%20M%C3%A9tiers">Musée des Arts et Métiers</a> which were created to serve as educational tools for the public. Funded by the wealthy and noble, Lycée regularly taught courses to the public beginning in 1793.

At the age of 26, around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the "<a href="Ferme%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">Ferme générale</a>", a <a href="tax%20farming%20%28France%29">tax farming</a> financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme générale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a <a href="Wall%20of%20the%20Ferme%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale">wall</a> around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city. His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution. 
Lavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married <a href="Marie-Anne%20Pierrette%20Paulze">Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze</a>, the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the "Ferme générale". She was to play an important part in Lavoisier's scientific career—notably, she translated English documents for him, including <a href="Richard%20Kirwan">Richard Kirwan</a>'s "Essay on Phlogiston" and <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>'s research. In addition, she assisted him in the laboratory and created many <a href="drawing">sketches</a> and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works. Madame Lavoisier edited and published Antoine's memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry. 

For 3 years following his entry into the "Ferme générale", Lavoisier's scientific activity diminished somewhat, for much of his time was taken up with official "Ferme générale" business. He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the "earthy" sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French <a href="monetary%20system">monetary</a> and taxation system to help the peasants.

The Farmers General held a monopoly of the production, import and sale of tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: "When a spirit of <a href="vitriol">vitriol</a>, "aqua fortis" or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise." Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote "His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated." Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.

Lavoisier urged the establishment of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the <a href="Sologne">Sologne</a>, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of <a href="ergotism">ergotism</a> among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.

Lavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the "Ferme Générale". There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme générale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.

In June 1791 Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to <a href="Pierre%20Samuel%20du%20Pont%20de%20Nemours">Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours</a> to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish his newspaper, "La Correspondance Patriotique". The plan was for this to include both reports of debates in the <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Constituent Assembly</a> as well as papers from the Academy of Sciences. He also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures which in March 1791 recommended the adoption of the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>.The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the <a href="National%20Convention">Convention</a> on 1 August 1793. Lavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793, together with Laplace and several other members, for political reasons. One of his last major works was a proposal to the <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a> for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Lagrange">Joseph Louis Lagrange</a>, which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.

As the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> gained momentum, attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular "Ferme Générale", and it was eventually abolished in March 1791. In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed at the request of <a href="Henri%20Gr%C3%A9goire">Abbé Grégoire</a>. 

On 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defence, refuting the financial accusations, reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court was however inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing their goods, it would recover huge sums for the state. Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris, at the age of 50, along with his 27 co-defendants.

According to a (probably apocryphal) story, the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Coffinhal">Coffinhal</a>: ""La République n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu."" ("The Republic has no need of scientists or chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.") Lavoisier was convicted with summary justice of having plundered the people and the treasury of France, of having adulterated the nation's tobacco with water, and of having supplied the enemies of France with huge sums of money from the national treasury.

Lavoisier's importance to science was expressed by Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying: ""Il ne leur a fallu qu’un moment pour faire tomber cette tête, et cent années peut-être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable."" ("It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like.")

A year and a half after his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. During the <a href="First%20White%20Terror">White Terror</a>, his private belongings were delivered to his widow, a brief note was included, reading "To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted".

About a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Condorcet">Marquis de Condorcet</a>, the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years. Lack of money prevented alterations from being made. The statue was melted down during the Second World War and has not since been replaced. However, one of the main "<a href="lyc%C3%A9e">lycée</a>s" (high schools) in Paris and a street in the <a href="8th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">8th arrondissement</a> are named after Lavoisier, and statues of him are found on the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20de%20Ville%2C%20Paris">Hôtel de Ville</a> and on the façade of the "Cour Napoléon" of the <a href="Palais%20du%20Louvre">Louvre</a>. His name is one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%2072%20names%20on%20the%20Eiffel%20Tower">72 names</a> of eminent French scientists, engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> as well as on buildings around Killian Court at <a href="MIT">MIT</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20MA">Cambridge, MA</a> US.

During late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of <a href="combustion">combustion</a>, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce <a href="phosphoric%20acid">acid spirit of phosphorus</a>, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and went on to add that "what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause."

During 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly "fixed air," and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled "Opuscules physiques et chimiques" (Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of <a href="Joseph%20Black">Joseph Black</a>, the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, <a href="chalk">chalk</a> (<a href="calcium%20carbonate">CaCO</a>), and the caustic form, for example, <a href="quicklime">quicklime</a> (<a href="calcium%20oxide">CaO</a>), lay in the fact that the former contained "fixed air," not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with the charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO.

In the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the <a href="red%20calx">red calx</a> of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance. The result was his famous memoir "On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight", read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>, giving off Black's fixed air in the process. When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air, and that it was the air itself "undivided, without alteration, without decomposition" which combined with metals on calcination.

After returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was "five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air." He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.

Lavoisier's researches included some of the first truly <a href="stoichiometry">quantitative chemical experiments</a>. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no <a href="gas">gas</a>es could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry. In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a>. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his "<a href="Trait%C3%A9%20%C3%89l%C3%A9mentaire%20de%20Chimie">Traité Élémentaire de Chimie</a>" to ""Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme."" (""Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.""). <a href="Mikhail%20Lomonosov">Mikhail Lomonosov</a> (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include <a href="Jean%20Rey%20%28physician%29">Jean Rey</a> (1583–1645), <a href="Joseph%20Black">Joseph Black</a> (1728–1799), and <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> (1731–1810). (See <a href="http%3A//www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp%3Fsearchtype%3Dkeyword%26amp%3BERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0%3DEJ128341%26amp%3BERICExtSearch_SearchType_0%3Dkw%26amp%3B_pageLabel%3DRecordDetails%26amp%3BobjectId%3D0900019b8005c793%26amp%3Baccno%3DEJ128341%26amp%3B_nfls%3Dfalse">An Historical Note on the Conservation of Mass</a>)

Lavoisier, together with <a href="Louis-Bernard%20Guyton%20de%20Morveau">Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau</a>, <a href="Claude-Louis%20Berthollet">Claude-Louis Berthollet</a>, and <a href="Antoine%20Fran%C3%A7ois%2C%20comte%20de%20Fourcroy">Antoine François de Fourcroy</a>, submitted a new program for the reforms of <a href="chemical%20nomenclature">chemical nomenclature</a> to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled "Méthode de nomenclature chimique" ("Method of Chemical Nomenclature", 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry. The <a href="Classical%20elements">Classical elements</a> of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; <a href="caloric%20theory">caloric</a> (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (<a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown "radicals" of muriatic acid (<a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>), <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a>, and "fluoric" acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as <a href="magnesium%20oxide">magnesia</a>, <a href="barite">barite</a>, and <a href="strontia">strontia</a>); three alkalies (<a href="potash">potash</a>, <a href="Sodium%20oxide">soda</a>, and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>); and the "radicals" of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the "ic" termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the "ous" ending. Similarly, salts of the "ic" acids were given the terminal letters "ate," as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the "ous" acids terminated with the suffix "ite," as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name "<a href="copper%20sulfate">copper sulfate</a>" with the old term "vitriol of Venus." Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.

Antoine Lavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the <a href="chemical%20revolution">chemical revolution</a>. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the wide spread acceptance of the <a href="Conservation%20of%20mass">law of conservation of mass</a>. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. However, Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>, <a href="Richard%20Kirwan">Richard Kirwan</a>, <a href="James%20Keir">James Keir</a>, and <a href="William%20Nicholson%20%28chemist%29">William Nicholson</a>, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass. Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Biot">Jean Baptiste Biot</a>, wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, "one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning." His opposition, however, that a precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasonings. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated: If it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the "exactitude scrupuleuse" of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs "de l'ordre demonstratif".

The "official" version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but "nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air" or the "eminently respirable part of the air". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning "acid former". He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.

Lavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his famous paper entitled "Réflexions sur le phlogistique" (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a> of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a>'s inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> for "water-former"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre Simon de Laplace</a>, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).

Despite these experiments, Lavoisier's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water, attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Meusnier">Jean-Baptiste Meusnier</a>, Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel, allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Académie des Sciences in April 1784, reporting his figures to eight decimal places. Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions, and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which utilized a pneumatic trough, a set of balances, a thermometer, and a barometer, all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus, convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier's theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment, however, proved subpar, as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was "more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition" of the composition of water and stated that the methods uses in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries. 

Lavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his "<a href="Trait%C3%A9%20%C3%A9l%C3%A9mentaire%20de%20chimie">Traité élémentaire de chimie</a>" ("Elementary Treatise on Chemistry"), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern <a href="textbook">textbook</a> on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a>, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for "Traité élémentaire" as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication. In any event, the "Traité élémentaire" was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.

The relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of <a href="Respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration physiology</a>. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782/1783 in association with <a href="Laplace">Laplace</a>. The result of this work was published in a famous memoir, "On Heat." Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice <a href="calorimeter">calorimeter</a> apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated, ""la respiration est donc une combustion,"" that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.

This continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with <a href="Armand%20Seguin">Armand Seguin</a>. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come.

Lavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the <a href="chemical%20balance">chemical balance</a>, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).

Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with <a href="Laplace">Laplace</a>. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.

Lavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that <a href="Radical%20%28chemistry%29">radicals</a>, which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of <a href="allotropy">allotropy in chemical elements</a> when he discovered that diamond is a <a href="allotropy">crystalline form of carbon</a>.

He was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer, an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these, he also created smaller, cheaper, more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.

He was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, expounding the true explanation of the results. He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.

Overall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.

Hermann Kolbe

Hermann Kolbe ("Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe", 27 September 1818 – 25 November 1884), was a seminal contributor in the birth of modern <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>. He was a Professor at <a href="University%20of%20Marburg">Marburg</a> and <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig</a>. Kolbe coined the term <a href="chemical%20synthesis">synthesis</a> and contributed to the philosophical demise of <a href="vitalism">vitalism</a> through synthesis of the <a href="organic%20chemical">organic substance</a> acetic acid from <a href="carbon%20disulfide">carbon disulfide</a>, and also contributed to the development of <a href="structural%20theory">structural theory</a>. This was done via modifications to the idea of "radicals" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his <a href="Kolbe%20electrolysis">Kolbe electrolysis</a> of carboxylate salts, the <a href="Kolbe-Schmitt%20reaction">Kolbe-Schmitt reaction</a> in the preparation of <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> and the <a href="Kolbe%20nitrile%20synthesis">Kolbe nitrile synthesis</a>. After studies with <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Wöhler</a> and <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Bunsen</a>, Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with <a href="Edward%20Frankland">Frankland</a>), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the . As such, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences won the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20London">Royal Society of London</a>'s Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training, by a storied next generation of chemists (including <a href="Aleksandr%20Mikhailovich%20Zaitsev">Zaitsev</a>, <a href="Theodor%20Curtius">Curtius</a>, <a href="Ernst%20Otto%20Beckmann">Beckmann</a>, <a href="Carl%20Graebe">Graebe</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Markovnikov">Markovnikov</a>, etc.), Kolbe is remembered for editing the "Journal" for more than a decade, where his rejection of <a href="August%20Kekul%C3%A9">Kekulé</a>'s structure of benzene, <a href="Jacobus%20Henricus%20van%20%27t%20Hoff">van't Hoff</a>'s theory on the origin of <a href="chirality">chirality</a> and <a href="Adolf%20von%20Baeyer">von Baeyer</a>'s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte. He was survived by four children.

Kolbe was born in Elliehausen, near <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Kingdom of Hanover</a> (Germany) as the eldest son of a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> pastor. At the age of 13, he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors. He obtained the leaving certificate (the <a href="Abitur">Abitur</a>) six years later. He had become passionate about the study of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, matriculating at the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a>.

In 1842, he became an assistant to <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Marburg">Philipps-Universität Marburg</a>. He took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university. A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to <a href="Lyon%20Playfair%2C%201st%20Baron%20Playfair">Lyon Playfair</a> at the new "Museum of Economic Geology" in London and a close friend of <a href="Edward%20Frankland">Edward Frankland</a>. From 1847, he was engaged in editing the "Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie" ("Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry") edited by <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>, <a href="W%C3%B6hler">Wöhler</a>, and <a href="Johann%20Christian%20Poggendorff">Johann Christian Poggendorff</a>, and he also wrote an important textbook. In 1851, Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg and, in 1865, he was called to the <a href="Leipzig%20University">Universität Leipzig</a>. In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>.

In 1853, he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage. They had four children.

As late as the 1840s, and despite <a href="W%C3%B6hler%20synthesis">Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea</a> in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of <a href="vitalism">vitalism</a>, according to which a special life-force was necessary to create "organic" (i.e., in its original meaning, biologically derived) compounds. Kolbe promoted the idea that <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this "organic" context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (Hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one <a href="organic%20compound">organic molecule</a> to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting "inorganic"—"anorganisch"—substances into "organic" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) He validated his theory by converting <a href="carbon%20disulfide">carbon disulfide</a> to <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> in several steps (1843–45). Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural <a href="radical%20theory">radicals</a>, so contributing to the development of <a href="structural%20theory">structural theory</a>. A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word <a href="chemical%20synthesis">synthesis</a> in its present-day meaning, and contributed a number of new chemical reactions.

In particular, Kolbe developed procedures for the <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of the salts of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty</a> and other <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s (<a href="Kolbe%20electrolysis">Kolbe electrolysis</a>) and prepared <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>, a building block of <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> in a process called <a href="Kolbe%20synthesis">Kolbe synthesis</a> or <a href="Kolbe-Schmitt%20reaction">Kolbe-Schmitt reaction</a>. His method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the <a href="Kolbe%20nitrile%20synthesis">Kolbe nitrile synthesis</a>,<a href="https%3A//books.google.ca/books%3Fid%3D4TBWg3dIyKQC%26amp%3Bpg%3DPA537%26amp%3Blpg%3DPA537%26amp%3Bdq%3Dkolbe%2Bnitrile%2Bsynthesis%2Bdetailed%2Bexplanation%26amp%3Bsource%3Dbl%26amp%3Bots%3DX-QZMe85H1%26amp%3Bsig%3DAGjsCA0YJpoFeDbODsJ0VosKjHc%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsa%3DX%26amp%3Bved%3D0ahUKEwje8bzSnprQAhVMzoMKHe1zBqAQ6AEILzAD%23v%3Donepage%26amp%3Bq%3Dkolbe%2520nitrile%25"></a> and with <a href="Edward%20Frankland">Edward Frankland</a> he found that <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a>s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids.
In addition to his own bench research and scholarly and editorial work, Kolbe oversaw student research at Leipzig and especially at Marburg; students spending time under his tutelage included <a href="Peter%20Griess">Peter Griess</a>, <a href="Aleksandr%20Mikhailovich%20Zaitsev">Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev</a> (known for <a href="Zaitsev%27s%20rule">Zaitsev's rule</a> predicting the product composition of elimination reactions), <a href="Theodor%20Curtius">Theodor Curtius</a> (discoverer of <a href="diazo">diazo</a> compounds, <a href="hydrazine">hydrazine</a>s, and the <a href="Curtius%20rearrangement">Curtius rearrangement</a>), <a href="Ernst%20Otto%20Beckmann">Ernst Otto Beckmann</a> (discoverer of the <a href="Beckmann%20rearrangement">Beckmann rearrangement</a>), <a href="Carl%20Graebe">Carl Graebe</a> (discoverer of <a href="alizarin">alizarin</a>), <a href="Oscar%20Loew">Oscar Loew</a>, <a href="Constantin%20Fahlberg">Constantin Fahlberg</a>, <a href="Nikolai%20Menshutkin">Nikolai Menshutkin</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Markovnikov">Vladimir Markovnikov</a> (first to describe <a href="carbocycle">carbocycle</a>s smaller and larger than <a href="cyclohexane">cyclohexane</a>, and known for <a href="Markovnikov%27s%20rule">Markovnikov's rule</a> describing addition reactions to alkenes), <a href="Jacob%20Volhard">Jacob Volhard</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20Mond">Ludwig Mond</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Crum%20Brown">Alexander Crum Brown</a> (first to describe the double bond of ethylene), <a href="Maxwell%20Simpson">Maxwell Simpson</a>, and <a href="Frederick%20Guthrie">Frederick Guthrie</a>.

Besides his work for <a href="periodical">periodical</a>s he wrote numerous books 
Kolbe served for more than a decade as what, in modern terms, would be understood the senior editor of the ("Journal of practical chemistry", from 1870 to 1884), Kolbe was sometimes so severely critical of the work of others, especially after about 1874, that some wondered whether he might have been suffering a mental illness. He was intolerant of what he regarded as loose speculation parading as theory, and sought through his writings to save his beloved science of chemistry from what he regarded as the scourge of modern structural theory.

His rejection of structural chemistry, especially the theories of the structure of benzene by <a href="August%20Kekul%C3%A9">August Kekulé</a>, the theory of the <a href="asymmetric%20carbon%20atom">asymmetric carbon atom</a> by <a href="Jacobus%20Henricus%20van%20%27t%20Hoff">J.H. van't Hoff</a>, and the reform of chemical nomenclature by <a href="Adolf%20von%20Baeyer">Adolf von Baeyer</a>, was expressed in his vituperative articles in the "Journal für Praktische Chemie". Some translated quotes illustrate his manner of articulating the deep conflict between his interpretation of chemistry and that of the structural chemists: 
"...Baeyer is an excellent experimentor, but he is only an empiricist, lacking sense and capability, and his interpretations of his experiments show particular deficiency in his familiarity with the principles of true science..."

The violence of his language worked unfairly to limit his posthumous reputation.

Amitabh Bachchan

Amitabh Harivansh Rai Shrivastava Bachchan (; born 11 October 1942) is an Indian film actor. He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for movies like "<a href="Zanjeer%20%281973%20film%29">Zanjeer</a>" and "<a href="Deewaar%20%281975%20film%29">Deewaar</a>", and was dubbed India's first "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a>. Referred to as the "<a href="Shahanshah">Shahenshah</a> of Bollywood", "Star of the Millennium" or "Big B",
he has since appeared in over 190 Indian films in a career spanning almost five decades. Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indian cinema</a>. So total was his dominance on the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> called him a "one-man industry."

Bachchan has won <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Amitabh%20Bachchan">numerous accolades</a> in his career, including four <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Awards</a> as <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. He has won fifteen <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a> and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 41 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a <a href="playback%20singer">playback singer</a>, film producer and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show, "<a href="Kaun%20Banega%20Crorepati">Kaun Banega Crorepati</a>", India's version of the game show franchise, "<a href="Who%20Wants%20to%20Be%20a%20Millionaire%3F">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a>". He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s.

The <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> honoured him with the <a href="Padma%20Shri">Padma Shri</a> in 1984, the <a href="Padma%20Bhushan">Padma Bhushan</a> in 2001 and the <a href="Padma%20Vibhushan">Padma Vibhushan</a> in 2015 for his contributions to <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>. The <a href="Government%20of%20France">Government of France</a> honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond.

Bachchan made his Hollywood debut in 2013 with "<a href="The%20Great%20Gatsby%20%282013%20film%29">The Great Gatsby</a>", in which he played a non-Indian Jewish character, Meyer Wolfsheim.

Bachchan was born in <a href="Allahabad">Allahabad</a>, Uttar Pradesh, in north central India. His ancestors on his father's side hailed from a village called <a href="Babupatti">Babupatti</a>, in the Raniganj tehsil, in the <a href="Pratapgarh%20district%2C%20Uttar%20Pradesh">Pratapgarh district</a>, in the present-day state of <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, in <a href="India">India</a>. His father <a href="Harivansh%20Rai%20Bachchan">Harivansh Rai Srivastava (Bachchan)</a> was a <a href="Srivastava">Srivastava</a> <a href="Kayastha">Kayastha</a> <a href="Awadhi%20people">Awadhi</a> <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> and a well-known <a href="Awadhi%20language">Awadhi dialect</a>-<a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> poet and his mother <a href="Teji%20Bachchan">Teji Bachchan</a> was a <a href="Khatri">Khatri</a>-<a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> <a href="Punjabis">Punjabi</a> <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> from Lyallpur (now <a href="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>), <a href="Punjab%20Province%20%28British%20India%29">Punjab</a>. Bachchan was initially named "Inquilaab," inspired by the phrase "<a href="Inquilab%20Zindabad">Inquilab Zindabad</a>" popularly used during the Indian independence struggle. In English, "Inquilab Zindabad" means "Long live the revolution." However, at the suggestion of fellow poet <a href="Sumitranandan%20Pant">Sumitranandan Pant</a>, Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which, according to a Times of India article, means "the light that will never die.". 
Although his surname was <a href="Srivastava">Shrivastava</a>, Amitabh's father had adopted the pen name Bachchan ("child-like" in colloquial Hindi), under which he published all of his works. It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, Bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family. Bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.

Bachchan is an alumnus of <a href="Sherwood%20College">Sherwood College</a>, <a href="Nainital">Nainital</a>. He later attended <a href="Kirori%20Mal%20College">Kirori Mal College</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Delhi">University of Delhi</a>. He has a younger brother, Ajitabh. His mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties. Teji had some influence in Amitabh Bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should "take the centre stage."

Bachchan is married to actress <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bhaduri</a>. The couple have two children, Shweta Bachchan (later after marriage, known as Shweta Nanda wife of businessman <a href="Nikhil%20Nanda">Nikhil Nanda</a>) and <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> (actor and husband of actress <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a>).

Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in <a href="Mrinal%20Sen">Mrinal Sen</a>'s <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film">National Award</a> winning film "<a href="Bhuvan%20Shome">Bhuvan Shome</a>". His first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film "<a href="Saat%20Hindustani">Saat Hindustani</a>" directed by <a href="Khwaja%20Ahmad%20Abbas">Khwaja Ahmad Abbas</a> and featuring <a href="Utpal%20Dutt">Utpal Dutt</a>, <a href="Anwar%20Ali%20%28actor%29">Anwar Ali</a> (brother of comedian <a href="Mehmood%20%28actor%29">Mehmood</a>), <a href="Madhu%20%28actor%29">Madhu</a> and <a href="Jalal%20Agha">Jalal Agha</a>.

"<a href="Anand%20%281971%20film%29">Anand</a>" (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside Rajesh Khanna. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare "<a href="List%20of%20awards%20for%20supporting%20actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>" award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in "<a href="Parwana%20%281971%20film%29">Parwana</a>" (1971). Following Parwana were several films including "<a href="Reshma%20Aur%20Shera">Reshma Aur Shera</a>" (1971). During this time, he made a guest appearance in the film "<a href="Guddi%20%281971%20film%29">Guddi</a>" which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri. He narrated part of the film "<a href="Bawarchi">Bawarchi</a>." In 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy "<a href="Bombay%20to%20Goa">Bombay to Goa</a>" directed by <a href="S.%20Ramanathan">S. Ramanathan</a>. Many of Bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change.

Director <a href="Prakash%20Mehra">Prakash Mehra</a> cast him in the leading role for the film "Zanjeer" (1973) as Inspector Vijay Khanna. The film was a sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it and established Amitabh in a new persona—the "angry young man" of Bollywood cinema. Filmfare considers this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history. The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star. From then onwards, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. He earned his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor for "Zanjeer". The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together; not only in "Zanjeer" but in films such as "<a href="Abhimaan%20%281973%20film%29">Abhimaan</a>" which followed and was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film "<a href="Namak%20Haraam">Namak Haraam</a>", a social drama directed by <a href="Hrishikesh%20Mukherjee">Hrishikesh Mukherjee</a> and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare "<a href="List%20of%20awards%20for%20supporting%20actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>" award.

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as "<a href="Kunwara%20Baap%20%281974%20film%29">Kunwara Baap</a>" and "<a href="Dost%20%281974%20film%29">Dost</a>", before playing a supporting role in "<a href="Roti%20Kapda%20Aur%20Makaan">Roti Kapda Aur Makaan</a>". The film, directed and written by <a href="Manoj%20Kumar">Manoj Kumar</a>, addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in the film "<a href="Majboor%20%281974%20film%29">Majboor</a>", released on 6 December 1974, which was a remake of the Hollywood film "<a href="Zig%20Zag%20%281970%20film%29">Zig Zag</a>". The film was a success at the box office. In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy "<a href="Chupke%20Chupke">Chupke Chupke</a>," the crime drama "<a href="Faraar">Faraar</a>" to the romantic drama "<a href="Mili%20%281975%20film%29">Mili</a>." 1975 was also the year when Bachchan appeared in two films regarded as important in Hindi cinema history. He starred in the <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a> directed film "Deewaar" along with <a href="Shashi%20Kapoor">Shashi Kapoor</a>, <a href="Nirupa%20Roy">Nirupa Roy</a>, and <a href="Neetu%20Singh">Neetu Singh</a>, earning him a Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number 4. "Indiatimes Movies" ranks "Deewaar" amongst the "Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films". Released on 15 August 1975 was "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>", which became the highest-grossing film of 1975 and also of all time in India, earning <a href="Indian%20rupee">INR</a> equivalent to US$60 million, after adjusting for inflation, in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev. Sholay is often credited with exalting Bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with Zanjeer and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 70s and 80s. In 1999, <a href="BBC">BBC</a> India declared it the "Film of the Millennium" and like "Deewar", it has been cited by "<a href="Indiatimes">Indiatimes</a> movies" as amongst the "Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films". In that same year, the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years.

In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama "<a href="Kabhie%20Kabhie%20%281976%20film%29">Kabhie Kabhie</a>". Bachchan starred as a young poet named Amit Malhotra who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja (<a href="Rakhee%20Gulzar">Rakhee Gulzar</a>) who ends up marrying someone else (<a href="Shashi%20Kapoor">Shashi Kapoor</a>). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his "angry young man" roles like "Zanjeer" and "Deewar". The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in "<a href="Adalat%20%281976%20film%29">Adalat</a>" as father and son. In 1977, he won his first <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Filmfare Best Actor Award</a> for his performance in "Amar Akbar Anthony" where he played the third lead opposite <a href="Vinod%20Khanna">Vinod Khanna</a> and <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a> as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include "<a href="Parvarish%20%281977%20film%29">Parvarish</a>" and "<a href="Khoon%20Pasina">Khoon Pasina</a>". He once again resumed double roles in films such as "<a href="Kasme%20Vaade">Kasme Vaade</a>" (1978) as Amit and Shankar and "<a href="Don%20%281978%20film%29">Don</a>" (1978) playing the characters of Don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's "<a href="Trishul%20%28film%29">Trishul</a>" and Prakash Mehra's "<a href="Muqaddar%20Ka%20Sikandar">Muqaddar Ka Sikandar</a>" both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is widely regarded as perhaps his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Trishul, Don, Kasme Vaade, "<a href="Ganga%20Ki%20Saugandh">Ganga Ki Saugandh</a>" and "<a href="Besharam">Besharam</a>" were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.
In 1979, Bachchan starred in "<a href="Suhaag%20%281979%20film%29">Suhaag</a>" which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like "<a href="Mr.%20Natwarlal">Mr. Natwarlal</a>," "<a href="Kaala%20Patthar">Kaala Patthar</a>", "<a href="The%20Great%20Gambler">The Great Gambler</a>" and "<a href="Manzil%20%281979%20film%29">Manzil</a>". Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film "Mr. Natwarlal" in which he starred with <a href="Rekha">Rekha</a>. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the "<a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Playback%20Singer">Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer</a>". He also received Best Actor nomination for "Kaala Patthar" and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the <a href="Raj%20Khosla">Raj Khosla</a> directed film "<a href="Dostana%20%281980%20film%29">Dostana</a>", in which he starred opposite <a href="Shatrughan%20Sinha">Shatrughan Sinha</a> and <a href="Zeenat%20Aman">Zeenat Aman</a>. "Dostana" proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980. In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film "<a href="Silsila%20%28film%29">Silsila</a>", where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha. Other films of this period like "<a href="Shaan%20%28film%29">Shaan</a>" (1980) and "<a href="Shakti%20%281982%20film%29">Shakti</a>" (1982) which pitted him against the veteran actor <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a> were not successful at the box office but "<a href="Ram%20Balram">Ram Balram</a>" (1980), "<a href="Naseeb%20%281981%20film%29">Naseeb</a>" (1981) and "<a href="Laawaris%20%28film%29">Lawaaris</a>" (1981) were successful.

In 1982 he played double roles in the films "<a href="Satte%20Pe%20Satta">Satte Pe Satta</a>" and "<a href="Desh%20Premee">Desh Premee</a>" which succeeded at the box office. In 1983 he played a triple role in "<a href="Mahaan">Mahaan</a>" and starred in the top-grossing film of that year "<a href="Coolie">Coolie</a>".

On 26 July 1982, while filming "<a href="Coolie%20%281983%20Hindi%20film%29">Coolie</a>", in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor <a href="Puneet%20Issar">Puneet Issar</a>. Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a <a href="Splenic%20injury">splenic rupture</a> from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency <a href="splenectomy">splenectomy</a> and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.

Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year.

The director, <a href="Manmohan%20Desai">Manmohan Desai</a>, altered the ending of "Coolie" after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.

Later, he was diagnosed with <a href="Myasthenia%20gravis">Myasthenia gravis</a>. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received and stated before every release, "Yeh film to flop hogi!" ("This film will flop").

In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, <a href="Rajiv%20Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a>. He contested Allahabad's seat of <a href="8th%20Lok%20Sabha">8th Lok Sabha</a> against <a href="Hemvati%20Nandan%20Bahuguna">H. N. Bahuguna</a>, former <a href="List%20of%20Chief%20Ministers%20of%20Uttar%20Pradesh">Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh</a> and won by one of the highest victory margins in <a href="General%20elections%20in%20India">general election history</a> (68.2% of the vote). His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a <a href="Cesspit">cesspool</a>. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the "<a href="Bofors%20scandal">Bofors scandal</a>" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal.

His old friend, <a href="Amar%20Singh%20%28politician%29">Amar Singh</a>, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan%20Corporation">ABCL</a>. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the <a href="Samajwadi%20Party">Samajwadi Party</a>, the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi party and represented the party as an MP in the <a href="Rajya%20Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a>. Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.

A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by "<a href="Stardust%20%28magazine%29">Stardust</a>" and some of the other film magazines. In defence, Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.

In 1988, Bachchan returned to films, playing the title role in "<a href="Shahenshah%20%28film%29">Shahenshah</a>", which was a box office success. After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like "<a href="Jaadugar">Jaadugar</a>", "<a href="Toofan%20%281989%20film%29">Toofan</a>" and "<a href="Main%20Azaad%20Hoon">Main Azaad Hoon</a>" (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film, "<a href="Hum%20%28film%29">Hum</a>", for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like it might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">National Film Award for Best Actor</a> for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 film "<a href="Agneepath%20%281990%20film%29">Agneepath</a>." These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of "<a href="Khuda%20Gawah">Khuda Gawah</a>" in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of "<a href="Insaniyat%20%281994%20film%29">Insaniyat</a>" (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.

Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan%20Corporation">Amitabh Bachchan Corporation</a>, Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996, with a vision of becoming a 10 billion rupees (approx. U.S. $250 M) premier entertainment company by the year 2000. ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry. ABCL's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management. Soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was "<a href="Tere%20Mere%20Sapne%20%281996%20film%29">Tere Mere Sapne</a>," which did not fare well at the box office but launched the careers of actors like <a href="Arshad%20Warsi">Arshad Warsi</a> and southern film star <a href="Simran%20%28actress%29">Simran</a>. ABCL produced a few other films, none of which did well.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film "<a href="Mrityudata">Mrityudata</a>", produced by ABCL. Though "Mrityudaata" attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically. ABCL was the main sponsor of the "<a href="Miss%20World%201996">1996 Miss World beauty pageant</a>", <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board. The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay <a href="bungalow">bungalow</a> 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of <a href="Canara%20Bank">Canara Bank</a> were disposed of. Bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career and had average success with "<a href="Bade%20Miyan%20Chote%20Miyan">Bade Miyan Chote Miyan</a>" (1998), and received positive reviews for "<a href="Sooryavansham">Sooryavansham</a>" (1999) but other films such as "<a href="Lal%20Baadshah">Lal Baadshah</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Hindustan%20Ki%20Kasam%20%281999%20film%29">Hindustan Ki Kasam</a>" (1999) were box office failures.

In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, "<a href="Mohabbatein">Mohabbatein</a>", directed by <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a>. He played a stern, older figure that rivalled the character of <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shahrukh Khan</a>. His role won him his third <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award</a>. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in "" (2001), "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (2001) and "<a href="Baghban%20%28film%29">Baghban</a>" (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in "<a href="Aks%20%28film%29">Aks</a>" (2001), "<a href="Aankhen%20%282002%20film%29">Aankhen</a>" (2002), "<a href="Khakee">Khakee</a>" (2004) and "<a href="Dev%20%28film%29">Dev</a>" (2004).
His performance in "Aks" won him his first <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor</a>.
One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>'s "<a href="Black%20%282005%20film%29">Black</a>" (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films "<a href="Bunty%20Aur%20Babli">Bunty Aur Babli</a>" (2005), the "<a href="The%20Godfather">Godfather</a>" tribute "<a href="Sarkar%20%28film%29">Sarkar</a>" (2005), and "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006). All of them were successful at the box office. His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were "<a href="Baabul%20%282006%20film%29">Baabul</a>" (2006), "<a href="Ekalavya">Ekalavya</a>" and "<a href="Nishabd">Nishabd</a>" (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.

In May 2007, two of his films "<a href="Cheeni%20Kum">Cheeni Kum</a>" and the multi-starrer "<a href="Shootout%20at%20Lokhandwala">Shootout at Lokhandwala</a>" were released. "Shootout at Lokhandwala" did well at the box office and was declared a semi-hit in India, while "Cheeni Kum" picked up after a slow start and only had average success. A remake of his biggest hit, "Sholay" (1975), entitled "<a href="Aag%20%282007%20film%29">Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag</a>", released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception. The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, <a href="Rituparno%20Ghosh">Rituparno Ghosh</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Lear">The Last Lear</a>", co-starring <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a> and <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a>. The film premiered at the <a href="2007%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2007 Toronto International Film Festival</a> on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since "Black".
Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, "<a href="Shantaram%20%28film%29">Shantaram</a>", directed by <a href="Mira%20Nair">Mira Nair</a> and starring Hollywood actor <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008. The film is currently "shelved" indefinitely. <a href="Vivek%20Sharma">Vivek Sharma</a>'s "<a href="Bhoothnath">Bhoothnath</a>", in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. "<a href="Sarkar%20Raj">Sarkar Raj</a>", the sequel of the 2005 film "Sarkar", released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box-office. "<a href="Paa%20%28film%29">Paa</a>", which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance. It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award. In 2010, he debuted in <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam film</a> through "<a href="Kandahar%20%282010%20film%29">Kandahar</a>", directed by <a href="Major%20Ravi">Major Ravi</a> and co-starring <a href="Mohanlal">Mohanlal</a>. The film was based on the hijacking incident of the <a href="Indian%20Airlines%20Flight%20814">Indian Airlines Flight 814</a>. Bachchan declined any remuneration for this film. In 2013 he made his Hollywood debut in "<a href="The%20Great%20Gatsby%20%282013%20film%29">The Great Gatsby</a>" making a special appearance opposite <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href="Tobey%20Maguire">Tobey Maguire</a>. In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel "<a href="Bhoothnath%20Returns">Bhoothnath Returns</a>". The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father suffering from chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed "<a href="Piku">Piku</a>" which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015. A review in "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" (DNA) summarized Bachchan's performance as "The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements. His performance in Piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" summed up, "Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up." The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Bachchan will next appear in <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Varma">Ram Gopal Varma</a>'s "<a href="Sarkar%203">Sarkar 3</a>".

For example, in <a href="English%20language">English</a>, a past tense morpheme is "-ed". It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a <a href="schwa">schwa</a> when following an alveolar stop:


Notice the "other than" restrictions above. This is a common fact about allomorphy: if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, then the first matching case usually "wins". Thus, the above conditions could be re-written as follows:


The fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final , despite the fact that the latter is voiceless, is then explained by the fact that appears in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered. Likewise, the fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final is because the earlier clause for the allomorph takes priority; and the fact that the allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phonemes is because the preceding clause for the takes priority.

Irregular past tense forms, such as "broke" or "was/ were", can be seen as still more specific cases (since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb "break"), which therefore take priority over the general cases listed above.

Allomorphy can also exist in stems or <a href="Root%20%28linguistics%29">roots</a>, as in <a href="Classical%20Sanskrit">Classical Sanskrit</a>:

There are three allomorphs of the stem: , and . The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes.

The form of the stem , found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of <a href="velars">velars</a> resulted in the variant form , which was initially phonologically conditioned. The conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form for which the is followed by the high front vowel .

However, subsequent merging of and into made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case (both singular and plural) as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular. Thus, allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes.

Phonological conditioning also accounts for the form in the instrumental plural in which the assimilates in voicing to the following .

The term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure. It was first applied to language (in writing) in 1948, by Fatih Şat and Sibel Merve in Language XXIV.

Allophone

In <a href="phonology">phonology</a>, an allophone (; from the , "állos", "other" and φωνή, "phōnē", "voice, sound") is one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds (or "<a href="Phone%20%28phonetics%29">phones</a>") or signs used to pronounce a single <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> in a particular language. For example, <a href="Aspirated%20consonant"></a> (as in "pin") and (as in "spin") are allophones for the phoneme in the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>. The specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable from the phonetic context (such allophones are called positional variants), but sometimes allophones occur in <a href="free%20variation">free variation</a>. Replacing a sound by another allophone of the same phoneme will usually not change the meaning of a word, although sometimes the result may sound non-native or even unintelligible. Native speakers of a given language usually perceive one phoneme in that language as a single distinctive sound, and are ""both unaware of and even shocked by"" the allophone variations used to pronounce single phonemes.

The term "allophone" was coined by <a href="Benjamin%20Lee%20Whorf">Benjamin Lee Whorf</a> in the 1940s. In doing so, he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and <a href="Bernard%20Bloch%20%28linguist%29">Bernard Bloch</a> in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition.

Every time a user's speech is vocalized for a given phoneme, it will be slightly different from other utterances, even for the same speaker. This has led to some debate over how real, and how universal, phonemes really are (see <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> for details). Only some of the variation is significant (i.e., detectable or perceivable) to speakers. There are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation, or whether the speaker has freedom to (unconsciously) choose which allophone to use.

When a specific allophone (from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme) "must" be selected in a given context (i.e., using a different allophone for a phoneme will cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native), the allophones are said to be 'complementary' (i.e., the allophones complement each other, and one is not used in a situation where the usage of another is standard). In the case of complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a <a href="phonology">phonological</a> process.

In other cases, the speaker is able to select freely from <a href="free%20variation">free variant</a> allophones, based on personal habit or preference.

Another example of an allophone is <a href="assimilation%20%28phonology%29">assimilation</a>, wherein a phoneme is to sound more like the other phoneme. One example of assimilation is <a href="consonant%20voicing%20and%20devoicing">consonant voicing and devoicing</a>, wherein voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.

A <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tonic</a> allophone is sometimes called an allotone, for example in the neutral tone of <a href="Standard%20Mandarin">Mandarin</a>.

There are many allophonic processes in English, like lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.


Because the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control, people may not realize they exist. English speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme , namely unreleased as in "cat", aspirated as in "top", glottalized as in "button", flapped as in American English "water", nasalized flapped as in "winter", and none of the above as in "stop". However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:


If a flame is held before the lips while these words are spoken, it flickers more during aspirated "nitrate" than during unaspirated "night rate." The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a Mandarin speaker, to whom and are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than it is to the English speaker who has learned since childhood to ignore it.

Allophones of English may be noticed if the 'light' of "leaf" is contrasted with the 'dark' of "feel" . Again, this difference is much more obvious to a Turkish speaker, for whom and are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.

There are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation. (See e.g. <a href="Hawaiian%20language%23Consonants">Hawaiian</a> and <a href="Toki%20Pona%23Allophony">Toki Pona</a>.) Examples: (Links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon.)

Since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct <a href="phonetic%20transcription">phonetic transcription</a>. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple "<a href="broad%20transcription">broad transcription</a>" is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, so that the allophony is significant, things become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, then that representation is chosen for the phoneme.

However, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than this allows. In such cases a common convention is to use the "elsewhere condition" to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme. The "elsewhere" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules. For example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable; elsewhere they are oral. Therefore, by the "elsewhere" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic; nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.

In other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the world's languages than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory. Another alternative, commonly employed for <a href="archiphoneme">archiphoneme</a>s, is the use of a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [ŋ].

In rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as <a href="dingbat">dingbat</a>s, so as not to privilege any one allophone.

Affix

An affix (in modern sense) is a <a href="morpheme">morpheme</a> that is attached to a word <a href="stem%20%28linguistics%29">stem</a> to form a new word or word form. Affixes may be <a href="Morphological%20derivation">derivational</a>, like English "-ness" and "pre-", or <a href="inflection">inflection</a>al, like English plural "-s" and past tense "-ed". They are <a href="bound%20morpheme">bound morpheme</a>s by definition; <a href="prefix">prefix</a>es and <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es may be <a href="separable%20affix">separable affix</a>es. Affixations, the linguistic process speakers use form different words by adding morphemes (affixes) at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.

Affixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. "Prefix" and "suffix" are extremely common terms. "Infix" and "circumfix" are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.

"Prefix" and "suffix" may be subsumed under the term "adfix" in contrast to "infix."

When marking text for <a href="interlinear%20gloss">interlinear gloss</a>ing, as in the third column in the chart above. simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.

"Lexical affixes" (or "semantic affixes") are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as <a href="incorporated%20noun">incorporated noun</a>s within verbs and as elements of <a href="noun">noun</a>s. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.

Lexical affixes are relatively rare. The <a href="Wakashan%20languages">Wakashan</a>, <a href="Salishan%20languages">Salishan</a>, and <a href="Chimakuan%20languages">Chimakuan languages</a> all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an <a href="areal%20feature">areal feature</a> of the Pacific Northwest of the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>.

The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of <a href="Saanich%20language">Northern Straits Saanich</a> written in the Saanich orthography and in <a href="Americanist%20phonetic%20notation">Americanist notation</a>:

Lexical suffixes, when compared with free nouns, often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such "saltwater", "whitewater", etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become <a href="grammaticalization">grammaticalized</a> to various degrees.

Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic <a href="Verb%20argument">arguments</a> just as free nouns are and, thus, equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the <a href="Halkomelem%20language">Halkomelem language</a> (the <a href="word%20order">word order</a> here is <a href="verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object">verb–subject–object</a>):

In sentence (1), the verb "wash" is šak’ʷətəs where šak’ʷ- is the root and -ət and -əs are inflectional suffixes. The subject "the woman" is łə słeniʔ and the object "the baby" is łə qeq. In this sentence, "the baby" is a free noun. (The niʔ here is an <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary</a>, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)

In sentence (2), "baby" does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -əyəł which is affixed to the verb root šk’ʷ- (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix is neither "the baby" (<a href="definiteness">definite</a>) nor "a baby" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.

In <a href="orthography">orthography</a>, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, <a href="Maya%20script">Maya glyphs</a> are generally compounds of a "main sign" and smaller "affixes" joined at its margins. These are called "prefixes, superfixes, postfixes," and "subfixes" according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an "infix." Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the <a href="Indic%20alphabets">Indic alphabets</a>. For example, the <a href="Tibetan%20alphabet">Tibetan alphabet</a> utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.

Allegory

As a <a href="literary%20device">literary device</a>, an allegory is a <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> whose vehicle may be a character, place or event, representing real-world issues and occurrences. Allegory (in the sense of the practice and use of allegorical devices and works) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of <a href="art">art</a>, largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.

Writers or speakers typically use allegories as <a href="literary%20device">literary device</a>s or as <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>al devices that convey (semi-)hidden meanings through <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.

First attested in English in 1382, the word "allegory" comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "allegoria", the <a href="latinisation%20%28literature%29">latinisation</a> of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἀλληγορία ("allegoría"), "veiled language, figurative," which in turn comes from both ἄλλος ("allos"), "another, different" and ἀγορεύω ("agoreuo"), "to harangue, to speak in the assembly" which originate from ἀγορά ("agora"), "assembly".

<a href="Northrop%20Frye">Northrop Frye</a> discussed what he termed a "continuum of allegory", a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the "naive allegory" of "<a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">The Faerie Queene</a>", to the more private allegories of modern <a href="paradox%20%28literature%29">paradox literature</a>. In this perspective, the characters in a "naive" allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the allegory has been selected first, and the details merely flesh it out.

Many ancient religions are based on <a href="astrological%20allegory">astrological allegories</a>, that is, allegories of the movement of the sun and the moon as seen from the Earth.

In classical literature two of the best-known allegories are <a href="Allegory%20of%20the%20Cave">the Cave</a> in Plato's "<a href="Republic">Republic</a>" (pageRank.Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa (<a href="Livy">Livy</a> ii. 32). Among the best-known examples of allegory, <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s <a href="Allegory%20of%20the%20Cave">Allegory of the Cave</a>, forms a part of his larger work "<a href="The%20Republic%20%28Plato%29">The Republic</a>." In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a–b). The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows, using language to identify their world (514c–515a). According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality, until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows. He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e–518a). This allegory is, on a basic level, about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding, seeks to share it as is his duty, and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough.
In Late Antiquity <a href="Martianus%20Capella">Martianus Capella</a> organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and "Philologia," with the seven <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> the young man needed to know as guests.

Other early allegories are found in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, such as the extended metaphor in <a href="Psalm%2080">Psalm 80</a> of the <a href="Grapevine">Vine</a> and its impressive spread and growth, representing Israel's conquest and peopling of the Promised Land. Also allegorical is <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> 16 and 17, wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty Eagle represents Israel's exile to Rome.

Allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story, while infusing it with a spiritual context. Mediaeval thinking accepted allegory as having a "reality" underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull "<a href="Unam%20Sanctam">Unam Sanctam</a>" (1302) presents themes of the unity of <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a> with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: ""Therefore" of this one and only Church there is one body and one head—not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they "necessarily" confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ." This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.

In the late 15th century, the enigmatic "<a href="Hypnerotomachia">Hypnerotomachia</a>", with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and <a href="masque">masque</a>s on contemporary allegorical representation, as <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist dialectic</a> conveyed them.

The denial of medieval allegory as found in the 11th-century works of <a href="Hugh%20of%20St%20Victor">Hugh of St Victor</a> and <a href="Edward%20Topsell">Edward Topsell</a>'s "Historie of Foure-footed Beastes" (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a> and the astronomer <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a> is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.

Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognised. This is allegoresis, or the act of reading a story as an allegory. Examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>, and even some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>" by <a href="C.S.%20Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> and "<a href="Mark%20Helprin%23Works">A Kingdom Far and Clear: The Complete Swan Lake Trilogy</a>" by <a href="Mark%20Helprin">Mark Helprin</a>.

The story of the apple falling onto <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s head is another famous allegory. It simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered. It also made the scientific revelation well known by condensing the theory into a short tale.

It is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work, not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical, and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way. According to Henry Littlefield's 1964 article, <a href="L.%20Frank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>", may be readily understood as a plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters, intended to discuss the politics of the time. Yet, <a href="George%20MacDonald">George MacDonald</a> emphasised in 1893 that, "A fairy tale is not an allegory," in direct reference to "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>".

<a href="J.R.R.%20Tolkien">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" is another example of a well-known work mistakenly perceived as allegorical, as the author himself once stated, "...I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author." While this does not mean his works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.

Like allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings – a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning.

Some unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works:

Allotropy

Allotropy or allotropism () is the property of some <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical <a href="State%20of%20matter">state</a>, known as "allotropes" of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element; the <a href="atom">atom</a>s of the element are <a href="chemical%20bond">bonded</a> together in a different manner. For example, the <a href="allotropes%20of%20carbon">allotropes of carbon</a> include <a href="diamond">diamond</a> (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a <a href="tetrahedral">tetrahedral</a> lattice arrangement), <a href="graphite">graphite</a> (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a <a href="hexagonal%20lattice">hexagonal lattice</a>), <a href="graphene">graphene</a> (single sheets of graphite), and <a href="fullerene">fullerene</a>s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term "allotropy" is used for elements only, not for <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a>. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is <a href="Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29">polymorphism</a>. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same <a href="state%20of%20matter">phase</a> (i.e. different <a href="solid">solid</a>, <a href="liquid">liquid</a> or <a href="gas">gas</a> forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered to be examples of allotropy.

For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases – for example, two <a href="allotropes%20of%20oxygen">allotropes of oxygen</a> (<a href="oxygen">dioxygen</a>, O, and <a href="ozone">ozone</a>, O), can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases – for example <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> has <a href="allotropes%20of%20phosphorus">numerous solid allotropes</a>, which all revert to the same P form when melted to the liquid state.

The concepts of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jakob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jakob Berzelius</a> (1779–1848). The term is derived . After the acceptance of <a href="Avogadro%27s%20law">Avogadro's hypothesis</a> in 1860 it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and the two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O and O. In the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.

By 1912, <a href="Wilhelm%20Ostwald">Ostwald</a> noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of <a href="Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29">polymorphism</a> known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism. Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, <a href="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.

Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e. <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, <a href="photochemistry">light</a>, and <a href="temperature">temperature</a>. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, <a href="iron">iron</a> changes from a <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> structure <a href="Ferrite%20%28iron%29">(ferrite)</a> to a <a href="face-centered%20cubic">face-centered cubic</a> structure (<a href="austenite">austenite</a>) above 906 °C, and <a href="tin">tin</a> undergoes a modification known as <a href="tin%20pest">tin pest</a> from a <a href="metal">metal</a>lic form to a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O).

Typically, elements capable of variable <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a> and/or <a href="oxidation%20states">oxidation states</a> tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to <a href="catenation">catenate</a>.

Examples of allotropes include:

Among the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities (56 up to U, without Tc and Pm), almost half (27) are allotropic at ambient pressure: Li, Be, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Sr, Y, Zr, Sn, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Yb, Hf, Tl, Th, Pa and U. Some <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a>s between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of Ti at 882 °C, Fe at 912 °C and 1394 °C, Co at 422 °C, Zr at 863 °C, Sn at 13 °C and U at 668 °C and 776 °C.

Agathocles of Syracuse

Agathocles (, "Agathoklḗs"; 361–289 BC) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="tyrant">tyrant</a> of <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> (317–289 BC) and king of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> (304–289 BC).

Agathocles was born at Thermae <a href="Himera">Himera</a>eae (modern name <a href="Termini%20Imerese">Termini Imerese</a>) in Sicily. The son of a <a href="pottery">potter</a> who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother <a href="Antander">Antander</a>. In 333 BC he married the <a href="widow">widow</a> of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice <a href="Exile">banished</a> for attempting to overthrow the <a href="oligarchy">oligarchical</a> party in Syracuse.

In 317 BC he returned with an army of <a href="mercenary">mercenaries</a> under a solemn oath to observe the <a href="democracy">democratic</a> <a href="constitution">constitution</a> which was established after they took the city. Having banished or murdered some 10,000 citizens, and thus made himself master of Syracuse, he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.

War with <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Himera%20River%20%28311%20BC%29">Battle of the Himera River</a> and <a href="siege">besieged</a> in Syracuse. In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the <a href="blockade">blockade</a> and attack the enemy in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. In Africa he concluded the treaty with <a href="Ophellas">Ophellas</a>, ruler of <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>. After several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily.

After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the <a href="Halycus">Halycus River</a>. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.

His last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson <a href="Archagathus%20%28grandson%20of%20Agathocles%20of%20Syracuse%29">Archagathus</a>, at whose instigation he is said to have been <a href="poison">poison</a>ed; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular "tyrant." Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.

Agathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons: <a href="Archagathus%20%28son%20of%20Agathocles%20of%20Syracuse%29">Archagathus</a> and Agathocles, who were both murdered in 307 BC. His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called <a href="Lanassa%20%28wife%20of%20Pyrrhus%29">Lanassa</a>, who married as the second wife of King <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a>. His third wife was the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Greek Ptolemaic Princess</a> <a href="Theoxena%20of%20Syracuse">Theoxena</a>, who was the second daughter of <a href="Berenice%20I%20of%20Egypt">Berenice I</a> from her first husband <a href="Philip%20%28first%20husband%20of%20Berenice%20I%20of%20Egypt%29">Philip</a> and was a stepdaughter of <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy I Soter</a>. Theoxena bore Agathocles two children: <a href="Archagathus%20of%20Libya">Archagathus</a> and <a href="Theoxena%20of%20Egypt">Theoxena</a>. Theoxena survived Agathocles. He had further descendants from his second and third marriage.

Agathocles was cited as an example "Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes” in Chapter VIII of <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>’s treatise on politics - "<a href="The%20Prince">The Prince</a>" (1513). 
He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. Machiavelli claimed: 

Machiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that 

However, he came to "glory" as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land.

Economy of Alberta

From 1990 to 2003, Alberta's economy grew by 57% compared to 43% for all of Canada—the strongest economic growth of any region in Canada. In 2006 Alberta's per capita GDP was <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20GDP%20per%20capita%20%28nominal%29">higher than all US states</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20country%20subdivisions%20by%20GDP%20per%20capita%20%28nominal%29">one of the highest figures in the world</a>. In 2006, the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history. Alberta's per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>74,825 (approx. US$75,000). Alberta's per capita GDP in 2007 was 61% higher than the Canadian average of <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>46,441 and more than twice that of all the <a href="Maritime%20provinces">Maritime provinces</a>. From 2004 to 2014 Alberta's "exports of commodities rose 91%, reaching $121 billion in 2014" and 500,000 new jobs were created. In 2014, Alberta’s real GDP by expenditure grew by 4.8%, the strongest growth rate among the provinces."

Beginning in June 2014 the record high volume of worldwide oil inventories in storage—referred to as a global <a href="2010s%20oil%20glut">oil glut</a>—caused crude oil prices to collapse at near ten-year low prices. By 2016 <a href="West%20Texas%20Intermediate">West Texas Intermediate</a> (WTI)—the benchmark light, sweet crude oil—reached its lowest price in ten years—US$26.55. In 2012 the price of WTI had reached US$125 and in 2014 the price was $100. By February 2016 the price of <a href="Western%20Canadian%20Select">Western Canadian Select</a> WCS—the Alberta benchmark heavy crude oil—was US$14.10—the cheapest oil in the world. Alberta's economy suffered with over 100,000 oil patch jobs lost. In spite of the surplus with the low price of WCS in 2015—99% of Canada's oil exports went to the United States and in 2015 Canada was still their largest exporter of total petroleum—3,789 thousand bpd in September, 3,401 thousand bpd in October up from 3,026 thousand bpd in September 2014.

Each fiscal quarter the office of Alberta Treasury Board and Finance submits a report which includes an updated Alberta economic outlook and predictions for the following year.

In the third quarterly fiscal update published in February 2016, forecasts for the Crown debt was $18.9 billion compared to a surplus of $1.12 billion in 2014/2015. The deficit was forecast at $6.3 billion, revenue was forecast to be $43.1 billion and the expense was forecast at $49.4 billion. The 2015/2016 forecast for non-renewable resource revenue has been decreased to $2.47, down from In 2014-15 the non-renewable resource revenue was $8.95 billion. In the 2015 spring budget it was projected to be $2.77 billion. With the lower exchange rate crude oil royalties—budgeted at $610 million are forecast to be $74 million higher but remain much lower than the $2.25 billion in 2014-15. Transfers from the federal government are forecast at a total of 7,256 million up from 5,982 in 2014-15. If global oil production continued to outperform expectations for an even more prolonged period, Alberta's outlook will be further weakened. In January 2016 the price of <a href="Western%20Canadian%20Select">Western Canadian Select</a> WCS—the Alberta heavy oil benchmark—fell below US$20 per barrel—"the lowest level since trading began in 2004." However, Alberta's economy experienced real GDP growth because of an improved trade balance with declining imports and rising exports—mainly because of the low Canadian dollar. The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.

On August 30, 2015, <a href="Joe%20Ceci">Joe Ceci</a> Minister of Finance of Alberta, released the quarterly fiscal update which covers the period from April 1 to June 30, stating that the Alberta budget "could include a deficit of as much as $6.5-billion (Canadian) – $1.1-billion more than his previous estimate – if the oil industry downturn persists at recent levels." Rachel Notley’s NDP party came into power on May 24, 2015.

Factors such as the lower Canadian-US exchange rate and the lower <a href="Western%20Canadian%20Select">WTI-WCS</a> price differential bolstered the otherwise downgraded outlook. The dramatic drop in the <a href="price%20of%20oil">price of oil</a>, weakened Alberta's economic outlook and continued to contribute to the province's loss of revenue. Alberta's oil and gas investment is "expected to fall over 30% in 2015, with weakness carrying into 2016." From January through July oil rig activity declined almost 50%. By July 2015 the unemployment rate was 6.0%. In spite of the rising unemployment rate, and the outflow of some Albertans due to job loss, 7,723 people from outside Alberta moved there from January to April, leaving a positive net flow with a forecast population growth of 2% in 2015.

Alberta has a small internal market, and it is relatively distant from major <a href="World%20economy">world market</a>s, despite good <a href="transportation%20in%20Canada">transportation links to the rest of Canada</a> and <a href="transportation%20in%20the%20United%20States">to the United States to the south</a>. Alberta is located in the <a href="Geography%20of%20North%20America">northwestern quadrant</a> of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, in a region of low <a href="population%20density">population density</a> called the <a href="Interior%20Plains">Interior Plains</a>. Alberta is <a href="landlocked">landlocked</a>, and separated by <a href="Western%20Cordillera%20%28North%20America%29">a series of mountain ranges</a> from the nearest <a href="List%20of%20North%20American%20ports%23Canada%205">outlets</a> to the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">Pacific Ocean</a>, and by the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> from ports on <a href="Thunder%20Bay">the Lakehead</a> or <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the <a href="Northeast%20megalopolis">Boston – Washington</a>, <a href="California%20megapolitan%20areas">San Francisco - San Diego</a>, <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Megalopolis">Chicago – Pittsburgh</a>, and <a href="Quebec%20City%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Windsor%20Corridor">Quebec City – Windsor Corridor</a>s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started <a href="industrialization">industrialization</a> in other places (notably the original <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in Great Britain) but which require large <a href="labour%20force">labour force</a>s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely <a href="Textile%20manufacturing">textiles</a>, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, or transportation-related manufacturing (<a href="automotive%20manufacturing">automotives</a>, <a href="ship%20building">ships</a>, or <a href="List%20of%20locomotive%20builders">train cars</a>).

<a href="Agriculture%20in%20Canada">Agriculture</a> has the been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, <a href="temperate">temperate</a>, and <a href="continental%20climate">continental</a>, with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the <a href="Peace%20River%20country">Peace River country</a> above the <a href="55th%20parallel%20north">55th parallel north</a>. Generally, however, <a href="northern%20Alberta">northern Alberta</a> (and areas along the <a href="Alberta%20Rockies">Alberta Rockies</a>) is forested land and <a href="logging">logging</a> is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily <a href="field%20crops">field crops</a> in the east, <a href="livestock">livestock</a> in the west, and a mixture in between and in the <a href="Aspen%20parkland">parkland belt</a> in the near north.

Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a> (the <a href="Athabasca%20Oil%20Sands">Athabasca Oil Sands</a>).

Because of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on <a href="transportation%20in%20Alberta">transportation links</a> with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new <a href="transportation%20infrastructure">transportation infrastructure</a>, (see "trends" below). Alberta is now served by two major <a href="transcontinental%20railways">transcontinental railways</a> (<a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">CN</a> and <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">CP</a>), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the <a href="Trans-Canada%20%28highway%29">Trans-Canada</a> via <a href="Kicking%20Horse%20Pass">Kicking Horse Pass</a>, the <a href="Yellowhead%20%28highway%29">Yellowhead</a> via <a href="Yellowhead%20Pass">Yellowhead Pass</a> and the <a href="Crowsnest%20%28highway%29">Crowsnest</a> via <a href="Crowsnest%20Pass">Crowsnest Pass</a>), and one to the United States (<a href="Interstate%2015">Interstate 15</a>), as well as two international airports (<a href="Calgary%20International%20Airport">Calgary</a> and <a href="Edmonton%20International%20Airport">Edmonton</a>). Also, Alberta is connected to the <a href="TransCanada%20pipeline">TransCanada pipeline system</a> (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the <a href="Northern%20Border%20Pipeline">Northern Border Pipeline</a> (gas), <a href="Alliance%20Pipeline">Alliance Pipeline</a> (gas) and <a href="Enbridge%20Pipeline%20System">Enbridge Pipeline System</a> (oil) to the Eastern United States, the <a href="Gas%20Transmission%20Northwest">Gas Transmission Northwest</a> and <a href="Northwest%20Pipeline">Northwest Pipeline</a> (gas) to the Western United States, and the <a href="McNeill%20HVDC%20Back-to-back%20station">McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station</a> (electric power) to Saskatchewan.

Since the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the <a href="parkland%20belt">parkland belt</a> (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the <a href="North%20Saskatchewan%20River">North Saskatchewan River</a> from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20foothills">Rocky Mountain foothills</a> south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier <a href="prairie">prairie</a> (grassland) region called <a href="Palliser%27s%20Triangle">Palliser's Triangle</a> to its south, and large areas of the south (the “<a href="Special%20Areas%2C%20Alberta">Special Areas</a>”) were <a href="depopulated">depopulated</a> during the <a href="drought">drought</a>s of the 1920s and 30s. The <a href="chernozem">chernozem</a> (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the <a href="Peace%20River%20Country">Peace River Country</a> a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested <a href="Swan%20Hills">Swan Hills</a>. <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a> is the only urbanized population centre in the <a href="boreal%20forest%20of%20Canada">boreal forest</a> which covers much of the northern half of the province.

The Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province’s population. They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg. This has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.

The economic profile of the two regions is slightly different. Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands. However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies. Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton’s suburban fringes (e.g. <a href="Fort%20Saskatchewan">Fort Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="Nisku%2C%20Alberta">Nisku</a>, <a href="Strathcona%20County">Strathcona County</a> (<a href="Refinery%20Row%20%28Edmonton%29">Refinery Row</a>), <a href="Leduc%2C%20Alberta">Leduc</a>, <a href="Beaumont%2C%20Alberta">Beaumont</a>, <a href="Acheson%2C%20Alberta">Acheson</a>) are home to most of the province’s manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).

The <a href="Calgary-Edmonton%20Corridor">Calgary-Edmonton Corridor</a> is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly . In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population). It is also one of the fastest growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by <a href="TD%20Bank%20Financial%20Group">TD Bank Financial Group</a> found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.

Seeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the "Oil Capital of Canada".

Alberta has always been an <a href="export-oriented%20economy">export-oriented economy</a>. In line with <a href="Harold%20Innis">Harold Innis</a>' "<a href="Staples%20Thesis">Staples Thesis</a>", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.

The development of <a href="transportation%20in%20Alberta">transportation in Alberta</a> has been crucial to its historical economic development. The <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">North American fur trade</a> relied on <a href="birch-bark%20canoes">birch-bark canoes</a>, <a href="York%20boats">York boats</a>, and <a href="Red%20River%20carts">Red River carts</a> on <a href="buffalo%20trails">buffalo trails</a> to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>'s <a href="transcontinental%20line">transcontinental line</a> in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the <a href="grain%20trade">grain trade</a> had developed technologies to handle the <a href="bulk%20cargo">bulk</a> export of grain, especially <a href="hopper%20car">hopper car</a>s and <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a>s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing <a href="pipeline%20transport">pipeline</a> technology.

Prior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of <a href="grain%20trade">wheat</a>, <a href="beef">beef</a>, and a few other <a href="Commodity">commodities</a>. The health of economy was closely bound up with the <a href="price%20of%20wheat">price of wheat</a>.

In 1947 a major <a href="oil%20field">oil field</a> was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the <a href="price%20of%20oil">price of oil</a>, and increasingly <a href="natural%20gas%20prices">natural gas prices</a>. When oil prices spiked during the <a href="1967%20Oil%20Embargo">1967 Oil Embargo</a>, <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>, and <a href="1979%20energy%20crisis">1979 energy crisis</a>, Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the <a href="1980s%20oil%20glut">1980s oil glut</a> Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the <a href="2003%20to%202008%20world%20oil%20market%20chronology">2003-2008 oil price spike</a>. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year. By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions. By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.

The spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.

A comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three <a href="Prairie%20Provinces">Prairie Provinces</a> by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).

Alberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail. Primary industries are also of great importance, however.

By March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%— its "highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province’s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988." There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015. The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016. The <a href="Canadian%20Association%20of%20Petroleum%20Producers">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</a> (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015—25,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production. Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016. The natural resources industry lost 7,400 jobs in February. "Year-over-year (y/y), the goods sector lost 56,000 jobs, while the services sector gained 34,800." In 2015 Alberta's population increased by 3,900. While Alberta had a reprieve in job loss in February 2016—up 1,400 jobs after losing jobs in October, November, December 2015 and January 2016—Ontario lost 11,200 jobs, Saskatchewan lost 7,800 jobs and New Brunswick lost 5,700 jobs.

In 2013 171,200 people were employed in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry.

In 2007 there were 146,900 people working in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry. 

According to "<a href="Alberta%20Venture">Alberta Venture</a>" magazine's list of the 50 largest employers in the province, the largest employers are:

Alberta is the largest producer of <a href="petroleum">conventional crude oil</a>, <a href="synthetic%20crude">synthetic crude</a>, <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world’s 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer. Two of the largest producers of <a href="petrochemicals">petrochemicals</a> in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both <a href="Red%20Deer%2C%20Alberta">Red Deer</a> and <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Alberta">Edmonton</a>, world class <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="Vinyl%20group">vinyl</a> manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refineries</a> provide the raw materials for a large <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a> industry to the east of Edmonton.

The <a href="Athabasca%20Oil%20Sands">Athabasca Oil Sands</a> (sometimes known as the Athabasca <a href="Tar%20sands">Tar sands</a>) have estimated <a href="unconventional%20oil">unconventional oil</a> reserves approximately equal to the <a href="conventional%20oil">conventional oil</a> reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be . With the development of new extraction methods such as <a href="steam%20assisted%20gravity%20drainage">steam assisted gravity drainage</a> (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional <a href="surface%20mining">strip mining</a> and non-conventional <a href="in%20situ">in situ</a> methods to extract the <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a> from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about of bitumen are recoverable. <a href="Fort%20McMurray">Fort McMurray</a>, one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The <a href="oil%20price%20increases%20since%202003">oil price increases since 2003</a> made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

Alberta's economy was negatively impacted by the <a href="2016%20oil%20glut">2015-2016 oil glut</a> with a record high volume of worldwide oil <a href="inventory">inventories</a> in storage, with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices. The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in <a href="tight%20oil">shale</a> "<a href="fracking">fracking</a>" technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.

With concerted effort and support from the provincial government, several high-tech industries have found their birth in Alberta, notably patents related to interactive <a href="liquid-crystal%20display">liquid-crystal display</a> systems. With a growing economy, Alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds.

Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The <a href="Athabasca%20River">Athabasca River</a> region produces oil for internal and external use. The <a href="Athabasca%20Oil%20Sands">Athabasca Oil Sands</a> contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. <a href="Natural%20gas">Natural gas</a> has been found at several points, and in 1999, the production of natural gas liquids (<a href="ethane">ethane</a>, <a href="propane">propane</a>, and <a href="butane">butane</a>s) totalled , valued at $2.27 billion. Alberta also provides 13% of all the natural gas used in the United States.

Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat. The town of <a href="Medicine%20Hat%2C%20Alberta">Medicine Hat</a> began using gas for lighting the town, and supplying light and fuel for the people, and a number of industries using the gas for manufacturing. In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff. When <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a> visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city "with all hell for a basement".


Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities, especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer, every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the <a href="Sky%20Dome">Sky Dome</a> in Toronto.

Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation. Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity.

Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada's coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 <a href="Gigatonnes">Gigatonnes</a>.

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains. The coal belongs to the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> beds, and while not so heavy as that of the <a href="Coal%20Measures">Coal Measures</a> in England is of excellent quality. In the valley of the <a href="Bow%20River">Bow River</a>, alongside the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, valuable beds of <a href="anthracite">anthracite</a> coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of <a href="bituminous">bituminous</a> or semi-bituminous coal. These are largely worked at <a href="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a> in southern Alberta and <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Alberta">Edmonton</a> in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

, Alberta's generating capacity was 16,261 <a href="Megawatt">MW</a>, and Alberta has about of transmission lines.

Alberta has 1491 megawatts of <a href="wind%20power">wind power</a> capacity.

Production of Electricity in Alberta in 2015 by source:
Alberta has added 9,000 MW of new supply since 1998.

Peak for power use in one day was set on July 9, 2015 – 10,520 MW.

Building stones mined in Alberta include <a href="Rundle%20stone">Rundle stone</a>, and <a href="Paskapoo%20sandstone">Paskapoo sandstone</a>.

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958, and many stones have been found since, although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.

The Edmonton area, and in particular <a href="Nisku%2C%20Alberta">Nisku</a> is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment. As well Edmonton's <a href="Refinery%20Row%20%28Edmonton%29">Refinery Row</a> is home to a petrochemical industry.

According to a Statistics Canada report Alberta's manufacturing sales year-over-year sales fell 13.2 per cent, with a loss of almost four per cent from December to January. Alberta's economy continued to shrink because of the collapse of the oil and gas sector. The petroleum and coal product manufacturing industry is now third— behind food and chemicals.

Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta, for example <a href="ColdFX">ColdFX</a>.

Owing to the strength of agriculture, food processing was once a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary, but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as <a href="Brooks%2C%20Alberta">Brooks</a>, the home of <a href="XL%20Foods">XL Foods</a>, responsible for one third of Canada's beef processing in 2011.

Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities, hence the nickname "Gateway to the North". Edmonton is one <a href="CN%20Rail">CN Rail</a>'s most important hubs. Since 1996, <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

<a href="WestJet">WestJet</a>, Canada's second largest air carrier, is headquartered in Calgary, by <a href="Calgary%20International%20Airport">Calgary International Airport</a>, which serves as the airline's primary hub. Prior to its dissolution, <a href="Canadian%20Airlines">Canadian Airlines</a> was headquartered in Calgary by the airport. Prior to its dissolution, <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a> subsidiary <a href="Zip%20%28airline%29">Zip</a> was headquartered in Calgary.

In the past, <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, <a href="horse">horse</a>s, and <a href="domestic%20sheep">sheep</a> were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> is widely used. <a href="Wheat">Wheat</a>, accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by <a href="canola">canola</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="rye">rye</a>, <a href="sugar%20beets">sugar beets</a>, and other mixed farming. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of to <a href="spring%20wheat">spring wheat</a>, <a href="durum">durum</a>, barley, oats, <a href="mixed%20grains">mixed grains</a>, <a href="triticale">triticale</a>, canola and <a href="dry%20peas">dry peas</a>. Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and <a href="oilseeds">oilseeds</a> and six per cent as <a href="greenfeed">greenfeed</a> and <a href="silage">silage</a>.

<a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million <a href="cattle">cattle</a> are residents of the province at one time or another, and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains <a href="American%20Bison">buffalo (bison)</a> for the consumer market. <a href="domestic%20sheep">Sheep</a> for <a href="wool">wool</a> and <a href="Lamb%20%28food%29">lamb</a> are also <a href="sheep%20farm">raised</a>.

<a href="Wheat">Wheat</a> and <a href="canola">canola</a> are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other <a href="cereal">grains</a> also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a> is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading <a href="beekeeping">beekeeping</a> province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering <a href="Beehive%20%28beekeeping%29">hive</a>s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the <a href="Peace%20River%20%28Alberta%29">Peace River</a> valley where the season is short but the working days are long for <a href="Western%20honey%20bee">honeybee</a>s to produce honey from <a href="clover">clover</a> and <a href="fireweed">fireweed</a>. <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybrid</a> <a href="canola">canola</a> also requires <a href="bee">bee</a> <a href="pollination">pollination</a>, and some beekeepers service this need.

The vast northern <a href="forest">forest</a> reserves of <a href="softwood">softwood</a> allow Alberta to produce large quantities of <a href="lumber">lumber</a>, <a href="Oriented%20strand%20board">oriented strand board (OSB)</a> and <a href="plywood">plywood</a>, and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the <a href="Pacific%20Rim">Pacific Rim</a> <a href="nation">nation</a>s with bleached <a href="wood%20pulp">wood pulp</a> and <a href="newsprint">newsprint</a>.

In 1999, <a href="lumber">lumber</a> products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

Despite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. By January 2016 that number had increased to 1,668.5 thousand and by February 2016 to 1,670.6 thousand. This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.

The <a href="TSX%20Venture%20Exchange">TSX Venture Exchange</a> is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the <a href="Security%20%28finance%29">securities</a> market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.

Edmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: <a href="Canadian%20Western%20Bank">Canadian Western Bank</a>, and <a href="ATB%20Financial">ATB Financial</a>, as well as the only province-wide <a href="credit%20union">credit union</a>, <a href="Servus">Servus</a>.

Despite Alberta's reputation as a "small government" province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100,000 with the average weekly wage at $1,163—23 per cent higher than the Canadian national average. Alberta has the "lowest taxes overall of any province or territory" in Canada.
