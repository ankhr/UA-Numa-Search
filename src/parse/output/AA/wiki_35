Bethlehem

Bethlehem (; , "House of Meat"; "", , "House of Bread"; ; ) is a <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestinian</a> city located in the central <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>, <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">Palestine</a>, about south of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Its population is approximately 25,000 people. It is the capital of the <a href="Bethlehem%20Governorate">Bethlehem Governorate</a>. The economy is primarily <a href="Tourism%20in%20the%20Palestinian%20territories">tourist-driven</a>.

The earliest known mention of the city was in the <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna correspondence</a> of 1350–1330 BCE during its habitation by the <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>ites. The <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, which says that the city of Bethlehem was built up as a fortified city by <a href="Rehoboam">Rehoboam</a>, identifies it as the city <a href="David">David</a> was from and where he was crowned as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">king of Israel</a>. The <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Bethlehem was destroyed by the Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> during the second-century <a href="Bar%20Kokhba%20revolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a>; its rebuilding was promoted by Empress <a href="Helena%20%28empress%29">Helena</a>, mother of <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, who commissioned the building of its great <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a> in 327 CE. The church was badly damaged by the <a href="Samaritans">Samaritans</a>, who sacked it during a <a href="Samaritan%20Revolts">revolt</a> in 529, but was rebuilt a century later by Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>.

Bethlehem became part of <a href="Jund%20Filastin">Jund Filastin</a> following the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">Muslim conquest</a> in 637. Muslim rule continued in Bethlehem until its conquest in 1099 by a <a href="Crusades">crusading army</a>, who replaced the town's <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a> clergy with a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Latin</a> one. In the mid-13th century, the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluks</a> demolished the city's walls, which were subsequently rebuilt under the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a> in the early 16th century. Control of Bethlehem passed from the Ottomans to the British at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Bethlehem came under Jordanian rule during the <a href="1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a> and was later captured by <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in the 1967 <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a>. Since the 1995 <a href="West%20Bank%20Areas%20in%20the%20Oslo%20II%20Accord">Oslo Accords</a>, Bethlehem has been administered by the <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian Authority</a>.

Bethlehem now has a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> majority, but is still home to a significant <a href="Palestinian%20Christians">Palestinian Christian</a> community. Bethlehem's chief <a href="economy">economic sector</a> is tourism, which peaks during the <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> season when Christians make pilgrimage to the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a>, as they have done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. <a href="Rachel%27s%20Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a>, an important Jewish holy site, is located at the northern entrance of Bethlehem.

The earliest reference to Bethlehem appears in the <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna correspondence</a> (c. 1400 BCE). In one of his six letters to Pharaoh, <a href="Abdi-Heba">Abdi-Heba</a>, Egypt's governor for Jerusalem, appeals for aid in retaking ""Bit-Lahmi"" in the wake of disturbances by <a href="Habiru">Apiru</a> mercenaries: "now even a town near Jerusalem, Bit-Lahmi by name, a village which once belonged to the king, has fallen to the enemy . . . Let the king hear the words of your servant Abdi-Heba, and send archers to restore the imperial lands of the king!"

It is thought that the similarity of this name to its modern forms indicates that this was a settlement of Canaanites who shared a Semitic cultural and linguistic heritage with the later arrivals. "<a href="Lahmu">Lachmo</a>" was the <a href="Mesopotamian%20mythology">Chaldean</a> god of fertility, worshipped by the <a href="Canaan%23Canaan%20in%20the%20Bible">Canaanites</a> as "<a href="Lahamu">Lachama</a>". Some time in the 3rd millennium BCE, they erected a temple to worship the god on the hill now known as the Hill of the Nativity. The town was known as "Beit Lachama", meaning "House of Lachama." The <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a> later established a garrison there. <a href="William%20F.%20Albright">William F. Albright</a> notes that the pronunciation of the name remained essentially the same for 3,500 years, but has meant different things: "'Temple of the God Lakhmu' in Canaanite, 'House of Bread' in Hebrew and <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a>, 'House of Meat' in Arabic."

A burial ground discovered in spring 2013, and surveyed in 2015 by a joint Italian-Palestinian team found that the necropolis covered 3 hectares (more than 7 acres) and originally contained more than 100 tombs in use between roughly 2200 B.C. and 650 B.C. The archaeologists were able to identify at least 30 tombs.

Archaeological confirmation of Bethlehem as a city in the Kingdom of Judah was uncovered in 2012 at the archaeological dig at the <a href="City%20of%20David">City of David</a> in the form of a "<a href="Bulla%20%28seal%29">bulla</a>" (seal impression in dried clay) in ancient Hebrew script that reads "From the town of Bethlehem to the King," indicating that it was used to seal the string closing a shipment of grain, wine, or other goods sent as a tax payment in the 8th or 7th century BCE.

Biblical scholars believe Bethlehem, located in the "hill country" of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, may be the same as the Biblical <a href="Ephrath">Ephrath</a>, which means "fertile", as there is a reference to it in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Micah">pageRank.Book of Micah</a> as Bethlehem Ephratah. The Bible also calls it Beth-Lehem Judah, and the New Testament describes it as the "City of David". It is first mentioned in the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> and the Bible as the place where the matriarch <a href="Rachel">Rachel</a> died and was buried "by the wayside" (Gen. 48:7). <a href="Rachel%27s%20Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a>, the traditional grave site, stands at the entrance to Bethlehem. According to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ruth">pageRank.Book of Ruth</a>, the valley to the east is where <a href="Ruth%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Ruth</a> of <a href="Moab">Moab</a> gleaned the fields and returned to town with <a href="Naomi%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Naomi</a>. It was the home of <a href="Jesse">Jesse</a>, father of King <a href="David">David</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">Israel</a>, and the site of David's anointment by the prophet <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>. It was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his warriors brought him water when he was hiding in the cave of <a href="Adullam">Adullam</a>.

Writing in the 4th century, the <a href="Itinerarium%20Burdigalense">Pilgrim of Bordeaux</a> reported that the sepulchers of <a href="David">David</a>, <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="Asaph%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Asaph</a>, <a href="Job%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Job</a>, <a href="Jesse">Jesse</a>, and <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> were located near Bethlehem. There has been no corroboration of this.

After the <a href="Bar%20Kokhba%20revolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a> was crushed, <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> converted the Christian site above the Grotto into a shrine dedicated to the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> god <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>, to honour his favourite, the Greek youth <a href="Antinous">Antinous</a>. Some scholars hold the view that this site was one that had originally been dedicated to Adonis-Tammuz and Christians had taken it over.

In 326–328, the empress <a href="Helena%20%28empress%29">Helena</a>, <a href="queen%20consort">consort</a> of the emperor <a href="Constantius%20Chlorus">Constantius Chlorus</a>, and mother of the emperor <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, made a pilgrimage to Syra-Palaestina, in the course of which she visited the ruins of Bethlehem. The empress promoted the rebuilding of the city, and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> of Caesarea writes that she was responsible for the construction of the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a>.

During the <a href="Samaritan%20Revolts">Samaritan revolt</a> of 529, Bethlehem was sacked and its walls and the Church of the Nativity destroyed; they were rebuilt on the orders of the Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>. In 614, the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Persian Sassanid Empire</a>, supported by <a href="Jewish%20revolt%20against%20Heraclius">Jewish rebels</a>, invaded <a href="Palaestina%20Prima">Palestina Prima</a> and captured Bethlehem. A story recounted in later sources holds that they refrained from destroying the church on seeing the <a href="magi">magi</a> depicted in <a href="Persian%20art">Persian</a> clothing in a mosaic.

In 637, shortly after <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28637%29">Jerusalem was captured</a> by the <a href="Rashidun%20army">Muslim armies</a>, <a href="Umar">'Umar ibn al-Khattāb</a>, the second <a href="Caliphate">Caliph</a>, promised that the Church of the Nativity would be preserved for Christian use. A <a href="Mosque%20of%20Omar%20%28Bethlehem%29">mosque</a> dedicated to Umar was built upon the place in the city where he prayed, next to the church. Bethlehem then passed through the control of the Islamic caliphates of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyads</a> in the 8th century, then the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasids</a> in the 9th century. A <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> geographer recorded in the mid-9th century that a well preserved and much venerated church existed in the town. In 985, the <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> geographer <a href="al-Muqaddasi">al-Muqaddasi</a> visited Bethlehem, and referred to its church as the "Basilica of Constantine, the equal of which does not exist anywhere in the country-round." In 1009, during the reign of the sixth Fatimid Caliph, <a href="al-Hakim%20bi-Amr%20Allah">al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah</a>, the Church of the Nativity was ordered to be demolished, but was spared by local Muslims, because they had been permitted to worship in the structure's southern transept.

In 1099, Bethlehem was captured by the <a href="First%20Crusade">Crusaders</a>, who fortified it and built a new monastery and cloister on the north side of the Church of the Nativity. The <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a> clergy were removed from their <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> and replaced with <a href="Catholic%20Church">Latin</a> clerics. Up until that point the official Christian presence in the region was Greek Orthodox. On Christmas Day 1100, <a href="Baldwin%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin I</a>, first king of the Frankish <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>, was crowned in Bethlehem, and that year a Latin episcopate was also established in the town.

In 1187, <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the Sultan of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Syria">Syria</a> who led the <a href="Ayyubid%20dynasty">Muslim Ayyubids</a>, captured Bethlehem from the Crusaders. The Latin clerics were forced to leave, allowing the Greek Orthodox clergy to return. Saladin agreed to the return of two Latin priests and two deacons in 1192. However, Bethlehem suffered from the loss of the pilgrim trade, as there was a sharp decrease of European pilgrims. <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Nevers">William IV, Count of Nevers</a> had promised the Christian bishops of Bethlehem that if Bethlehem should fall under Muslim control, he would welcome them in the small town of <a href="Clamecy%2C%20Ni%C3%A8vre">Clamecy</a> in present-day <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, France. As a result, the Bishop of Bethlehem duly took up residence in the hospital of Panthenor, Clamecy, in 1223. Clamecy remained the continuous '<a href="Titular%20see">in partibus infidelium</a>' seat of the Bishopric of Bethlehem for almost 600 years, until the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> in 1789.

Bethlehem, along with Jerusalem, <a href="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>, and <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, was briefly ceded to the Crusader <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> by a treaty between <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a> and Ayyubid Sultan <a href="al-Kamil">al-Kamil</a> in 1229, in return for a ten-year truce between the Ayyubids and the Crusaders. The treaty expired in 1239, and Bethlehem was recaptured by the Muslims in 1244. In 1250, with the coming to power of the <a href="Mamluk">Mamluk</a>s under <a href="Baibars">Rukn al-Din Baibars</a>, tolerance of Christianity declined. Members of the clergy left the city, and in 1263 the town walls were demolished. The Latin clergy returned to Bethlehem the following century, establishing themselves in the monastery adjoining the Basilica of the Nativity. The Greek Orthodox were given control of the basilica and shared control of the Milk Grotto with the Latins and the <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenians</a>.

From 1517, during the years of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> control, custody of the Basilica was bitterly disputed between the Catholic and Greek <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox churches</a>. By the end of the 16th century, Bethlehem had become one of the largest villages in the District of Jerusalem, and was subdivided into seven quarters. The Basbus family served as the heads of Bethlehem among other leaders during this period. The Ottoman tax record and census from 1596 indicates that Bethlehem had a population of 1,435, making it the 13th largest village in Palestine at the time. Its total revenue amounted to 30,000 <a href="Ak%C3%A7e">akce</a>.

Bethlehem paid taxes on wheat, barley and grapes. The Muslims and Christians were organized into separate communities, each having its own leader. Five leaders represented the village in the mid-16th century, three of whom were Muslims. Ottoman tax records suggest that the Christian population was slightly more prosperous or grew more grain than grapes (the former being a more valuable commodity).

From 1831 to 1841, Palestine was under the rule of the <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20dynasty">Muhammad Ali Dynasty</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. During this period, the town suffered <a href="Galilee%20earthquake%20of%201837">an earthquake</a> as well as the destruction of the Muslim quarter in 1834 by Egyptian troops, apparently as a reprisal for the murder of a favored loyalist of <a href="Ibrahim%20Pasha%20of%20Egypt">Ibrahim Pasha</a>. In 1841, Bethlehem came under Ottoman rule once again and remained so until the end of World War I. Under the Ottomans, Bethlehem's inhabitants faced unemployment, <a href="Conscription">compulsory military service</a>, and heavy taxes, resulting in mass emigration, particularly to <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. An American missionary in the 1850s reported a population of under 4,000, nearly all of whom belonged to the Greek Church. He also noted that a lack of water crippled the town's growth.

<a href="Albert%20Socin">Socin</a> found from an official Ottoman village list from about 1870 that Bethlehem had a population of 179 Muslims in 59 houses, 979 "Latins" in 256 houses, 824 "Greeks" in 213 houses, and 41 Armenians in 11 houses, a total of 539 houses. The population count included men, only. <a href="Martin%20Hartmann">Hartmann</a> found that Bethlehem had 520 houses.

Bethlehem was administered by the <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine%20%28legal%20instrument%29">British Mandate</a> from 1920 to 1948. In the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>'s <a href="United%20Nations%20Partition%20Plan%20for%20Palestine">1947 resolution to partition Palestine</a>, Bethlehem was included in the special <a href="Corpus%20separatum%20%28Jerusalem%29">international enclave of Jerusalem</a> to be administered by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>.
<a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> captured the city during the <a href="1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. Many refugees from areas captured by <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i forces in 1947–48 fled to the Bethlehem area, primarily settling in what became the official refugee camps of <a href="%27Azza">'Azza</a> (Beit Jibrin) and <a href="Aida%20Camp">'Aida</a> in the north and <a href="Dheisheh">Dheisheh</a> in the south. The influx of refugees significantly transformed Bethlehem's Christian majority into a Muslim one.

Jordan retained control of the city until the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, along with the rest of the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>. Following the Six-Day War, Israel took control of the city. In 1995, Israel turned it over to the Palestinian National Authority in accordance with the <a href="Oslo%20II%20Accord">Oslo peace accord</a>.

Today, the city is surrounded by two bypass roads for settlers, leaving the inhabitants squeezed between 37 Jewish enclaves, where a quarter of all West Bank settlers, roughly 170,000, live, and the gap between the two roads closed by the 8-metre high <a href="Israeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>, which cuts Bethlehem off from its sister city Jerusalem.

On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops withdrew from Bethlehem, and three days later the city came under the complete administration and military control of the <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian National Authority</a> in conformance with the <a href="Oslo%20II%20Accord">Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip</a> in 1995.
During the <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Palestinian Intifada</a> in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's infrastructure and <a href="tourism">tourism</a> industry were damaged. In 2002, it was a primary combat zone in <a href="Operation%20Defensive%20Shield">Operation Defensive Shield</a>, a major military counteroffensive by the <a href="Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli Defense Forces</a> (IDF). During the counteroffensive, the IDF <a href="Siege%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20the%20Nativity%20in%20Bethlehem">besieged the Church of the Nativity</a>, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted for 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the wanted militants to various foreign countries.

Bethlehem is located at an elevation of about <a href="Metres%20above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>, higher than nearby <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Bethlehem is situated on the southern portion in the <a href="Judaean%20Mountains">Judean Mountains</a>.

The city is located northeast of <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza City</a> and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, west of <a href="Amman">Amman</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, southeast of <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and south of Jerusalem. Nearby cities and towns include <a href="Beit%20Safafa">Beit Safafa</a> and Jerusalem to the north, <a href="Beit%20Jala">Beit Jala</a> to the northwest, <a href="Husan">Husan</a> to the west, <a href="Al-Khader">al-Khadr</a> and <a href="Artas%2C%20Bethlehem">Artas</a> to the southwest, and <a href="Beit%20Sahour">Beit Sahour</a> to the east. Beit Jala and the latter form an <a href="Urban%20agglomeration">agglomeration</a> with Bethlehem. The <a href="Aida%20Camp">Aida</a> and <a href="%27Azza">Azza</a> refugee camps are located within the city limits.

In the center of Bethlehem is its old city. The old city consists of eight quarters, laid out in a mosaic style, forming the area around the Manger Square. The quarters include the Christian an-Najajreh, al-Farahiyeh, al-Anatreh, al-Tarajmeh, al-Qawawsa and Hreizat quarters and al-Fawaghreh — the only Muslim quarter. Most of the Christian quarters are named after the Arab <a href="Ghassanids">Ghassanid</a> clans that settled there. Al-Qawawsa Quarter was formed by <a href="Arab%20Christians">Arab Christian</a> emigrants from the nearby town of <a href="Tuqu%27">Tuqu'</a> in the 18th century. There is also a <a href="Assyrian%20people">Syriac</a> quarter outside of the old city, whose inhabitants originate from <a href="Midyat">Midyat</a> and Ma'asarte in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. The total population of the old city is about 5,000.

Bethlehem has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>, with hot and dry summers and mild, wetter winters. Winter temperatures (mid-December to mid-March) can be cool and rainy. January is the coldest month, with temperatures ranging from 1 to 13 degree Celsius (33–55 °F). From May through September, the weather is warm and sunny. August is the hottest month, with a high of 30 degrees Celsius (86 °F). Bethlehem receives an average of of rainfall annually, 70% between November and January.

Bethlehem's average annual relative <a href="humidity">humidity</a> is 60% and reaches its highest rates between January and February. Humidity levels are at their lowest in May. Night dew may occur in up to 180 days per year. The city is influenced by the Mediterranean Sea breeze that occurs around mid-day. However, Bethlehem is affected also by annual waves of hot, dry, sandy and dust "Khamaseen" winds from the <a href="Arabian%20Desert">Arabian Desert</a>, during April, May and mid-June.

According to Ottoman tax records, Christians made up roughly 60% of the population in the early 16th century, while the Christian and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> population became equal by the mid-16th century. However, there were no Muslim inhabitants counted by the end of the century, with a recorded population of 287 adult male tax-payers. Christians, like all non-Muslims throughout the Ottoman Empire, were required to pay the <a href="jizya">jizya</a> tax. In 1867 an American visitor describes the town as having a population of 3,000 to 4,000; of whom about 100 were <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a>, 300 were Muslims and "the remainder belonging to the Latin and Greek Churches with a few Armenians." Another report from the same year puts the Christian population at 3,000, with an additional 50 Muslims. An 1885 source put the population at approximately 6,000 of "principally Christians, Latins and Greeks" with no Jewish inhabitants.

In 1948, the religious makeup of the city was 85% Christian, mostly of the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic denominations, and 13% Muslim. In the 1967 census taken by Israel authorities, the town of Bethlehem proper numbered 14,439 inhabitants, its 7,790 Muslim inhabitants represented 53.9% of the population, while the Christians of various denominations numbered 6,231 or 46.1%.

In the PCBS's 1997 census, the city had a population of 21,670, including a total of 6,570 <a href="Palestinian%20refugees">refugees</a>, accounting for 30.3% of the city's population. In 1997, the age distribution of Bethlehem's inhabitants was 27.4% under the age of 10, 20% from 10 to 19, 17.3% from 20–29, 17.7% from 30 to 44, 12.1% from 45–64 and 5.3% above the age of 65. There were 11,079 males and 10,594 females. In the 2007 PCBS census, Bethlehem had a population of 25,266, of which 12,753 were males and 12,513 were females. There were 6,709 housing units, of which 5,211 were households. The average household consisted of 4.8 family members.

After the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">Muslim conquest of the Levant</a> in the 630s, the local Christians were <a href="Arabization">Arabized</a> even though large numbers were ethnically Arabs of the Ghassanid clans. Bethlehem's two largest Arab Christian clans trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids, including al-Farahiyyah and an-Najajreh. The former have descended from the Ghassanids who migrated from <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> and from the <a href="Wadi%20Musa">Wadi Musa</a> area in present-day <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> and an-Najajreh descend from <a href="Najran">Najran</a>. Another Bethlehem clan, al-Anatreh, also trace their ancestry to the Ghassanids.

The percentage of Christians in the town has been steadily declining over the years, primarily due to emigration. The lower birth rate of Christians also accounts for some of the decline. In 1947, Christians made up 85% of the population, but by 1998 the figure had declined to 40%. In 2005, the mayor of Bethlehem, <a href="Victor%20Batarseh">Victor Batarseh</a> explained that "due to the stress, either physical or psychological, and the bad economic situation, many people are emigrating, either Christians or Muslims, but it is more apparent among Christians, because they already are a minority." The Palestinian Authority is officially committed to equality for Christians, although there have been incidents of violence against them by the <a href="Preventive%20Security%20Force">Preventive Security Service</a> and militant factions. The only mosque in the Old City is the <a href="Mosque%20of%20Omar%20%28Bethlehem%29">Mosque of Omar</a>, located in the Manger Square.

The outbreak of the <a href="Second%20Intifada">Second Intifada</a> and the resulting decrease in tourism also affected the Christian minority, since they are the owners of many Bethlehem hotels and services that cater to foreign tourists. A <a href="statistics">statistical analysis</a> of the Christian exodus cited lack of economic and educational opportunity, especially due to the Christians' <a href="middle%20class">middle-class</a> status and <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a>. Since the Second Intifada, 10% of the Christian population have left the city.

In 2006, the Palestinian Centre for Research and Cultural Dialogue conducted a poll among the city's Christians according to which 90% said they had had Muslim friends, 73.3% agreed that the PNA treated Christian heritage in the city with respect and 78% attributed the exodus of Christians to the Israeli blockade. However, it is likely that there are many factors, most of which are shared with the Palestinian population as a whole.

Shopping is a major attraction, especially during the <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> season. The city's main streets and old markets are lined with shops selling <a href="Palestinian%20handicrafts">Palestinian handicrafts</a>, <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>ern spices, jewelry and oriental sweets such as <a href="baklava">baklawa</a>. Olive <a href="wood%20carving">wood carving</a>s are the item most purchased by tourists visiting Bethlehem. Religious handicrafts include ornaments handmade from <a href="Nacre">mother-of-pearl</a>, as well as olive wood statues, boxes, and crosses. Other industries include stone and marble-cutting, textiles, furniture and furnishings. Bethlehem factories also produce paints, plastics, <a href="synthetic%20rubber">synthetic rubber</a>, pharmaceuticals, construction materials and food products, mainly pasta and confectionery.

<a href="Cremisan%20Valley">Cremisan Wine</a>, founded in 1885, is a winery run by monks in the Monastery of Cremisan. The grapes are grown mainly in the <a href="al-Khader">al-Khader</a> district. In 2007, the monastery's wine production was around 700,000 liters per year.

In 2008, Bethlehem hosted the largest <a href="Palestine%20Investment%20Conference">economic conference</a> to date in the <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a>. It was initiated by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian Prime Minister</a> and former <a href="Finance%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Finance Minister</a> <a href="Salam%20Fayyad">Salam Fayyad</a> to convince more than a thousand businessmen, bankers and government officials from throughout the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> to invest in the West Bank and <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. A total of 1.4 billion US dollars was secured for business investments in the Palestinian territories.

Tourism is Bethlehem's main industry. Unlike other Palestinian localities prior to 2000, the majority of the employed residents did not have jobs in Israel. More than 20% of the working population is employed in the industry. Tourism accounts for approximately 65% of the city's economy and 11% of the <a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestinian National Authority</a>. The city has more than two million visitors every year.

The <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">Church of the Nativity</a> is one of Bethlehem's major <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>s and a magnet for Christian pilgrims. It stands in the center of the city — a part of the <a href="Manger%20Square">Manger Square</a> — over a grotto or cave called the Holy Crypt, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Nearby is the Milk Grotto where the Holy Family took refuge on their Flight to Egypt and next door is the cave where <a href="Jerome">St. Jerome</a> spent thirty years creating the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, the dominant Latin version of the Bible until the Reformation.

There are over thirty hotels in Bethlehem. <a href="Jacir%20Palace">Jacir Palace</a>, built in 1910 near the church, is one of Bethlehem's most successful hotels and its oldest. It was closed down in 2000 due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but reopened in 2005 as the Jacir Palace InterContinental at Bethlehem.

Early Christian traditions describe <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> as being born in Bethlehem: in one, a verse in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Micah">pageRank.Book of Micah</a> is interpreted as a prophecy that the <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a> would be born there. The <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> has two different accounts of the birth. In the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>' parents live in <a href="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> and travel for the <a href="Census%20of%20Quirinius">Census of Quirinius</a> to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born, after which they return home. The <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> mentions Bethlehem but not the census. Told that a 'King of the Jews' has been born in the town, Herod orders the killing of all the boys aged two and under in the town and surrounding area. <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a>, warned of by an <a href="angel%20of%20the%20Lord">angel of the Lord</a>, flees to Egypt with his family; the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a> later settles in Nazareth.

Many modern scholars question the idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply a connection to the lineage of King David. The <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in "<a href="Archaeology%20%28magazine%29">Archaeology</a>" magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in <a href="Bethlehem%20of%20Galilee">Bethlehem of Galilee</a>. In a 2011 article in "<a href="Biblical%20Archaeology%20Review">Biblical Archaeology Review</a>" magazine, <a href="Jerome%20Murphy-O%27Connor">Jerome Murphy-O'Connor</a> argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.

The existence of early traditions of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is attested by the <a href="Christian%20apologetics">Christian apologist</a> <a href="Justin%20Martyr">Justin Martyr</a>, who stated in his "<a href="Dialogue%20with%20Trypho">Dialogue with Trypho</a>" (c. 155–161) that the <a href="Holy%20Family">Holy Family</a> had taken refuge in a cave outside of the town. <a href="Origen">Origen</a> of Alexandria, writing around the year 247, referred to a cave in the town of Bethlehem which local people believed was the birthplace of Jesus. This cave was possibly one which had previously been a site of the cult of <a href="Tammuz%20%28deity%29">Tammuz</a>.

Christmas rites are held in Bethlehem on three different dates: December 25 is the traditional date by the Roman Catholic and <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> denominations, but Greek, <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic</a> and <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syrian Orthodox</a> Christians celebrate Christmas on January 6 and <a href="Armenian%20Apostolic%20Church">Armenian Orthodox</a> Christians on January 19. Most Christmas processions pass through Manger Square, the plaza outside the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">Basilica of the Nativity</a>. Roman Catholic services take place in <a href="St.%20Catherine%27s%20Church%20%28Bethlehem%29">St. Catherine's Church</a> and Protestants often hold services at Shepherds' Fields.

Bethlehem celebrates festivals related to saints and prophets associated with Palestinian folklore. One such festival is the annual <a href="Feast%20of%20Saint%20George">Feast of Saint George</a> (<a href="Khidr">al-Khadr</a>) on 5–6 May. During the celebrations, Greek Orthodox Christians from the city march in procession to the nearby town of <a href="al-Khader">al-Khader</a> to baptize newborns in the waters around the <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Monastery%2C%20Al-Khader">Monastery of St. George</a> and sacrifice a sheep in ritual. The Feast of St. <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> is commemorated by a procession to Mar Elias, a Greek Orthodox monastery north of Bethlehem.

The women embroiderers of Bethlehem were known for their bridalwear. Bethlehem embroidery was renowned for its "strong overall effect of colors and metallic brilliance." Less formal dresses were made of indigo fabric with a sleeveless coat ("bisht") from locally woven wool worn over top. Dresses for special occasions were made of striped silk with winged sleeves with a short "taqsireh" jacket known as the Bethlehem jacket. The taqsireh was made of <a href="velvet">velvet</a> or <a href="broadcloth">broadcloth</a>, usually with heavy embroidery.

Bethlehem work was unique in its use of couched gold or silver cord, or silk cord onto the silk, wool, felt or velvet used for the garment, to create stylized floral patterns with free or rounded lines. This technique was used for "royal" <a href="wedding%20dress">wedding dress</a>es ("thob malak"), taqsirehs and the "shatwehs" worn by married women. It has been traced by some to <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>, and by others to the formal costumes of the Ottoman Empire's elite. As a Christian village, local women were also exposed to the detailing on church vestments with their heavy embroidery and silver brocade.

The art of <a href="Mother-of-Pearl%20carving%20in%20Bethlehem">mother-of-pearl carving</a> is said to have been a Bethlehem tradition since the 15th century when it was introduced by <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="friar">friar</a>s from <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. A constant stream of <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a>s generated a demand for these items, which also provided jobs for women. The industry was noted by <a href="Richard%20Pococke">Richard Pococke</a>, who visited Bethlehem in 1727.

Bethlehem is home to the <a href="Palestinian%20Heritage%20Center">Palestinian Heritage Center</a>, established in 1991. The center aims to preserve and promote Palestinian embroidery, <a href="Palestinian%20art">art</a> and folklore. The International Center of Bethlehem is another cultural center that concentrates primarily on the culture of Bethlehem. It provides language and guide training, woman's studies and <a href="Handicraft">arts and crafts</a> displays, and training.

The Bethlehem branch of <a href="the%20Edward%20Said%20National%20Conservatory%20of%20Music">the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music</a> has about 500 students. Its primary goals are to teach children music, train teachers for other schools, sponsor music research, and the study of Palestinian folklore music.

Bethlehem has four museums: The Crib of the Nativity Theatre and Museum offers visitors 31 3D models depicting the significant stages of the life of Jesus. Its theater presents a 20-minute animated show. The <a href="Badd%20Giacaman%20Museum">Badd Giacaman Museum</a>, located in the Old City of Bethlehem, dates back to the 18th century and is primarily dedicated to the history and process of <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a> production. <a href="Baituna%20al-Talhami%20Museum">Baituna al-Talhami Museum</a>, established in 1972, contains displays of Bethlehem culture. The International Museum of Nativity was built by <a href="UNESCO">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) to exhibit "high artistic quality in an evocative atmosphere".

Bethlehem is the "muhfaza" (seat) or district capital of the <a href="Bethlehem%20Governorate">Bethlehem Governorate</a>.

Bethlehem held its first municipal elections in 1876, after the "mukhtars" ("heads") of the quarters of Bethlehem's Old City (excluding the Syriac Quarter) made the decision to elect a local council of seven members to represent each clan in the town. A <a href="Basic%20law">Basic Law</a> was established so that if the victor for mayor was a Catholic, his deputy should be of the Greek Orthodox community.

Throughout, Bethlehem's rule by the British and Jordan, the Syriac Quarter was allowed to participate in the election, as were the Ta'amrah <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a>s and Palestinian refugees, hence ratifying the number of municipal members in the council to 11. In 1976, an amendment was passed to allow women to vote and become council members and later the voting age was increased from 21 to 25.

Today, the Bethlehem Municipal Council consists of 15 elected members, including the mayor and deputy mayor. A special statute requires that the mayor and a majority of the municipal council be Christian, while the remainder are open seats, not restricted to any religion.

There are several branches of political parties on the council, including <a href="Communism">Communist</a>, <a href="Islamism">Islamist</a>, and secular. The leftist factions of the <a href="Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) such as the <a href="Popular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a> (PFLP) and the <a href="Palestinian%20People%27s%20Party">Palestinian People's Party</a> (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a> gained the majority of the open seats in the 2005 <a href="Palestinian%20local%20elections%2C%202004%E2%80%932005">Palestinian municipal elections</a>.

The mayor and the deputy mayor of Bethlehem are required by municipal law to be Christian. In the October 2012 municipal elections, Fatah member Vera Baboun won, becoming the first female mayor of Bethlehem.
According to the <a href="Palestinian%20Central%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics</a> (PCBS), in 1997, approximately 84% of Bethlehem's population over the age of 10 was literate. Of the city's population, 10,414 were enrolled in schools (4,015 in <a href="primary%20education">primary school</a>, 3,578 in secondary and 2,821 in high school). About 14.1% of high school students received diplomas. There were 135 schools in the <a href="Bethlehem%20Governorate">Bethlehem Governorate</a> in 2006; 100 run the <a href="Education%20Minister%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Education Ministry of the Palestinian National Authority</a>, seven by the <a href="UNRWA">United Nations Relief and Works Agency</a> (UNRWA) and 28 were private.

Bethlehem is home to <a href="Bethlehem%20University">Bethlehem University</a>, a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Christian co-educational institution of higher learning founded in 1973 in the Lasallian tradition, open to students of all faiths. Bethlehem University is the first university established in the West Bank, and can trace its roots to 1893 when the <a href="Institute%20of%20the%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Christian%20Schools">De La Salle Christian Brothers</a> opened schools throughout Palestine and Egypt.

Bethlehem has three bus stations owned by private companies which offer service to Jerusalem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahour, <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a>, <a href="Nahalin">Nahalin</a>, <a href="Battir">Battir</a>, <a href="al-Khader">al-Khader</a>, <a href="al-Ubeidiya">al-Ubeidiya</a> and <a href="Beit%20Fajjar">Beit Fajjar</a>. There are two taxi stations that make trips to Beit Sahour, Beit Jala, Jerusalem, <a href="Tuqu%27">Tuqu'</a> and <a href="Herodium">Herodium</a>. There are also two car rental departments: Murad and 'Orabi. Buses and taxis with West Bank licenses are not allowed to enter Israel, including Jerusalem, without a permit.

The Israeli construction of the <a href="Israeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier">West Bank barrier</a> has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida <a href="refugee%20camp">refugee camp</a> on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration to the rest of the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> are currently subjected to <a href="Israeli%20checkpoint">Israeli checkpoint</a>s and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of <a href="Rachel%27s%20Tomb">Rachel's Tomb</a>. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical <a href="Solomon%27s%20Pools">Solomon's Pools</a>.

Benjamin

Benjamin was the last-born of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a>'s thirteen children (12 sons and 1 daughter), and the second and last son of <a href="Rachel">Rachel</a> in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition. He was the progenitor of the <a href="Israelites">Israelite</a> <a href="Tribe%20of%20Benjamin">Tribe of Benjamin</a>. In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> unlike Rachel's first son, <a href="Joseph%20%28Genesis%29">Joseph</a>, Benjamin was born in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>.

In the <a href="Samaritan%20Pentateuch">Samaritan Pentateuch</a>, Benjamin's name appears as "Binyaamem" (). In the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child, who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being <a href="Chileab">Chileab</a>, <a href="Jesse">Jesse</a> and <a href="Amram">Amram</a>.

According to the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, Benjamin's name arose when Jacob deliberately corrupted the name "Benoni", the original name of "Benjamin", since "Benoni" was an allusion to Rachel's dying just after she had given birth, as it means "son of my pain". Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the <a href="Jahwist">Jahwist</a> and the other being the <a href="Elohist">Elohist</a>.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the name interpreted as "son of the right side". Being associated with the right hand side was traditionally a reference to strength and virtue (cf. "<a href="wikt%3Asinister">sinister</a>", which derives from the Latin for "left"). This is not the only literal translation, as the <a href="root%20word">root</a> for "right" is identical to that for "south", hence "Benjamin" also literally translates as "son of the south". This meaning is advocated by several <a href="classical%20rabbinical%20literature">classical rabbinical sources</a>, which argue that it refers to the birth of Benjamin in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, as compared with the birth of all the other sons of Jacob in <a href="Aram-Naharaim">Aram</a>. Modern scholars have instead proposed that, with the eponymous Benjamin being just a metaphor, "son of the south" / "son of the right" are references to the tribe's being subordinate to the more dominant tribe of Ephraim.

Inside the <a href="Samaritan%20Pentateuch">Samaritan Pentateuch</a>, the name is consistently written as בן ימים, with a terminal <a href="mem">mem</a>, making it "Benjamim", and would literally translate as "spirit man". Some classical rabbinical literature argues that this was the original form of the name and was a reference to the advanced age of Jacob when Benjamin was born.

According to classical rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after <a href="Rachel">Rachel</a> had <a href="fasted">fasted</a> for a long time, as a religious devotion with the hope of a new child as a reward. By then <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> had become over 100 years old. Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative, but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons. Textual scholars believe that this is the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the <a href="Jahwist">Jahwist</a> and <a href="Elohist">Elohist</a> narratives, which make up most of the <a href="Joseph%20%28Genesis%29">Joseph</a> narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.

The Torah's Joseph narrative, at a stage when Joseph is unrecognised by his brothers, describes Joseph as testing whether his brothers have reformed by secretly planting a silver cup in Benjamin's bag. Then, publicly searching the bags for it, and after "finding" it in Benjamin's possession, demanding that Benjamin become his <a href="slave">slave</a> as a punishment.

The narrative goes on to state that when <a href="Judah%20%28son%20of%20Jacob%29">Judah</a> (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob's heart. This caused Joseph to recant and reveal his identity. The <a href="Sefer%20haYashar%20%28midrash%29">midrashic book of Jasher</a> argues that prior to revealing his identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, using an <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a>-like tool. It continues by stating that Benjamin <a href="divination">divined</a> that the "man on the throne" was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.

Some classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on the memory of Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important to him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.

In the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, and he gives Benjamin five times as much food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.

The <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, in the narrative of <a href="Joseph%20in%20Islam">Joseph</a>, refers to Benjamin as the righteous youngest son of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a>. Islamic tradition, however, does not provide much detail regarding Benjamin's life and refers to him as being born from Jacob's wife <a href="Rachel">Rachel</a>, and further links a connection, as does Jewish tradition, between the names of Benjamin's children and Joseph.

Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe, that of "Joseph". According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.

The description of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars to refer to the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan. A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the "Joseph tribes" (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> <a href="the%20Exodus">and returned</a>, while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> throughout.

According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to <a href="Laban%20%28Bible%29">Laban</a> to obtain a wife originated as a <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from Egypt. According to textual scholars, the <a href="Jahwist">Jahwist</a> version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal <a href="matriarch">matriarch</a>s whatsoever.

According to , Benjamin had ten sons: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. The name of his wife/wives are not given. Classical rabbinical tradition adds that each son's name honors Joseph:

Black Sabbath

Black Sabbath were an English <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band, formed in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in 1968, by guitarist and main songwriter <a href="Tony%20Iommi">Tony Iommi</a>, bassist and main lyricist <a href="Geezer%20Butler">Geezer Butler</a>, singer <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, and drummer <a href="Bill%20Ward%20%28musician%29">Bill Ward</a>. Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a>. The band helped define the genre with releases such as "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28album%29">Black Sabbath</a>" (1970), "<a href="Paranoid%20%28album%29">Paranoid</a>" (1970) and "<a href="Master%20of%20Reality">Master of Reality</a>" (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history. 

Formed in 1968 as the Polka Tulk Blues Band, a blues rock band, the group went through line up changes, renamed themselves as Earth, broke up and reformed. By 1969, they had named themselves Black Sabbath after the film "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28film%29">Black Sabbath</a>" starring <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>, and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in <a href="Workington">Workington</a>. Signing to <a href="Philips%20Records">Philips Records</a> in November 1969, they released their first single, "<a href="Evil%20Woman%20%28Crow%20song%29">Evil Woman</a>" in January 1970.

Though receiving a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success and reached number 8 in the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, so the band returned to the studios to quickly record the follow up, "<a href="Paranoid%20%28album%29">Paranoid</a>", which was also released in 1970. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a>", critics were starting to respond favourably. 

Osbourne's regular use of alcohol and other drugs led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a> vocalist <a href="Ronnie%20James%20Dio">Ronnie James Dio</a>.

In 1991, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a> to record "<a href="Dehumanizer">Dehumanizer</a>" (1992). The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album "<a href="Reunion%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Reunion</a>".

A year after embarking on a <a href="The%20End%20Tour">farewell tour</a>, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017, after which they broke up. Iommi has stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of new material or one-off shows under the Black Sabbath name.

They were ranked by <a href="MTV">MTV</a> as the "Greatest Metal Band" of all time, and placed second in <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock" list. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked them number 85 in their "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a> in 2005 and the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2006.

Following the break-up of their previous band <a href="Mythology%20%28UK%20band%29">Mythology</a> in 1968, guitarist <a href="Tony%20Iommi">Tony Iommi</a> and drummer <a href="Bill%20Ward%20%28musician%29">Bill Ward</a> sought to form a heavy blues rock band in <a href="Aston">Aston</a>, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist <a href="Geezer%20Butler">Geezer Butler</a> and vocalist <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: "Ozzy Zig Needs Gig – has own PA". The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused. The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan "Aker" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated) and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke. Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece. While the band was performing under the Earth title, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as "The Rebel", "Song for Jim", and "When I Came Down". The demo titled "Song for Jim" was in reference to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony. Simpson was also a trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently opened a new pub named Henry's Blues House and offered to let Earth play some gigs in his club. The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth.

In December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a>. Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones%20Rock%20and%20Roll%20Circus">The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus</a>" TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was <a href="Ian%20Anderson">Ian Anderson</a>'s way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it."

While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth. They decided to change their name again. A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28film%29">Black Sabbath</a>" starring <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a> and directed by <a href="Mario%20Bava">Mario Bava</a>. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was "strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies." Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28song%29">Black Sabbath</a>", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer <a href="Dennis%20Wheatley">Dennis Wheatley</a>, along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed. Making use of the musical <a href="tritone">tritone</a>, also known as "the Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by <a href="flower%20power">flower power</a>, <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, and <a href="hippie">hippie culture</a>. <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a> frontman <a href="Rob%20Halford">Rob Halford</a> has called the track "probably the most evil song ever written". Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.

The band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969, in <a href="Workington">Workington</a>. They were signed to <a href="Philips%20Records">Philips Records</a> in November 1969, and released their first single, "<a href="Evil%20Woman%20%28Crow%20song%29">Evil Woman</a>" (a cover of a song by the band <a href="Crow%20%28band%29">Crow</a>), recorded at <a href="Trident%20Studios">Trident Studios</a>, through Philips subsidiary <a href="Fontana%20Records">Fontana Records</a> in January 1970. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, <a href="Vertigo%20Records">Vertigo Records</a>.

Black Sabbath's first major exposure came when the band appeared on <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>'s "Top Gear" radio show in 1969, performing "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28song%29">Black Sabbath</a>", "<a href="N.I.B.">N.I.B.</a>", "Behind the Wall of Sleep", and "Sleeping Village" to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced. Although the "Evil Woman" single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer <a href="Rodger%20Bain">Rodger Bain</a>. Iommi recalls recording live: "We thought 'We have two days to do it and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff."

"<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20%28album%29">Black Sabbath</a>" was released on <a href="Friday%20the%2013th">Friday the 13th</a>, February 1970, and reached number 8 in the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. Following its US and Canadian release in May 1970 by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>, the album reached number 23 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, where it remained for over a year. The album was a commercial success but was widely panned by some critics. <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a> dismissed it in a "Rolling Stone" review as "discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch". It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure. It has since been <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified platinum</a> in both US by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) and in the UK by <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI).

To capitalise on their chart success in the US, the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after "Black Sabbath" was released. The new album was initially set to be named "War Pigs" after the song "<a href="War%20Pigs">War Pigs</a>", which was critical of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>; however, Warner changed the title of the album to "<a href="Paranoid%20%28album%29">Paranoid</a>". The album's lead-off single, "<a href="Paranoid%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20song%29">Paranoid</a>", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the [Paranoid] guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom." The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit. The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the "Paranoid" single, it made number one in the charts.

The US release was held off until January 1971, as the "Black Sabbath" album was still on the charts at the time of "Paranoid"s UK release. Black Sabbath subsequently toured the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> for the first time and played their first US show at a club called Ungano's at 210 West 70th Street in New York City. The album reached No. 12 in the US in March 1971, and would go on to sell four million copies in the US, with virtually no radio airplay. Like "Black Sabbath", the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite "Paranoid" as "one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time", which "defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history". The album was ranked at No. 131 on "Rolling Stone" magazine's list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. "Paranoid"s chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single "<a href="Iron%20Man%20%28song%29">Iron Man</a>". Although the single failed to reach the top 40, "Iron Man" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single until 1998's "Psycho Man".

In February 1971, after a one off performance at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of "Paranoid", the band were afforded more studio time, along with a "briefcase full of cash" to buy drugs. "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it."

Production completed in April 1971, in July the band released "<a href="Master%20of%20Reality">Master of Reality</a>", just six months after the US release of "Paranoid". The album reached the top ten in both the US and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months, eventually receiving platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century. "Master of Reality" contained Black Sabbath's first <a href="Acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> songs, alongside fan favourites such as "<a href="Children%20of%20the%20Grave">Children of the Grave</a>" and "<a href="Sweet%20Leaf">Sweet Leaf</a>". Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a> delivering an ambivalent review of "Master of Reality" in "Rolling Stone", describing the closing song "Children of the Grave" as "naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel – but in the tradition [of rock'n'roll] ... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it". In 2003, "Rolling Stone" would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.

Following the "Master of Reality" world tour in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: "The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think "Master of Reality" was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album."

In June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a>. The recording process was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song "Cornucopia" after "sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just ... horrible" Ward said. "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled "Snowblind" after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to "<a href="Black%20Sabbath%20Vol.%204">Black Sabbath Vol. 4</a>", with Ward stating "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".

"Black Sabbath Vol. 4" was released in September 1972, and while critics were dismissive of the album upon release, it achieved gold status in less than a month, and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million copies in the US. With more time in the studio, the album saw the band starting to experiment with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs. The song "Tomorrow's Dream" was released as a single – the band's first since "Paranoid" – but failed to chart. Following an extensive tour of the US, in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia, followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand, before moving onto mainland Europe.

Following the "Volume 4" world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the "Volume 4" album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in <a href="Bel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Bel Air</a> and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on "Volume 4" and we really got discontent" Iommi said. "Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything."

After a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented <a href="Clearwell%20Castle">Clearwell Castle</a> in <a href="Forest%20of%20Dean">The Forest of Dean</a>. "We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things, and stuff started coming out again." While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath%20%28song%29">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a>", which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on "Volume 4", new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings, and complex arrangements. <a href="Yes%20%28band%29">Yes</a> keyboardist <a href="Rick%20Wakeman">Rick Wakeman</a> was brought in as a session player, appearing on "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath">Sabbra Cadabra</a>".

In November 1973, Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a>", with Gordon Fletcher of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" calling the album "an extraordinarily gripping affair", and "nothing less than a complete success." Later reviewers such as Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a "masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection", while also displaying "a newfound sense of finesse and maturity." The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US, reaching number four on the UK charts, and number eleven in the US.

The band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the <a href="California%20Jam">California Jam</a> festival in <a href="Ontario%2C%20California">Ontario, California</a> on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a>, <a href="Eagles%20%28band%29">Eagles</a>, <a href="Emerson%2C%20Lake%20%26amp%3B%20Palmer">Emerson, Lake & Palmer</a>, <a href="Rare%20Earth%20%28band%29">Rare Earth</a>, <a href="Seals%20and%20Crofts">Seals & Crofts</a>, <a href="Black%20Oak%20Arkansas">Black Oak Arkansas</a>, and <a href="Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire">Earth, Wind & Fire</a>. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager <a href="Don%20Arden">Don Arden</a>. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the US, Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.

Black Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in <a href="Willesden">Willesden</a>, this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath". "We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album – "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath" wasn't a rock album, really." Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, "<a href="Sabotage%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Sabotage</a>" was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with "Rolling Stone" stating ""Sabotage" is not only Black Sabbath's best record since "Paranoid", it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that "the magical chemistry that made such albums as "Paranoid" and "Volume 4" so special was beginning to disintegrate".

"Sabotage" reached the top 20 in both the US and the UK, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the US, only achieving Gold certification. Although the album's only single "<a href="Am%20I%20Going%20Insane%20%28Radio%29">Am I Going Insane (Radio)</a>" failed to chart, "Sabotage" features fan favourites such as "<a href="Sabotage%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Hole in the Sky</a>", and "<a href="Symptom%20of%20the%20Universe%20%28song%29">Symptom of the Universe</a>". Black Sabbath toured in support of "Sabotage" with openers <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band, titled "<a href="We%20Sold%20Our%20Soul%20for%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll">We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll</a>". The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the US.

Black Sabbath began work for their next album at <a href="Criteria%20Studios">Criteria Studios</a> in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerry Woodruffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on "Sabotage". During the recording of "<a href="Technical%20Ecstasy">Technical Ecstasy</a>", Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians. Recording of "Technical Ecstasy" was difficult; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain. It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and (for the first time) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was "unravelling at an alarming rate". The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. "Technical Ecstasy" failed to reach the top 50 in the US, and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997. The album included "<a href="Dirty%20Women">Dirty Women</a>", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song "It's Alright". Touring in support of "Technical Ecstasy" began in November 1976, with openers <a href="Boston%20%28band%29">Boston</a> and <a href="Ted%20Nugent">Ted Nugent</a> in the US, and completed in Europe with <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> in April 1977.

In late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album, and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist <a href="Dave%20Walker">Dave Walker</a>, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> and <a href="Savoy%20Brown">Savoy Brown</a>, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song "Junior's Eyes" on the BBC Television programme "Look! Hear!" Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. "I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out." Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the "Look! Hear!" footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.

Osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick."

The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, Canada, writing and recording what would become "<a href="Never%20Say%20Die%21">Never Say Die!</a>". "It took quite a long time", Iommi said. "We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." The album featured the singles "<a href="Never%20Say%20Die%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20song%29">Never Say Die</a>" and "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>", performing "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.

Touring in support of "Never Say Die!" began in May 1978 with openers <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a>. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance "tired and uninspired", a stark contrast to the "youthful" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time. The band filmed a performance at the <a href="Hammersmith%20Odeon">Hammersmith Odeon</a> in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as "Never Say Die". The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> on 11 December.

Following the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne "was on a totally different level altogether". The band would come up with new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. "I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic."

Sharon Arden (later <a href="Sharon%20Osbourne">Sharon Osbourne</a>), daughter of Black Sabbath manager <a href="Don%20Arden">Don Arden</a>, suggested former <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a> vocalist <a href="Ronnie%20James%20Dio">Ronnie James Dio</a> to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable. Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. "They were totally different altogether", Iommi explains. "Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing "across" the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in "Iron Man". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing."

Geezer Butler temporarily left the band in September 1979 for personal reasons. According to Dio, the band initially hired <a href="Craig%20Gruber">Craig Gruber</a> (with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf) on bass to assist with writing the new album. Gruber was soon replaced by <a href="Geoff%20Nicholls">Geoff Nicholls</a> of <a href="Quartz%20%28metal%20band%29">Quartz</a>. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980, and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by <a href="Martin%20Birch">Martin Birch</a>, "<a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Heaven and Hell</a>" was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release Allmusic said the album was "one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout". "Heaven and Hell" peaked at number 9 in the UK, and number 28 in the US, the band's highest charting album since "Sabotage". The album eventually sold a million copies in the US, and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.

Black Sabbath toured the US throughout 1980 with <a href="Blue%20%C3%96yster%20Cult">Blue Öyster Cult</a> on the "Black and Blue" tour, with a show at <a href="Nassau%20Coliseum">Nassau Coliseum</a> in <a href="Uniondale%2C%20New%20York">Uniondale, New York</a> filmed and released theatrically in 1981 as "Black and Blue". On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a> with <a href="Journey%20%28band%29">Journey</a>, <a href="Cheap%20Trick">Cheap Trick</a>, and <a href="Molly%20Hatchet">Molly Hatchet</a>. The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 <a href="Day%20on%20the%20Green">Day on the Green</a> at <a href="Oakland%20Coliseum">Oakland Coliseum</a>. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled "<a href="Live%20at%20Last%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Live at Last</a>" without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the British charts, and saw the re-release of "Paranoid" as a single, which reached the top 20.

On 18 August 1980, after a show in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, Ward quit the band. "It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where "He might as well be a Martian". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a> to replace Ward.

The band completed the "Heaven and Hell" world tour in February 1981, and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album. Black Sabbath's second studio album produced by Martin Birch and featuring Ronnie James Dio as vocalist "<a href="Mob%20Rules%20%28album%29">Mob Rules</a>" was released in October 1981, to be well received by fans, but less so by the critics. "Rolling Stone" reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming ""Mob Rules" finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever". Like most of the band's earlier work, time helped to improve the opinions of the music press, a decade after its release, Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called "Mob Rules" "a magnificent record". The album was certified gold, and reached the top 20 on the UK charts. The album's title track "<a href="The%20Mob%20Rules">The Mob Rules</a>", which was recorded at <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s old house in England, also featured in the 1981 animated film "<a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28film%29">Heavy Metal</a>", although the film version is an alternate take, and differs from the album version.

Unhappy with the quality of 1980's "<a href="Live%20at%20Last%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Live at Last</a>", the band recorded another live album—titled "<a href="Live%20Evil%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Live Evil</a>"—during the "Mob Rules" world tour, across the United States in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. "Ronnie wanted more say in things," Iommi said. "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. "Live Evil" is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," Dio later said. "I refuse to listen to "Live Evil", because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".

Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">his own band</a>, and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. "Live Evil" was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne's platinum selling album "<a href="Speak%20of%20the%20Devil%20%28Ozzy%20Osbourne%20album%29">Speak of the Devil</a>".

The remaining two original members, Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, began auditioning new singers for the band's next release. <a href="Samson%20%28band%29">Samson</a>'s Nicky Moore, and <a href="Lone%20Star%20%28band%29">Lone Star</a>'s <a href="John%20Sloman">John Sloman</a> were considered and Iommi states in his autobiography that <a href="Michael%20Bolton">Michael Bolton</a> auditioned for the band. The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist <a href="Ian%20Gillan">Ian Gillan</a> to replace Ronnie James Dio in December 1982. While the project was not initially set to be called Black Sabbath, pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name. The band entered <a href="The%20Manor%20Studio">The Manor Studio</a>s in <a href="Shipton-on-Cherwell">Shipton-on-Cherwell</a>, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober <a href="Bill%20Ward%20%28musician%29">Bill Ward</a> on drums. "<a href="Born%20Again%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Born Again</a>" was panned upon release by critics. Despite the negative reception of the album, it reached number four on the UK charts, and number 39 in the US. Even a decade after its release Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album "dreadful", noting that "Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom".

Although he performed on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of the pressures of the road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. "I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake." Ward was replaced by former <a href="Electric%20Light%20Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> drummer <a href="Bev%20Bevan">Bev Bevan</a> for the <a href="Born%20Again%20Tour%201983">"Born Again" '83 -'84 world tour</a>, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>, and later in the US with <a href="Quiet%20Riot">Quiet Riot</a> and <a href="Night%20Ranger">Night Ranger</a>. The band headlined the 1983 <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading Festival</a> in England, adding the Deep Purple song "<a href="Smoke%20on%20the%20Water">Smoke on the Water</a>" to their set list.

The <a href="Born%20Again%20Tour%201983">tour in support of "Born Again"</a> included a giant set of the <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> monument. In a move that would be later parodied in the mockumentary "<a href="This%20Is%20Spinal%20Tap">This Is Spinal Tap</a>", the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. As Geezer Butler later explained:

Following the completion of the <a href="Born%20Again%20Tour%201983">"Born Again" tour</a> in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like "hired help" by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named <a href="David%20Donato">David Donato</a>. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. "When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me", Butler later said. "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it."

Following Butler's exit, sole remaining original member Tony Iommi put Black Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist <a href="Geoff%20Nicholls">Geoff Nicholls</a>. While working on new material, the original Black Sabbath line-up were offered a spot at <a href="Bob%20Geldof">Bob Geldof</a>'s <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a> benefit concert; the band agreed, performing at the <a href="Live%20Aid%23JFK%20Stadium">Philadelphia</a> show, on 13 July 1985. The event marked the first time the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978, and also featured reunions of <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a> and <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>. Returning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist <a href="Dave%20Spitz">Dave Spitz</a>, drummer <a href="Eric%20Singer">Eric Singer</a> and initially intended to use multiple singers, including <a href="Rob%20Halford">Rob Halford</a> of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and <a href="Trapeze%20%28band%29">Trapeze</a> vocalist <a href="Glenn%20Hughes">Glenn Hughes</a>, and former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted. "We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album."

The band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become "<a href="Seventh%20Star">Seventh Star</a>". Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, <a href="Don%20Arden">Don Arden</a>, the two compromised and released the album as "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" in January 1986. "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, "because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." "Seventh Star", which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s <a href="Sunset%20Strip">Sunset Strip</a> hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album "often misunderstood and underrated".

The new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Black Sabbath name. "I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker", Hughes said. "The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me "whatsoever". Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a> singing in <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>. It wasn't gonna work". Just four days before the start of the tour, vocalist Glenn Hughes got into a bar fight with the band's production manager John Downing which splintered the singer's <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbital bone</a>. The injury interfered with Hughes' ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist <a href="Ray%20Gillen">Ray Gillen</a> to continue the tour with <a href="W.A.S.P.">W.A.S.P.</a> and <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>, although nearly half of the US dates would eventually be cancelled because of poor ticket sales.

One vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former <a href="Joshua%20%28band%29">Joshua</a> frontman, <a href="Jeff%20Fenholt">Jeff Fenholt</a>. Fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never confirmed this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book "Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath".

Black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at <a href="Associated%20Independent%20Recording">Air Studios</a> in <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> with producer <a href="Jeff%20Glixman">Jeff Glixman</a>. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer <a href="Vic%20Coppersmith-Heaven">Vic Coppersmith-Heaven</a>. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over "personal issues", and former <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a> and <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> bassist <a href="Bob%20Daisley">Bob Daisley</a> was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join <a href="Gary%20Moore">Gary Moore</a>'s backing band, taking drummer <a href="Eric%20Singer">Eric Singer</a> with him. After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer <a href="Chris%20Tsangarides">Chris Tsangarides</a>. While working in the UK, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form <a href="Blue%20Murder%20%28band%29">Blue Murder</a> with <a href="John%20Sykes">John Sykes</a>. The band enlisted former Alliance vocalist <a href="Tony%20Martin%20%28British%20singer%29">Tony Martin</a> to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former <a href="Electric%20Light%20Orchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> drummer <a href="Bev%20Bevan">Bev Bevan</a> to complete a few percussion overdubs. Before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at <a href="Sun%20City%2C%20North%20West">Sun City</a>, South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with <a href="Artists%20United%20Against%20Apartheid">Artists United Against Apartheid</a>, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985. Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by <a href="Terry%20Chimes">Terry Chimes</a>, formerly of <a href="the%20Clash">the Clash</a>.

After nearly a year in production, "<a href="The%20Eternal%20Idol">The Eternal Idol</a>" was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that "Martin's powerful voice added new fire" to the band, and the album contained "some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years." "Blender" gave the album two stars, claiming the album was "Black Sabbath in name only". The album would stall at No. 66 in the UK, while peaking at 168 in the US. The band toured in support of "Eternal Idol" in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. Unfortunately, in part because of a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled. Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour, and was replaced by <a href="Jo%20Burt">Jo Burt</a>, formerly of Virginia Wolf.

Following the poor commercial performance of "The Eternal Idol", Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with <a href="I.R.S.%20Records">I.R.S. Records</a>. The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with "Eternal Idol", Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. "It was a completely new start", Iommi said. "I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again". Iommi enlisted former <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a> drummer <a href="Cozy%20Powell">Cozy Powell</a>, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist <a href="Laurence%20Cottle">Laurence Cottle</a>, and rented a "very cheap studio in England".

Black Sabbath released "<a href="Headless%20Cross">Headless Cross</a>" in April 1989, and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers, although Allmusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it "the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album". Anchored by the number 62 charting single "Headless Cross", the album reached number 31 on the UK charts, and number 115 in the US. <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> guitarist <a href="Brian%20May">Brian May</a>, a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song "When Death Calls". Following the album's release the band added touring bassist <a href="Neil%20Murray%20%28British%20musician%29">Neil Murray</a>, formerly of <a href="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>, <a href="Gary%20Moore">Gary Moore</a>'s backing band, and <a href="Vow%20Wow">Vow Wow</a>.

The unsuccessful "Headless Cross" US tour began in May 1989 with openers <a href="Kingdom%20Come%20%28band%29">Kingdom Come</a> and <a href="Silent%20Rage">Silent Rage</a>, but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows. The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with <a href="Girlschool">Girlschool</a>. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.

The band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record "<a href="Tyr%20%28album%29">Tyr</a>", the follow-up to "Headless Cross". While not technically a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>, some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. "Tyr" was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the "Billboard" 200 in the US. The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with Allmusic noting that the band "mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis", while "Blender" gave the album just one star, claiming that "Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection". The band toured in support of "Tyr" with <a href="Circus%20of%20Power">Circus of Power</a> in Europe, but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales. For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include US dates.

While on his own "<a href="Lock%20Up%20the%20Wolves">Lock Up the Wolves</a>" US tour in August 1990, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined on stage at the <a href="Roy%20Wilkins%20Auditorium">Roy Wilkins Auditorium</a> by former Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler to perform "Neon Knights". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Black Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. "I do regret that in a lot of ways", Iommi said. "We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had".

Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and <a href="Cozy%20Powell">Cozy Powell</a> in autumn of 1990 to begin working on the next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a>, reuniting the "Mob Rules" era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer <a href="Reinhold%20Mack">Reinhold Mack</a>. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. ""Dehumanizer" took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album".

The resulting album, "<a href="Dehumanizer">Dehumanizer</a>" was released on 22 June 1992. In the US, the album was released on 30 June 1992 by <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, as Ronnie James Dio and his <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">namesake band</a> were still under contract with the label at the time. While the album received mixed it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade. Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single "TV Crimes", the album peaked at number 44 on the "Billboard 200." The album also featured the song "Time Machine", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film "<a href="Wayne%27s%20World%20%28film%29">Wayne's World</a>". Additionally, the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the "real" Black Sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum.

Black Sabbath began touring in support of "Dehumanizer" in July 1992 with <a href="Testament%20%28band%29">Testament</a>, <a href="Danzig%20%28band%29">Danzig</a>, <a href="Prong%20%28band%29">Prong</a>, and <a href="Exodus%20%28band%29">Exodus</a>. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Black Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his "<a href="No%20More%20Tears">No More Tours</a>" tour in <a href="Costa%20Mesa%2C%20California">Costa Mesa, California</a>. The band agreed, aside from vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who told Iommi in no uncertain terms "I'm not doing that. I'm not supporting a clown." Dio spoke of the situation in an interview years later:

Dio quit Black Sabbath following a show in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland, California</a> on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist <a href="Rob%20Halford">Rob Halford</a> stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band. Iommi and Butler also joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's "<a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a>" concert, performing a brief set of Black Sabbath songs.

Drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a> left the band following the reunion show to join Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's "<a href="Strange%20Highways">Strange Highways</a>" and "<a href="Angry%20Machines">Angry Machines</a>". Iommi and Butler enlisted former <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a> drummer <a href="Bobby%20Rondinelli">Bobby Rondinelli</a>, and reinstated former vocalist <a href="Tony%20Martin%20%28British%20singer%29">Tony Martin</a>. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains:

Under pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, "<a href="Cross%20Purposes">Cross Purposes</a>", on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with "Blender" giving the album two stars, calling <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>'s 1994 album "<a href="Superunknown">Superunknown</a>" "a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler". Allmusic's Bradley Torreano called "Cross Purposes" "the first album since "Born Again" that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record". The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the "Billboard" 200 in the US. "Cross Purposes" contained the song "Evil Eye", which was co-written by <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> guitarist <a href="Eddie%20Van%20Halen">Eddie Van Halen</a>, although uncredited because of record label restrictions. Touring in support of "Cross Purposes" began in February with <a href="Morbid%20Angel">Morbid Angel</a> and <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a> in the US. The band filmed a live performance at the <a href="Hammersmith%20Apollo">Hammersmith Apollo</a> on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled "<a href="Cross%20Purposes%20Live">Cross Purposes Live</a>". After the European tour with <a href="Cathedral%20%28band%29">Cathedral</a> and <a href="Godspeed%20%28band%29">Godspeed</a> in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America.

Following the touring cycle for "Cross Purposes", bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called <a href="GZR">GZR</a>, and released "<a href="Plastic%20Planet">Plastic Planet</a>" in 1995. The album contained the song "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: "You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone" ("I heard it's something about me ..." said Iommi. "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really paid any attention to the lyrics ... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend."

Following Butler's departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the "Tyr" line-up. The band enlisted <a href="Body%20Count">Body Count</a> guitarist <a href="Ernie%20C">Ernie C</a> to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on "Illusion of Power" by Body Count vocalist <a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a>. The resulting "<a href="Forbidden%20%28album%29">Forbidden</a>" was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the US or the UK. The album was widely panned by critics; Allmusic's Bradley Torreano said "with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan"; while "Blender" magazine called "Forbidden" "an embarrassment ... the band's worst album".

Black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Motörhead and <a href="Tiamat">Tiamat</a>, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer <a href="Bobby%20Rondinelli">Bobby Rondinelli</a>. "The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters ..." Iommi told Sabbath fanzine "Southern Cross". "That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with."

After completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist <a href="Glenn%20Hughes">Glenn Hughes</a>, and former Judas Priest drummer <a href="Dave%20Holland%20%28drummer%29">Dave Holland</a>. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called "Eighth Star" surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as "<a href="The%201996%20DEP%20Sessions">The 1996 DEP Sessions</a>", with Holland's drums re-recorded by session drummer <a href="Jimmy%20Copley">Jimmy Copley</a>.

In 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. Records. Martin later recalled "Forbidden" as a "filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn't privy to that information at the time". <a href="I.R.S.%20Records">I.R.S. Records</a> released a <a href="compilation%20album">compilation album</a> in 1996 to fulfill the band's contract, titled "<a href="The%20Sabbath%20Stones">The Sabbath Stones</a>", which featured songs from "Born Again" to "Forbidden".

In the summer of 1997, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Ozzy Osbourne officially reunited to co-headline the <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a> festival tour alongside <a href="Blizzard%20of%20Ozz">Osbourne's solo band</a>. The line-up featured Osbourne's drummer <a href="Mike%20Bordin">Mike Bordin</a> filling in for Ward, who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project, the Bill Ward Band. In December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original four members since Osbourne's 1992 "retirement show". The original line-up recorded two shows at the <a href="National%20Exhibition%20Centre">Birmingham NEC</a>, which were released as the double live album "<a href="Reunion%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Reunion</a>" on 20 October 1998. "Reunion" reached number eleven on the "Billboard" 200, and went platinum in the US. The album spawned the single "<a href="Iron%20Man%20%28song%29">Iron Man</a>", which won Black Sabbath their first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in 2000 for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a>, 30 years after the song was originally released. "Reunion" also featured two new studio tracks, "Psycho Man" and "Selling My Soul", both of which cracked the top 20 on the "Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks" chart.

Shortly before the band embarked on a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a>. Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a>, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour. Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, "<a href="Iommi%20%28album%29">Iommi</a>", in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, "<a href="Down%20to%20Earth%20%28Ozzy%20Osbourne%20album%29">Down to Earth</a>".

Black Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> in the spring of 2001, but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer of 2001. "It just came to an end", Iommi said. "We didn't go any further, and it's a shame because [the songs] were really Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all of the band members together to work on material:

In March 2002, Ozzy Osbourne's <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a> winning reality TV show "<a href="The%20Osbournes">The Osbournes</a>" debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit. The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band's back catalogue label, <a href="Sanctuary%20Records">Sanctuary Records</a> released a double live album "<a href="Past%20Lives%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Past Lives</a>", which featured concert material recorded in the 1970s, including the previously unofficial "<a href="Live%20at%20Last%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Live at Last</a>" album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005. In November 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the <a href="UK%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">UK Music Hall of Fame</a>, and in March 2006, after eleven years of eligibility, the band were inducted into the US <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. At the awards ceremony <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> played two Black Sabbath songs, "<a href="Sabotage%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Hole in the Sky</a>" and "<a href="Iron%20Man%20%28song%29">Iron Man</a>" in tribute to the band.

While Ozzy Osbourne was working on <a href="Black%20Rain%20%28Ozzy%20Osbourne%20album%29">new solo album</a> material in 2006, <a href="Rhino%20Entertainment">Rhino Records</a> released "", a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. "The Dio Years" was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the "Billboard" 200, while the single "The Devil Cried" reached number 37 on the "Mainstream Rock Tracks" chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the "Heaven and Hell" era line-up for a <a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%202007%20Tour">world tour</a>. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again."
Ward was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with "a couple of the band members". He was replaced by former drummer <a href="Vinny%20Appice">Vinny Appice</a>, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the "Mob Rules" and "Dehumanizer" albums.

Heaven & Hell toured the US with openers <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a> and <a href="Machine%20Head%20%28band%29">Machine Head</a>, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled "<a href="Live%20from%20Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Live from Radio City Music Hall</a>". In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year. In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the <a href="Metal%20Masters%20Tour">Metal Masters Tour</a>, alongside Judas Priest, Motörhead and <a href="Testament%20%28band%29">Testament</a>. The box set, "<a href="The%20Rules%20of%20Hell">The Rules of Hell</a>", featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the name of their debut studio album, "<a href="The%20Devil%20You%20Know%20%28Heaven%20%26amp%3B%20Hell%20album%29">The Devil You Know</a>", released on 28 April.

On 26 May 2009 Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.

In March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate <a href="Record%20Store%20Day">Record Store Day</a>. It was released on 17 April 2010.

Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer. In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.

In a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography "<a href="I%20Am%20Ozzy">I Am Ozzy</a>", Osbourne stated that although he would not rule it out, he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: "I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine." In July, Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band. However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.

On 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012. Guitarist Iommi was diagnosed with <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> on 9 January 2012, which forced the band to cancel all but two shows (<a href="Download%20Festival">Download Festival</a>, and <a href="Lollapalooza%20Festival">Lollapalooza Festival</a>) of a previously booked European tour. It was later announced that an intimate show would be played in their hometown <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. It was the first concert since the reunion and the only indoors concerts that year. In February 2012, drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band's reunion until he was offered a "signable contract".

On 21 May 2012, at the <a href="O2%20Academy%20Birmingham">O2 Academy</a> in Birmingham, Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005, with <a href="Tommy%20Clufetos">Tommy Clufetos</a> playing the drums. In June, they performed at Download Festival, followed by the last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago. Later that month, the band started recording an album.

On 13 January 2013, the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title "<a href="13%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">13</a>". <a href="Brad%20Wilk">Brad Wilk</a> of <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> was chosen as the drummer, and <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> was chosen as the producer. <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">Mixing</a> of the album commenced in February. On 12 April 2013, the band released the album's track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks.

The band's first single from "13", "<a href="God%20Is%20Dead%3F">God Is Dead?</a>", was released on 19 April 2013. On 20 April 2013, Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia/New Zealand tour in 40 years, to be followed by a major North American Tour in Summer 2013. The second single of the album, "End of the Beginning", debuted on 15 May in a "" episode, where all three members appeared. In June 2013, "13" topped both the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. "God Is Dead?" earned Black Sabbath their first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> in 14 years for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> in 2014.

In July 2013, Black Sabbath embarked on a North American Tour (for the first time since July 2001), followed by a Latin American tour in October 2013. In November 2013, the band started their European tour which lasted until December 2013. In March and April 2014, they made 12 stops in North America (mostly in Canada) as the second leg of their North American Tour before embarking in June 2014 on the second leg of their European tour, which ended with a concert at London's Hyde Park.

On 29 September 2014, Osbourne told "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" that Black Sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>, followed by a final tour in 2016. In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans "could change", and added, "We all live in different countries and some of them want to work and some of them don't want to, I believe. But we are going to do another tour together."

On 3 September 2015, it was announced that Black Sabbath would embark on their final tour, titled <a href="The%20End%20Tour">The End</a>, from January 2016 to February 2017. Numerous dates and locations across the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand were announced. The final shows of The End tour took place at the <a href="Genting%20Arena">Genting Arena</a> in their home city of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England on 2 and 4 February 2017.

On 26 October 2015, it was announced the band consisting of Osbourne, Iommi and Butler would be returning to the <a href="Download%20Festival">Download Festival</a> on 11 June 2016. Despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour, Osbourne stated that there would not be another Black Sabbath studio album. However, an 8-track CD entitled "<a href="The%20End%20%28EP%29">The End</a>" was sold at dates on the tour. Along with some live recordings, the CD includes four unused tracks from the "13" sessions.

On 4 March 2016, Iommi discussed future re-releases of the <a href="Tony%20Martin%20%28British%20singer%29">Tony Martin</a>-era catalogue. He explained: "We've held back on the reissues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with Ozzy Osbourne, but they will certainly be happening... I'd like to do a couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I'll also be looking at working on "<a href="Cross%20Purposes">Cross Purposes</a>" and "<a href="Forbidden%20%28album%29">Forbidden</a>"." Martin has suggested that this could coincide with the 30th anniversary of "<a href="The%20Eternal%20Idol">The Eternal Idol</a>", in 2017. In an interview that August, Martin added "[Iommi] still has his cancer issues of course and that may well stop it all from happening but if he wants to do something I am ready." On 10 August 2016, Iommi revealed that his cancer was in remission.

Asked in November 2016 about his plans after Black Sabbath's final tour, Iommi replied, "I'll be doing some writing. Maybe I'll be doing something with the guys, maybe in the studio, but no touring." The band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham. The final song was streamed live on the band's <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow. Iommi has said that he does not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, "I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know if that would happen." In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to "13", but added that, "the tour got in the way."

On 7 March 2017, Black Sabbath announced they had disbanded, through posts made on their official social media accounts.

Black Sabbath were a <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band, whose music has also been described as <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>, and <a href="acid%20rock">acid rock</a>. The band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including <a href="stoner%20rock">stoner rock</a>, <a href="grunge">grunge</a>, <a href="doom%20metal">doom metal</a>, and <a href="sludge%20metal">sludge metal</a>.

Early on Black Sabbath were influenced by <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>, <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>, <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>, <a href="The%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="John%20Mayall%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Bluesbreakers">John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a>.

Although Black Sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music, often making use of the musical <a href="tritone">tritone</a>, also called the "devil's interval". While their Ozzy-era albums such as "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a>" had slight compositional similarities to the <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> genre that was growing in popularity at the time, standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era. Much like many of their early <a href="Traditional%20heavy%20metal">heavy metal</a> contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.

As the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material: "If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said:

Beginning with their third album, "<a href="Master%20of%20Reality">Master of Reality</a>", Black Sabbath began to feature <a href="guitar%20tunings">tuned-down</a> guitars. In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to <a href="Django%20Reinhardt">Django Reinhardt</a>, a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire. Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his <a href="prosthesis">prosthesis</a>. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different <a href="dropped%20tuning">dropped tuning</a>s, including C tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E/D tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.

Black Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide, including a <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a>-certified 15 million in the US. They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. The band helped to create the genre with ground-breaking releases such as "<a href="Paranoid%20%28album%29">Paranoid</a>", an album that "Rolling Stone" magazine said "changed music forever", and called the band "<a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> of heavy metal". "Time Magazine" called "Paranoid" "the birthplace of heavy metal", placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time. "Rolling Stone" magazine ranked Black Sabbath number 85 in their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time. MTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands and <a href="VH1">VH1</a> placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. VH1 ranked Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown. Allmusic's William Ruhlmann said:

According to "Rolling Stone" Holly George-Warren, "Black Sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 70s." Although initially "despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers", the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade.

Black Sabbath have influenced many acts including <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, <a href="Korn">Korn</a>, <a href="Mayhem%20%28band%29">Mayhem</a>, <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>, <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>, <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, <a href="Body%20Count">Body Count</a>, <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>, <a href="Disturbed%20%28band%29">Disturbed</a>, <a href="Death%20%28metal%20band%29">Death</a>, <a href="Opeth">Opeth</a>, <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a>, <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>, <a href="the%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">the Smashing Pumpkins</a>, <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a>, <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a>, <a href="Fear%20Factory">Fear Factory</a>, <a href="Candlemass">Candlemass</a>, <a href="Godsmack">Godsmack</a>, and <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a>. Two gold selling <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a>s have been released, "<a href="Nativity%20in%20Black">Nativity in Black</a> Volume 1 & 2", including covers by <a href="Sepultura">Sepultura</a>, <a href="White%20Zombie%20%28band%29">White Zombie</a>, <a href="Type%20O%20Negative">Type O Negative</a>, <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a>, <a href="Machine%20Head%20%28band%29">Machine Head</a>, <a href="Primus%20%28band%29">Primus</a>, <a href="System%20of%20a%20Down">System of a Down</a>, and <a href="Monster%20Magnet">Monster Magnet</a>.

<a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>'s <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a>, who, along with bandmate <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> inducted Black Sabbath into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2006, said "Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said "Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." former <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a> guitarist <a href="Slash%20%28musician%29">Slash</a> said of the "Paranoid" album: "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension ..."Paranoid" is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off "Paranoid" or if it's off "Heaven and Hell"—it's very distinctive." <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> guitarist <a href="Scott%20Ian">Scott Ian</a> said "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums."

<a href="Lamb%20of%20God%20%28band%29">Lamb of God</a>'s <a href="Chris%20Adler">Chris Adler</a> said: "If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren't influenced by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did." Judas Priest vocalist <a href="Rob%20Halford">Rob Halford</a> commented: "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." On Black Sabbath's standing, <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> guitarist <a href="Tom%20Morello">Tom Morello</a> states: "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." <a href="Phil%20Anselmo">Phil Anselmo</a> of <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a> and <a href="Down%20%28band%29">Down</a> stated that "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".

According to <a href="Tracii%20Guns">Tracii Guns</a> of <a href="L.A.%20Guns">L.A. Guns</a> and former member of <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, the main riff of "<a href="Paradise%20City">Paradise City</a>" by <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a>, from "<a href="Appetite%20for%20Destruction">Appetite for Destruction</a>" (1987), was influenced by the song "Zero the Hero" from the "<a href="Born%20Again%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20album%29">Born Again</a>" album. <a href="King%20Diamond%20%28band%29">King Diamond</a> guitarist <a href="Andy%20LaRocque">Andy LaRocque</a> affirmed that the clean guitar part of "Sleepless Nights" from "<a href="Conspiracy%20%28King%20Diamond%20album%29">Conspiracy</a>" (1989) is inspired by Tony Iommi's playing on "<a href="Never%20Say%20Die%21">Never Say Die!</a>".

In addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres <a href="stoner%20rock">stoner rock</a>, <a href="sludge%20metal">sludge metal</a>, <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a>, <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> and <a href="doom%20metal">doom metal</a> as well as for <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> subgenre <a href="grunge">grunge</a>. According to the critic <a href="Bob%20Gulla">Bob Gulla</a>, the band's sound "shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, and <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a>".

Tony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.

Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film "<a href="Almost%20Famous">Almost Famous</a>", <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a> gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication "Trebuchet Magazine" has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.

The Bills compete in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL), as a member club of the league's <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a> (AFC) <a href="AFC%20East">East</a> division. The team plays their home games at <a href="New%20Era%20Field">New Era Field</a> in <a href="Orchard%20Park%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Orchard Park, New York</a>. The Bills are the only NFL team that plays its home games in the state of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> (the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> play at <a href="MetLife%20Stadium">MetLife Stadium</a>, located in <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford, New Jersey</a>). The Bills conduct summer training camp at <a href="St.%20John%20Fisher%20College">St. John Fisher College</a> in <a href="Pittsford%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Pittsford, New York</a>, an eastern suburb of <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>.

The Bills began play as an original franchise of the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> (AFL) in <a href="1960%20American%20Football%20League%20season">1960</a>. The club joined the NFL as a result of the <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">AFL–NFL merger</a> for the <a href="1970%20NFL%20season">1970 season</a>. The 1964 and 1965 Bills were the only teams representing Buffalo that won major league professional sports championships ("back-to-back" American Football League Championships). The Bills are the only team to win four consecutive <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">conference championships</a> and are the only NFL team to lose four consecutive <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> games. The team was owned by <a href="Ralph%20Wilson">Ralph Wilson</a> from the team's founding in 1960, until his death in 2014 at the age of 95. After his death, Wilson's estate reached an agreement to sell the team to <a href="Terrence%20Pegula">Terry</a> and <a href="Kim%20Pegula">Kim Pegula</a>, which was approved by the other NFL team owners on October 8, 2014. The Bills have the <a href="List%20of%20NFL%20franchise%20post-season%20droughts">longest active playoff drought</a> in any major professional sport: they have not qualified to play in the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">NFL playoffs</a> since 1999 and are the only team that has not appeared in the playoffs so far in the 21st century.

The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> led by head coach <a href="Buster%20Ramsey">Buster Ramsey</a> and joined the NFL as part of the <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">AFL–NFL merger</a> in 1970. The Bills won two consecutive American Football League titles in <a href="1964%20American%20Football%20League%20Championship%20Game">1964</a> and <a href="1965%20American%20Football%20League%20Championship%20Game">1965</a>, but the club has yet to win a league championship since.

Once the <a href="AFL%E2%80%93NFL%20merger">AFL–NFL merger</a> took effect, the Bills became the second NFL team to represent the city; they followed the <a href="Buffalo%20All-Americans">Buffalo All-Americans</a>, a charter member of the league. Buffalo had been left out of the league since the All-Americans (by that point renamed the Bisons) folded in 1929; the Bills were no less than the third professional non-NFL team to compete in the city before the merger, following the <a href="Buffalo%20Indians">Indians/Tigers</a> of the early 1940s and another team named the Bills in the late 1940s. Buffalo's team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946 was the Bisons.

In 1947 a contest was held to rename the team, which was owned by James Breuil of the <a href="Frontier%20Oil%20Company">Frontier Oil Company</a>. The winning entry suggested Bills, reflecting on the famous western frontiersman, <a href="Buffalo%20Bill%20Cody">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>. Carrying the "frontier" theme further, the winning contestant offered the team was being supported by Frontier Oil and was "opening a new frontier in sports in Western New York." When Buffalo joined the new American Football League in 1960, the name of the city's earlier pro football entry was adopted.

After being pushed to the brink of failure in the mid-1980s, the collapse of the <a href="United%20States%20Football%20League">United States Football League</a> and a series of high draft picks allowed the Bills to rebuild into a perennial contender in the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, a period in which the team won four consecutive <a href="AFC%20Championship%20Game">AFC Championships</a>; the team nevertheless lost all four subsequent <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>s, records in both categories that still stand.

The rise of the division rival <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> under <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a>, along with numerous failed attempts at rebuilding in the 2000s and 2010s, have prevented the Bills from reaching the playoffs since 1999, a 17-year drought that is the longest active playoff drought in all major professional sports. On October 8, 2014, <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a> owners Terry and Kim Pegula received unanimous approval to acquire the Bills during the NFL owners' meetings.

The Bills' uniforms in its first two seasons were based on those of the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> at the time.
The team's original colors were Honolulu blue, silver and white, and the helmets were silver with no striping. There was no logo on the helmet, which displayed the players' numbers on each side.

In <a href="1962%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1962</a>, the standing red bison was designated as the logo and took its place on a white helmet. In 1962, the team's colors also changed to red, white, and blue. The team switched to blue jerseys with red and white "LSU" stripes on the shoulders. the helmets were white with a red center stripe. The jerseys again saw a change in <a href="1964%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1964</a> when the shoulder stripes were replaced by a distinctive stripe pattern on the sleeves consisting of four stripes, two thicker inner stripes and two thinner outer stripes all bordered by red piping. By <a href="1965%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1965</a>, red and blue center stripes were put on the helmets.

The Bills introduced blue pants worn with the white jerseys in <a href="1973%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1973</a>, the last year of the standing buffalo helmet. The blue pants remained through <a href="1985%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1985</a>. The face mask on the helmet was blue from <a href="1974%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1974</a> through <a href="1986%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1986</a> before changing to white.

The standing bison logo was replaced by a blue charging one with a red slanting stripe streaming from its horn. The newer emblem, which is still the primary one used by the franchise, was designed by aerospace designer Stevens Wright in 1974.

In <a href="1984%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1984</a>, the helmet's background color was changed from white to red, primarily to help Bills quarterback <a href="Joe%20Ferguson">Joe Ferguson</a> distinguish them more readily from three of their division rivals at that time, the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a>, the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a>, and the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, who all also wore white helmets at that point. Ferguson said "Everyone we played had white helmets at that time. Our new head coach Kay Stephenson just wanted to get more of a contrast on the field that may help spot a receiver down the field." (The Patriots now use a silver helmet, the Colts have since been realigned to the <a href="AFC%20South">AFC South</a>, and the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>, who switched to green helmets after the <a href="1977%20New%20York%20Jets%20season">1977 season</a>, have since switched back to white helmets.)

In <a href="2002%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2002</a>, under the direction of general manager <a href="Tom%20Donahoe">Tom Donahoe</a>, the Bills' uniforms went through radical changes. A darker shade of blue was introduced as the main jersey color, and nickel gray was introduced as an accent color. Both the blue and white jerseys featured red side panels. The white jerseys included a dark blue shoulder yoke and royal blue numbers. The helmet remained primarily red with one navy blue, two nickel, two royal blue, two white stripes, and white face mask. A new logo, a stylized "B" consisting of two bullets and a more detailed buffalo head on top, was proposed and had been released (it can be seen on a few baseball caps that were released for sale), but fan backlash led to the team retaining the running bison logo. The helmet logo adopted in 1974—a charging royal blue bison, with a red streak, white horn and eyeball—remained unchanged.

In <a href="2005%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2005</a>, the Bills revived the standing bison helmet and uniform of the mid-1960s as a throwback uniform.

The Bills usually wore the all-blue combination at home and the all-white combination on the road when not wearing the throwback uniforms. They stopped wearing blue-on-white after <a href="2006%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2006</a>, while the white-on-blue was not worn after <a href="2007%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2007</a>.

For the <a href="2011%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">2011 season</a>, the Bills unveiled a new uniform design, an updated rendition of the 1975–83 design. This change includes a return to the white helmets with "charging buffalo" logo, and a return to <a href="royal%20blue">royal blue</a> instead of <a href="Navy%20blue">navy</a>.

Buffalo sporadically wore white at home in the 1980s, but stopped doing so before their Super Bowl years. On November 6, 2011, against the New York Jets, the Bills wore white at home for the first time since <a href="1986%20Buffalo%20Bills%20season">1986</a>. Since 2011, the Bills have worn white for a home game either with their primary uniform or a throwback set.

The Bills' uniform received minor alterations as part of the league's new uniform contract with <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>. The new Nike uniform was unveiled on April 3, 2012.

On November 12, 2015, the Bills and the New York Jets became the first two teams to participate in the NFL's Color Rush uniform initiative, with Buffalo wearing an all-red combination for the first time in team history.

A notable use of the Bills' uniforms outside of football will be in the <a href="2018%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, when the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">United States men's national junior ice hockey team</a> will use Bills uniforms in their <a href="list%20of%20outdoor%20ice%20hockey%20games">outdoor game</a> against <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> on December 29, 2017.

The Bills have rivalries with their three <a href="AFC%20East">AFC East</a> opponents, and also have had occasional or historical rivalries with other teams such as the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts</a> (a former divisional rival), <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, <a href="Tennesee%20Titans">Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans</a>, <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, and <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>. They also play an annual preseason game against the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a>.

This is often considered Buffalo's most famous rivalry. Though the Bills and Dolphins both originated in the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a>, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills were one of the original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent. Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of <a href="Jim%20Kelly">Jim Kelly</a> as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback <a href="Dan%20Marino">Dan Marino</a> shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino and the rise of the Belichick/Brady-led Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in a recent poll of Buffalo's primary rival. Miami leads the overall series 60-45-1, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3-1.

The rivalry first started when both teams were original franchises in the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> prior to the NFL-AFL merger. After the rise of head coach <a href="Bill%20Belichick">Bill Belichick</a> and quarterback <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a> in New England, the Patriots have dominated the AFC East, including the Bills. The Bills-Patriots rivalry has particularly become lopsided as the Patriots are 29-5 against the Bills since Belichick became head coach. This has led many fans and players in the 2000s and beyond to replace the Dolphins with the Patriots as Buffalo's most hated rival. Overall, the Patriots lead the series 70-43-1 as of 2016.

The rivalry is also notable as numerous players, including <a href="Drew%20Bledsoe">Drew Bledsoe</a>, <a href="Doug%20Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>, <a href="Lawyer%20Milloy">Lawyer Milloy</a>, <a href="Brandon%20Spikes">Brandon Spikes</a>, <a href="Scott%20Chandler%20%28American%20football%29">Scott Chandler</a> and <a href="Stephon%20Gilmore">Stephon Gilmore</a> have played for both teams at some point in their careers.

The Bills and Jets both represent the state of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, though the Jets actually play their games in <a href="East%20Rutherford%2C%20New%20Jersey">East Rutherford, New Jersey</a>. The rivalry started as the Bills and Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">Upstate New York</a>, it is not as intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging respect for each other when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach <a href="Rex%20Ryan">Rex Ryan</a> became head coach of the Bills for two seasons. Buffalo leads the series 60-53 as of 2016, including a playoff win in 1981.

The Bills and Chiefs were also original teams in the AFL and have had a long history against each other, despite never being in the same division. This rivalry heated up recently as the Bills and Chiefs met in consecutive years from 2008 to 2015, and will meet again in 2017. The teams have played three playoff games, including the AFL Championship game that determined the AFL's (later AFC) representative in <a href="Super%20Bowl%20I">the first Super Bowl</a>, with Kansas City winning and going on to face the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in the Super Bowl. Buffalo currently leads the series 25-21-1.

Though the two teams are in different divisions and did not start playing each other until after 1972, match-ups between the Bills and the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> occasionally get heated up due to the proximity and similarity between the cities of Buffalo and Cleveland. Like the Bills-Jets rivalry, the Bills and Browns often share bad luck and have had their share of ugly games. However, there have been other occasions when both teams have been competitive such as in the 1980s and most recently in 2007 and 2014. The rivalry also gained heat when former Bills safety <a href="Donte%20Whitner">Donte Whitner</a> was with the Browns. The Browns currently lead the series 12-9, including a playoff win in 1990, though the Bills have outscored the Browns in the series.

The Browns shared a rivalry with the Bills' <a href="Buffalo%20Bills%20%28AAFC%29">predecessors</a> in the <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a>, playing them twice in the AAFC playoffs before becoming one of three AAFC teams to join the NFL. The Bills were not selected to join the NFL and folded with the rest of the AAFC, leaving Buffalo without professional football until the current Bills were formed in 1959.

The Bills briefly developed a rivalry with the <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> as the two teams met in consecutive years in the Super Bowl in the 1990s.


The Buffalo Bills have retired two numbers in franchise history: No. 12 for <a href="Jim%20Kelly">Jim Kelly</a> and No. 78 for <a href="Bruce%20Smith%20%28defensive%20end%29">Bruce Smith</a>. Despite the fact that the Bills have only retired two jersey numbers in franchise history, the team has other numbers no longer issued to any player or in reduced circulation.



Since the earliest days of the team, the number 31 was not supposed to be issued to any other player. The Bills had stationery and various other team merchandise showing a running player wearing that number, and it was not supposed to represent any specific person, but the 'spirit of the team.' In the first three decades of the team's existence, the number 31 was only seen once: in 1969, when reserve running back <a href="Preston%20Ridlehuber">Preston Ridlehuber</a> damaged his number 36 jersey during a game, equipment manager Tony Marchitte gave him the number 31 jersey to wear while repairing the number 36. The number 31 was not issued again until 1990 when first round draft choice <a href="James%20Williams%20%28defensive%20back%29">James (J.D.) Williams</a> wore it for his first two seasons.

Number 15 was historically only issued sparingly after the retirement of <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>, but is apparently now in general circulation; <a href="Brandon%20Tate">Brandon Tate</a> currently wears the number.

Number 1 has also only rarely been used, for reasons never explained. Kicker <a href="Mike%20Hollis">Mike Hollis</a>, who played one season for the Bills in 2002, was the most recent to wear the number.




The <a href="Buffalo%20Bills%20Radio%20Network">Buffalo Bills Radio Network</a> is flagshipped at <a href="WGR">WGR</a>, AM 550 in Buffalo. <a href="John%20Murphy%20%28announcer%29">John Murphy</a> is the team's current <a href="Sports%20commentary">play-by-play</a> announcer; he was a <a href="color%20commentator">color commentator</a> alongside, and eventually succeeded, longtime voice <a href="Van%20Miller">Van Miller</a> after Miller's retirement at the end of the <a href="2003%20NFL%20season">2003 NFL season</a>. <a href="Mark%20Kelso">Mark Kelso</a> serves as the color analyst. The Bills radio network has approximately seventeen affiliates in <a href="upstate%20New%20York">upstate New York</a> and one affiliate, <a href="CJCL">CJCL</a> 590AM (The Fan) in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. As of early 2012, it is composed mostly of <a href="WGR">WGR</a>, Entercom's sister stations <a href="WCMF">WCMF</a> (96.5 FM) and <a href="WROC-AM">WROC-AM</a> 950 in Rochester, and a fleet of independent AM and FM stations across upstate New York from Jamestown east to Albany. Previous flagship <a href="Citadel%20Broadcasting">Citadel Broadcasting</a> was purchased by <a href="Cumulus%20Media">Cumulus Media</a>, who in turn ceased carrying Bills games at the end of the 2011 season, leaving the network without affiliates in Syracuse, Binghamton, and Erie. (The Syracuse affiliations were later picked up by <a href="Galaxy%20Communications">Galaxy Communications</a>.) Buffalo is one of ten teams contracted with <a href="Compass%20Media%20Networks">Compass Media Networks</a> to syndicate selected games nationwide.

During the preseason, most games are televised on Buffalo's <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> affiliate, <a href="WKBW-TV">WKBW-TV</a> channel 7, with several other affiliates in <a href="western%20New%20York">western New York</a>. These games are simulcast on sister stations <a href="WTVH">WTVH</a> in Syracuse, <a href="WICU-TV">WICU</a> in Erie, <a href="WHAM-TV">WHAM-TV</a> in Rochester, and for a period, <a href="CITY-TV">CITY-TV</a> in Toronto. CBS analyst and former Bills special teams player <a href="Steve%20Tasker">Steve Tasker</a> does color commentary on these games; the play-by-play position is rotated between his CBS partner <a href="Andrew%20Catalon">Andrew Catalon</a> and <a href="Rob%20Stone">Rob Stone</a>. WHAM-TV sports anchor <a href="Mike%20Catalana">Mike Catalana</a> is the sideline reporter. Since 2008, preseason games have been broadcast in <a href="High-definition%20television">high definition</a>.

Beginning in the 2016 season, as per a new rights deal which covers rights to the team as well as its sister <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">NHL</a> franchise, the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>, most team-related programming, including studio programming and the coach's show, was re-located to <a href="MSG%20Western%20New%20York">MSG Western New York</a>—a joint venture of MSG and the team ownership. Preseason games will continue to air in simulcast on WKBW.

In the event regular season games are broadcast by <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, WKBW-TV will also hold the broadcast rights to that contest, with the station having won back the rights to cable games after <a href="WBBZ-TV">WBBZ-TV</a> held the rights for 2012 and 2013.


The Bills' official mascot is <a href="Billy%20Buffalo">Billy Buffalo</a>, an eight-foot tall, anthropomorphic blue <a href="American%20bison">American bison</a> who wears the jersey "number" BB.

The Bills currently do not have <a href="National%20Football%20League%20cheerleading">cheerleaders</a>. The Bills employed the <a href="Buffalo%20Jills">Buffalo Jills</a>, an independent organization, from 1967 to 2013; the Jills suspended operations prior to the 2014 season due to legal actions. The Bills and Jills are currently involved in a legal battle, in which the Jills allege they were employees, not independent contractors, and are seeking back pay.

The Bills are one of six teams in the NFL to designate an official marching band or drumline (the others being the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>, <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a> and <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a>). Since the last game of the 2013 season, this position has been served by the Stampede Drumline, known outside of Buffalo as Downbeat Percussion. The Bills have also used the full marching bands from Attica High School, the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> at home games in recent years.

The Bills have several theme songs associated with them. One is a variation of the Isley Brothers hit "<a href="Shout%20%28The%20Isley%20Brothers%20song%29">Shout</a>", recorded by Scott Kemper, which served as the Bills' official promotional song from 1987 through 1990s. It was officially replaced circa 2000 with "The Power of the Bills", although "Shout" remains in use. The Bills' unofficial <a href="fight%20song">fight song</a>, "Go Bills", was penned by Bills head coach <a href="Marv%20Levy">Marv Levy</a> in the mid-1990s on a <a href="friendly%20political%20wager">friendly wager</a> with his players that he will write the song if the team won a particular game.

The Bills Backers are the official fan organization of the Buffalo Bills. It has over 200 chapters across North America, Europe and Oceania. Also notable is the "Bills Mafia", a collection of Bills fans organized via <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> beginning in 2010; the phrase "Bills Mafia" had by 2017 grown to unofficially represent the broad community surrounding and encompassing the team as a whole, and players who join the Bills often speak of joining the Bills Mafia. Outsiders often treat the Bills' fan base in derogatory terms, especially since the 2010s, in part because of negative press coverage of select fans' wilder antics.

The Bills are one of the favorite teams of <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> announcer <a href="Chris%20Berman">Chris Berman</a>, who picked the Bills to reach the Super Bowl nearly every year in the 1990s. Berman often uses the catchphrase "No one <a href="circle%20the%20wagons">circles the wagons</a> like the Buffalo Bills!" Berman gave the induction speech for Bills owner <a href="Ralph%20Wilson">Ralph Wilson</a> when Wilson was inducted into the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 2009.

The Bills were also the favorite team of late <a href="NBC">NBC</a> political commentator <a href="Tim%20Russert">Tim Russert</a>, a <a href="South%20Buffalo%2C%20Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">South Buffalo</a> native, who often referred to the Bills on his Sunday morning talk show, "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>". (His son, <a href="Luke%20Russert">Luke</a>, is also a notable fan of the team.) <a href="CNN">CNN</a>'s <a href="Wolf%20Blitzer">Wolf Blitzer</a>, also a Buffalo native, has proclaimed he is also a fan.

ESPN anchor <a href="Kevin%20Connors">Kevin Connors</a> is also a noted Bills fan, dating to his time attending <a href="Ithaca%20College">Ithaca College</a>. Actor <a href="Nick%20Bakay">Nick Bakay</a>, a Buffalo native, is also a well-known Bills fan; he has discussed the team in segments of <a href="NFL%20Top%2010">NFL Top 10</a>. Character actor <a href="William%20Fichtner">William Fichtner</a>, raised in <a href="Cheektowaga%2C%20New%20York">Cheektowaga</a>, is a fan, and did a commercial for the team in 2014. In 2015, Fichtner also narrated the <a href="ESPN%2030%20for%2030">ESPN 30 for 30</a> documentary on the Bills four Super Bowl appearances, "<a href="Four%20Falls%20of%20Buffalo">Four Falls of Buffalo</a>". Former Olympic swimmer <a href="Summer%20Sanders">Summer Sanders</a> has professed her fandom of the team.

Bills fans are particularly well known for their wearing of <a href="Zubaz">Zubaz</a> zebra-printed sportswear; so much is the association between Bills fans and Zubaz that when a revival of the company opened their first brick-and-mortar storefront, it chose Western New York as its first location.

Buffalo's <a href="Bills%E2%80%93Dolphins%20rivalry">rivalry</a> with the <a href="Miami%20Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> is referenced on <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a>'s 1979 album "<a href="Comedy%20Is%20Not%20Pretty%21">Comedy Is Not Pretty!</a>" on the track "How To Meet A Girl." On the track, Martin simulates chatter about football at a party, and one "partier" expresses disbelief that Buffalo could beat Miami – at the time of the album's release, the Dolphins had won 18 straight games over the Bills.

In the 1996 "<a href="The%20X-Files">X-Files</a>" episode "<a href="Musings%20of%20a%20Cigarette%20Smoking%20Man">Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man</a>", the <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">titular character</a>, a member of <a href="Syndicate%20%28The%20X-Files%29">a shadowy government cabal</a>, states that the Buffalo Bills will not win a Super Bowl while he lives.

The Buffalo Bills were featured on the direct-to-TV movie "<a href="Second%20String">Second String</a>", and in the <a href="Vincent%20Gallo">Vincent Gallo</a> drama "<a href="Buffalo%2066">Buffalo 66</a>".

Actor <a href="Dean%20Cain">Dean Cain</a> was briefly a member of the Bills. Because of this, references to the Bills have appeared in the television series "", in which Cain played <a href="Superman">the title character</a>. In the , titled "Lord of the Flys", Clark picks up a blue Buffalo Bills hat with the Charging Buffalo emblem in the center and uses it to help disguise himself. In a later episode, he lets it be known the Metropolis Mammoths are playing the Bills.

In an April 2011 episode of the television series "<a href="30%20Rock">30 Rock</a>", titled "<a href="100%20%2830%20Rock%29">100</a>", <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>'s character <a href="Jack%20Donaghy">Jack Donaghy</a> discovers that, in an alternate future, he would not only be wealthier and more successful, but he would also be the owner of a "New York football team." He later is disappointed to learn the team is not the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> or <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>, but the Buffalo Bills.

The Bills are the team that eventually unseats the Orlando Breakers, the fictional NFL team that serves as the focus of the sitcom "<a href="Coach%20%28TV%20series%29">Coach</a>" in later seasons, in the playoffs.

In a March 2014 episode of the television series "<a href="Family%20Guy">Family Guy</a>" entitled "<a href="3%20Acts%20of%20God">3 Acts of God</a>", <a href="Peter%20Griffin">Peter Griffin</a>—along with his family and friends—attends a game between the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots at <a href="Gillette%20Stadium">Gillette Stadium</a> in <a href="Foxborough%2C%20Massachusetts">Foxborough, Massachusetts</a>, which the Bills win. The episode also features Bills players <a href="Mario%20Williams">Mario Williams</a> and <a href="C.%20J.%20Spiller">C. J. Spiller</a> guest starring as themselves.

Several former Buffalo Bills players have earned a name in politics after their playing careers had ended, almost always as members of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>. The most famous of these was quarterback <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>, who was elected to <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">the U.S. House of Representatives</a> from <a href="Western%20New%20York">Western New York</a> in 1971—two years after his playing career ended and remained there for nearly two decades, serving as the Republican Party nominee for <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President of the United States</a> under <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">1996</a>.

Big Dig

The Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), known unofficially as the Big Dig, was a <a href="megaproject">megaproject</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> that rerouted the <a href="John%20F.%20Fitzgerald%20Expressway">Central Artery</a> of <a href="Interstate%2093">Interstate 93</a>, the chief <a href="highway">highway</a> through the heart of the city, into the 3.5-mile (5.6 km) <a href="Thomas%20P.%20O%27Neill%20Jr.%20Tunnel">Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel</a>. The project also included the construction of the <a href="Ted%20Williams%20Tunnel">Ted Williams Tunnel</a> (extending <a href="Interstate%2090">Interstate 90</a> to <a href="Logan%20International%20Airport">Logan International Airport</a>), the <a href="Leonard%20P.%20Zakim%20Bunker%20Hill%20Memorial%20Bridge">Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge</a> over the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a>, and the <a href="Rose%20Kennedy%20Greenway">Rose Kennedy Greenway</a> in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway. Initially, the plan was also to include a <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20Rail%20Link">rail connection</a> between Boston's two major train terminals. Planning began in 1982; the construction work was carried out between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007 when the partnership between the program manager and the <a href="Massachusetts%20Turnpike%20Authority">Massachusetts Turnpike Authority</a> ended.

The Big Dig was the most expensive highway project in the US, and was plagued by <a href="cost%20overruns">cost overruns</a>, delays, leaks, design flaws, charges of poor execution and use of substandard materials, criminal arrests, and one death. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in 1998 at an estimated cost of $2.8 billion (in 1982 dollars, US$6.0 billion adjusted for inflation ). However, the project was completed only in December 2007, at a cost of over $14.6 billion ($8.08 billion in 1982 dollars, meaning a cost overrun of about 190%) . "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" estimated that the project will ultimately cost $22 billion, including interest, and that it would not be paid off until 2038. As a result of a death, leaks, and other design flaws, <a href="Bechtel">Bechtel</a> and <a href="Parsons%20Brinckerhoff">Parsons Brinckerhoff</a>—the consortium that oversaw the project—agreed to pay $407 million in restitution, and several smaller companies agreed to pay a combined sum of approximately $51 million.

The <a href="Rose%20Fitzgerald%20Kennedy%20Greenway">Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway</a> is a roughly series of <a href="linear%20park">parks</a> and <a href="public%20space">public space</a>s, which are the final part of the Big Dig after <a href="Interstate%2093">Interstate 93</a> was put underground. The Greenway was named in honor of <a href="Kennedy%20family">Kennedy family</a> matriarch <a href="Rose%20Kennedy">Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy</a>, and was officially dedicated on July 26, 2004.

This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston's historically tangled streets, which were laid out long before the advent of the <a href="automobile">automobile</a>. As early as 1930, the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north-south through the <a href="Downtown%20Boston">downtown</a> district, in order to draw traffic off the city streets. Commissioner of Public Works <a href="William%20F.%20Callahan">William Callahan</a> promoted plans for an elevated expressway, which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. Governor <a href="John%20Volpe">John Volpe</a> interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery, putting it underground through the <a href="Dewey%20Square%20Tunnel">Dewey Square Tunnel</a>. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, "like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists)."
In 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4 km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day. Traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010.

The expressway had tight turns, an excessive number of entrances and exits, entrance ramps without merge lanes, and as the decades passed, had continually escalating vehicular traffic that was well beyond its design capacity. Local businesses again wanted relief, and city leaders sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city, and nearby residents desired removal of the matte green-painted elevated road, which mayor <a href="Thomas%20Menino">Thomas Menino</a> called Boston's "other <a href="Green%20Monster">Green Monster</a>". <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> engineers Bill Reynolds and (eventual state Secretary of Transportation) <a href="Frederick%20P.%20Salvucci">Frederick P. Salvucci</a> envisioned moving the whole expressway underground.

Another important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of <a href="Interstate%2095%20in%20Massachusetts">Interstate 95</a>, and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed <a href="Interstate%20695%20%28Massachusetts%29">Interstate 695</a>. (The law establishing the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Interstate highway system</a> was enacted in 1956.) The <a href="Inner%20Belt%20District">Inner Belt District</a> was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a> and the cities of <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline</a>, <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, and <a href="Somerville%2C%20Massachusetts">Somerville</a>. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the <a href="Massachusetts%20Turnpike">Massachusetts Turnpike</a>, particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of <a href="Brighton%2C%20Boston">Brighton</a>, and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to <a href="freeway%20and%20expressway%20revolts">massive community opposition</a> to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.

Building demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, <a href="Jamaica%20Plain">Jamaica Plain</a>, and <a href="Roslindale">Roslindale</a> led to secession threats by <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Boston">Hyde Park</a>, Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor <a href="Francis%20Sargent">Francis Sargent</a> put a moratorium on highway construction within the <a href="Massachusetts%20Route%20128">MA-128</a> corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.

With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the <a href="Southwest%20Corridor%20Park">Southwest Corridor linear park</a>, as well as a new right-of-way for the <a href="Orange%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Orange Line</a> subway and <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.

The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the <a href="Maverick%20Square">Maverick Square</a> area of <a href="East%20Boston">East Boston</a>. It was never built.

A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north–south traffic, but much east–west traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across <a href="Boston%20Harbor">Boston Harbor</a> in East Boston, and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired <a href="Callahan%20Tunnel">Callahan</a> and <a href="Sumner%20Tunnel">Sumner</a> tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston—the Massachusetts Turnpike and <a href="Storrow%20Drive">Storrow Drive</a>—mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.

A number of <a href="public%20transportation">public transportation</a> projects were included as part of an <a href="environmental%20mitigation">environmental mitigation</a> for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II <a href="Silver%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Silver Line</a> tunnel under <a href="Fort%20Point%20Channel">Fort Point Channel</a>, done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link <a href="South%20Station">South Station</a> and Logan Airport.

, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond <a href="Lechmere%20%28MBTA%20station%29">Lechmere</a>, to connect the <a href="Red%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Red</a> and <a href="Blue%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Blue</a> subway lines, and to restore the <a href="Green%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Green Line</a> streetcar service to the <a href="Forest%20Hills%20%28MBTA%20station%29">Arborway</a> in <a href="Jamaica%20Plain">Jamaica Plain</a> have not been completed. Construction of the <a href="Green%20Line%20Extension">extension beyond Lechmere</a> has begun. The Red and Blue subway line connection underwent initial design, but no funding has been designated for the project. The <a href="Green%20Line%20%26quot%3BE%26quot%3B%20Branch">Arborway Line restoration</a> has been abandoned, following a final court decision in 2011.

The original Big Dig plan also included the <a href="North-South%20Rail%20Link">North-South Rail Link</a>, which would have connected North and South Stations (the major passenger train stations in Boston), but this aspect of the project was ultimately dropped by the state transportation administration early in the <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Dukakis</a> administration. Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.

The project was conceived in the 1970s by the <a href="Boston%20Transportation%20Planning%20Review">Boston Transportation Planning Review</a> to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to <a href="Logan%20Airport">Logan Airport</a>, and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> (governor) and <a href="Fred%20Salvucci">Fred Salvucci</a> (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together—thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.

Planning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">US Congress</a>, but it was vetoed by President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> for being too expensive. When Congress <a href="Veto%20override">overrode</a> the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.

In 1997, the state legislature created the Metropolitan Highway System and transferred responsibility for the Central Artery and Tunnel "CA/T" Project from the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Governor's Office to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).
The MTA, which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.

In addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.
The downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely <a href="Land%20reclamation">landfill</a>, and included existing <a href="Red%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Red Line</a> and <a href="Blue%20Line%20%28MBTA%29">Blue Line</a> <a href="rapid%20transit">subway</a> tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.

The project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of <a href="rat">rat</a>s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing. By the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994, the process had taken some seven years, during which time inflation greatly increased the project's original cost estimates.

Reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized <a href="slurry%20wall">slurry wall</a> techniques to create concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.

The multi-lane interstate highway also had to pass under <a href="South%20Station%20%28MBTA%29">South Station</a>'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed <a href="jack%20%28device%29">jack</a> was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used <a href="ground%20freezing">ground freezing</a> (an artificial induction of <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a>) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient <a href="Earthworks%20%28engineering%29">excavation</a>, and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional <a href="Cut-and-cover%20tunnel">cut-and-cover method</a> had been applied.

Other challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.

The project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the <a href="Metropolitan%20Highway%20System">Metropolitan Highway System</a>. Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of <a href="Bechtel%20Corporation">Bechtel Corporation</a> and <a href="Parsons%20Brinckerhoff">Parsons Brinckerhoff</a>. Because of the enormous size of the project—too large for any company to undertake alone—the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included <a href="Jay%20Cashman">Jay Cashman</a>, <a href="Modern%20Continental">Modern Continental</a>, <a href="Obayashi%20Corporation">Obayashi Corporation</a>, <a href="Perini%20Building%20Company">Perini Corporation</a>, <a href="Peter%20Kiewit%20Sons%27%20Incorporated">Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated</a>, <a href="J.%20F.%20White%20Contracting%20Co.">J. F. White</a>, and the Slattery division of <a href="Skanska">Skanska</a> USA. (Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.)

The nature of the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a> crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the <a href="Tobin%20Bridge">Tobin Bridge</a> to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as "Scheme Z". This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as immediately adjacent to the Charles River.

The city of <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a> objected to the visual impact of the chosen Charles River crossing design. The city sued to revoke the project's environmental certificate and forced the project planners to redesign the river crossing again.
Swiss engineer <a href="Christian%20Menn">Christian Menn</a> took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a cradle <a href="cable-stayed%20bridge">cable-stayed bridge</a> that would carry ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the <a href="Leonard%20P.%20Zakim%20Bunker%20Hill%20Memorial%20Bridge">Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge</a>. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world, having since been surpassed by the <a href="Eastern%20span%20replacement%20of%20the%20San%20Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%20Bay%20Bridge">Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge</a>.

Meanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the "City Square Tunnel" for a <a href="Charlestown%2C%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Charlestown</a> area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the <a href="U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20Massachusetts">US Route 1</a> interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. 

Boston blue <a href="clay">clay</a> and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local <a href="landfill">landfill</a>s, fill in the <a href="Quincy%20Quarries%20Reservation">Granite Rail Quarry</a> in <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Quincy</a>, and restore the surface of <a href="Spectacle%20Island%20%28Massachusetts%29">Spectacle Island</a> in the <a href="Boston%20Harbor%20Islands%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area</a>.

The <a href="Storrow%20Drive%20Connector">Storrow Drive Connector</a>, a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to <a href="Storrow%20Drive">Storrow Drive</a> in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the <a href="Beacon%20Hill%2C%20Boston">Beacon Hill</a> neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway. The Connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for <a href="Interstate%20695%20%28Massachusetts%29">Interstate 695</a>, enabling the mainline I-93 to carry more traffic that would have used I-695 under the original Master Plan.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion. Eventual <a href="cost%20overruns">cost overruns</a> were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, <a href="James%20Kerasiotes">James Kerasiotes</a>, was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.

Several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.

At the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.

On January 17, 2002, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the <a href="Ted%20Williams%20Tunnel">Ted Williams Tunnel</a>, and onwards to Boston <a href="Logan%20International%20Airport">Logan International Airport</a>. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle">high-occupancy vehicle</a>s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath <a href="Leverett%20Circle">Leverett Circle</a> connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished <a href="Dewey%20Square%20Tunnel">Dewey Square Tunnel</a>.

By the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the <a href="North%20End%2C%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">North End</a> and in the <a href="South%20Bay%2C%20Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">South Bay</a> interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The final ramp downtown — exit 20B from <a href="Interstate%2093">I-93</a> south to <a href="Albany%20Street%20%28Boston%29">Albany Street</a> — opened January 13, 2006.

In 2006, the two Interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the <a href="Thomas%20P.%20O%27Neill%20Jr.%20Tunnel">Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel</a>, after the former <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> speaker of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> from Massachusetts who pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was required under the Federal Clean Air Act to mitigate air pollution generated by the highway improvements. Secretary of Transportation Fred Salvucci signed an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation in 1990 enumerating 14 specific projects the state agreed to build. This list was affirmed in a 1992 lawsuit settlement.

Projects which have been completed include:

As of 2014, several mitigation projects were incomplete:

Some projects, such as restoration of <a href="Green%20Line%20%26quot%3BE%26quot%3B%20Branch">Green Line "E" Arborway service</a>, were removed from the list of mitigation projects and replaced with other projects with similar air-quality improvements.

Some surface treatments, that were part of the original project plan, were dropped due to the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project. For example, the <a href="North%20Point%20Park%20%28Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts%29">North Point Park</a> was created as part of the project, but it ended without constructing pedestrian bridges to neighboring parks. The bridges were later funded by the <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a>.

While not a legally mandated requirement, <a href="public%20art">public art</a> was part of the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.

At the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former <a href="West%20End%2C%20Boston">West End</a> houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near <a href="North%20Station">North Station</a> by artist <a href="Sheila%20Levrant%20de%20Bretteville">Sheila Levrant de Bretteville</a>; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist <a href="Ross%20Miller%20%28artist%29">Ross Miller</a> in parcel 17; an historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder <a href="Donald%20McKay">Donald McKay</a> in <a href="East%20Boston">East Boston</a>; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the <a href="Millers%20River%20%28Middlesex%29">Miller's River</a> Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a>.

Extensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. 

The Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north–south I-93, several new east–west lanes became available. East–west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994–1995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004–2005, after the project was largely complete. The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004–2005 time frame. Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.

A 2008 "Boston Globe" report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of <a href="induced%20demand">demand induced</a> by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less." The "Globe" also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.

As part of the project, an elaborate Operations Control Center (OCC) <a href="control%20room">control room</a> was constructed in <a href="South%20Boston">South Boston</a>. Staffed on a "<a href="24/7/365">24/7/365</a>" basis, this center monitors and reports on <a href="traffic%20congestion">traffic congestion</a>, and responds to emergencies. Continuous <a href="video%20surveillance">video surveillance</a> is provided by hundreds of cameras, and thousands of sensors monitor traffic speed and density, <a href="air%20quality">air quality</a>, water levels, temperatures, equipment status, and other conditions inside the tunnel. The OCC can activate <a href="Ventilation%20%28firefighting%29">emergency ventilation</a> fans, change <a href="Variable-message%20sign">electronic display signs</a>, and dispatch service crews when necessary.

As far back as 2001, Turnpike Authority officials and contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems. A $10 million contract, signed off as a <a href="cost%20overrun">cost overrun</a>, was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of <a href="Modern%20Continental">Modern Continental</a> and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This information was not made public; engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.

On September 15, 2004, a major leak in the <a href="Interstate%2093">Interstate 93</a> north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted. This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on "extensive" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A "<a href="Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single section of tunnel beneath <a href="South%20Station">South Station</a>. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.

The problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive <a href="Seawater">salt water</a>. This is caused by the proximity of <a href="Boston%20Harbor">Boston Harbor</a> and the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by <a href="road%20salt">road salt</a> spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through. Salt water and <a href="salt%20spray">salt spray</a> are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any <a href="marine%20environment">marine environment</a>. It has been reported that "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing "hot spots" where water leakage is especially serious. Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded <a href="rebar">rebar</a> and other <a href="structural%20steel">structural steel</a> reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.

The much larger than expected volume of water that must be continuously pumped consumes a correspondingly larger amount of electrical power, and will cause the pumps to wear out much sooner than originally estimated.

<a href="Massachusetts%20State%20Police">Massachusetts State Police</a> searched the offices of <a href="Aggregate%20Industries">Aggregate Industries</a>, the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In March 2006 Massachusetts Attorney General <a href="Thomas%20Reilly">Tom Reilly</a> announced plans to sue project contractors and others because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints were filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state has sought approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent).

In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. In July 2007, Aggregate Industries settled the case with an agreement to pay $50 million. $42 million of the settlement went to civil cases and $8 million was paid in criminal fines. The company will provide $75 million in insurance for maintenance as well as pay $500,000 toward routine checks on areas suspected to contain substandard concrete.

A fatal accident raised safety questions and closed part of the project for most of the summer of 2006. On July 10, 2006, concrete ceiling panels and debris weighing and measuring fell on a car traveling on the two-lane ramp connecting northbound I-93 to eastbound <a href="Interstate%2090">I-90</a> in <a href="South%20Boston">South Boston</a>, killing Milena Del Valle, who was a passenger, and injuring her husband, Angel Del Valle, who was driving. Immediately following the fatal ceiling collapse, Governor <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> ordered a "stem-to-stern" safety audit conducted by the Illinois engineering firm of <a href="Wiss%2C%20Janney%2C%20Elstner%20Associates%2C%20Inc.">Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.</a> to look for additional areas of risk. Said Romney: "We simply cannot live in a setting where a project of this scale has the potential of threatening human life, as has already been seen". The collapse and closure of the tunnel greatly snarled traffic in the city. The resulting traffic jams are cited as contributing to the death of another person, a heart attack victim who died en route to Boston Medical Center when his ambulance was caught in one such traffic jam two weeks after the collapse. On September 1, 2006, one eastbound lane of the connector tunnel was re-opened to traffic.

Following extensive inspections and repairs, Interstate 90 east- and westbound lanes reopened in early January 2007. The final piece of the road network, a high occupancy vehicle lane connecting Interstate 93 north to the <a href="Ted%20Williams%20Tunnel">Ted Williams Tunnel</a>, reopened on June 1, 2007.

On July 10, 2007, after a lengthy investigation, the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> found that <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> glue used to hold the roof in place during construction was not appropriate for long-term bonding. This was determined to be the cause of the roof collapse. The Power-Fast Epoxy Adhesive used in the installation was designed for short-term loading, such as wind or earthquake loads, not long-term loading, such as the weight of a panel.

<a href="Powers%20Fasteners">Powers Fasteners</a>, the makers of the adhesive, revised their product specifications on May 15, 2007, to increase the <a href="safety%20factor">safety factor</a> from 4 to 10 for all of their epoxy products intended for use in overhead applications. The safety factor on Power-Fast Epoxy was increased from 4 to 16. On December 24, 2007, the Del Valle family announced they had reached a settlement with Powers Fasteners that would pay the family $6 million. In December 2008, Power Fasteners agreed to pay $16 million to the state to settle manslaughter charges.

Public safety workers have called the walkway safety handrails in the Big Dig tunnels "<a href="ginsu">ginsu</a> guardrails", because the squared-off edges of the support posts have caused mutilations and deaths of passengers ejected from crashed vehicles. After an eighth reported death involving the safety handrails, <a href="MassDOT">MassDOT</a> officials announced plans to cover or remove the allegedly dangerous fixtures, but only near curves or exit ramps. This partial removal of hazards has been criticized by a safety specialist, who suggests that the handrails are just as dangerous in straight sections of the tunnel.

In March 2011, it became known that senior MassDOT officials had failed to disclose an issue with the lighting fixtures in the O'Neill tunnel. In early February 2011, a maintenance crew found a fixture lying in the middle travel lane in the northbound tunnel. Assuming it to be simple <a href="road%20debris">road debris</a>, the maintenance team picked it up and brought it back to its home facility. The next day, a supervisor passing through the yard realized that the fixture was not road debris but was in fact one of the fixtures used to light the tunnel itself. Further investigation revealed that the fixture's mounting apparatus had failed, due to <a href="galvanic%20corrosion">galvanic corrosion</a> of incompatible metals, caused by having <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> in direct contact with <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>, in the presence of salt water. The <a href="electrochemical">electrochemical</a> <a href="potential%20difference">potential difference</a> between stainless steel and aluminum is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0V, depending on the exact alloys involved, and can cause considerable corrosion within months under unfavorable conditions.

After the discovery of the reason why the fixture had failed, a comprehensive inspection of the other fixtures in the tunnel revealed that numerous other fixtures were also in the same state of deterioration. Some of the worst fixtures were temporarily shored up with plastic ties. Moving forward with temporary repairs, members of the MassDOT administration team decided not to let the news of the systemic failure and repair of the fixtures be released to the public or to Governor <a href="Deval%20Patrick">Deval Patrick</a>'s administration.

, it appeared that all of the 25,000 light fixtures would have to be replaced, at an estimated cost of $54 million. The replacement work is mostly done at night, and requires lane closures or occasional closing of the entire tunnel for safety, and was estimated to take up to 2 years to complete. , replacement of the light fixtures is still ongoing.

Books of Chronicles

In the <a href="Christian%20Bible">Christian Bible</a>, the two Books of Chronicles (commonly referred to as 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, or First Chronicles and Second Chronicles) generally follow the two <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Books of Kings</a> and precede <a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a>, thus concluding the history-oriented books of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, often referred to as the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>.

In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, Chronicles is a single book, called "Diḇrê Hayyāmîm" (, "The Matters [of] the Days"), and is the final book of "<a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>", the third and last part of the "<a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>". Chronicles was divided into two books in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> and called "I and II Paralipoménōn" (, "things left on one side"). The English name comes from the Latin name "chronikon", which was given to the text by scholar <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> in the 5th century.

Chronicles present the biblical narrative from the first human being, <a href="Adam">Adam</a>, through the <a href="history%20of%20ancient%20Judah%20and%20Israel">history of ancient Judah and Israel</a> until the proclamation of King <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> (ca. 540 BC).

The Chronicles narrative begins with <a href="Adam">Adam</a> and the story is then carried forward, almost entirely by <a href="Genealogy">genealogical lists</a>, down to the founding of the first <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">Kingdom of Israel</a> (1 Chronicles 1–9). The bulk of the remainder of 1 Chronicles, after a brief account of <a href="Saul">Saul</a>, is concerned with the reign of <a href="David">David</a> (1 Chronicles 11–29). The next long section concerns David's son <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> (2 Chronicles 1–9), and the final part is concerned with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> with occasional references to the second <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">kingdom of Israel</a> (2 Chronicles 10–36). In the last chapter Judah is destroyed and the people taken into <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">exile in Babylon</a>, and in the final verses the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> king <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> conquers the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a>, and authorises the restoration of the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a>, and the return of the exiles.

Originally a single work, Chronicles was divided into two in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, a Greek translation produced in the centuries immediately preceding <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. It has three broad divisions: (1) the genealogies in chapters 1–9 of 1 Chronicles; (2) the reigns of David and Solomon, taking up the remainder of 1 Chronicles and chapters 1–9 of 2 Chronicles; and (3) the story of the divided kingdom, the remainder of 2 Chronicles.

Within this broad structure there are signs that the author has used various other devices to structure his work, notably the drawing of parallels between David and Solomon (the first becomes king, establishes the worship of Israel's God in Jerusalem, and fights the wars that will enable the Temple to be built, then Solomon becomes king, builds and dedicates the Temple, and reaps the benefits of prosperity and peace).

The last events in Chronicles take place in the reign of <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a>, the Persian king who conquered Babylon in 539 BC; this sets an earliest possible date for the book. It was probably composed between 400–250 BC, with the period 350–300 BC the most likely. The latest person mentioned in Chronicles is Anani, an eighth-generation descendant of King <a href="Jehoiachin">Jehoiachin</a> according to the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>. Anani's birth would likely have been sometime between 425 and 400 BC. The <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> gives an additional five generations in the genealogy of Anani. For those scholars who side with the Septuagint's reading, Anani's likely date of birth is a century later.

Chronicles appears to be largely the work of a single individual, with some later additions and editing. The writer was probably male, probably a <a href="Levite">Levite</a> (temple priest), and probably from Jerusalem. He was well read, a skilled editor, and a sophisticated theologian. His intention was to use Israel's past to convey religious messages to his peers, the literary and political elite of Jerusalem in the time of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>.

Jewish and Christian tradition identified this author as the 5th century BC figure <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a>, who gives his name to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezra">pageRank.Book of Ezra</a>; Ezra was also believed to be the author of both Chronicles and <a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a>, but later critical scholarship abandoned the identification with Ezra and called the anonymous author "the Chronicler". One of the most striking, although inconclusive, features of Chronicles is that its closing sentence is repeated as the opening of Ezra–Nehemiah. The last half of the 20th century saw a radical reappraisal, and many now regard it as improbable that the author of Chronicles was also the author of the narrative portions of Ezra–Nehemiah.

Much of the content of Chronicles is a repetition of material from other books of the Bible, from <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> to <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>, and so the usual scholarly view is that these books, or an early version of them, provided the author with the bulk of his material. It is, however, possible that the situation was rather more complex, and that books such as Genesis and <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Samuel">Samuel</a> should be regarded as contemporary with Chronicles, drawing on much of the same material, rather than a source for it. There is also the question of whether the author of Chronicles used sources other than those found in the Bible: if such sources existed, it would bolster the Bible's case to be regarded as a reliable history. Despite much discussion of this issue, no agreement has been reached.

The translators who created the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible (the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>) called this book "Things Left Out", indicating that they thought of it as a supplement to another work, probably Genesis-Kings, but the idea seems inappropriate, since much of Genesis-Kings has been copied almost without change. Some modern scholars proposed that Chronicles is a <a href="midrash">midrash</a>, or traditional Jewish commentary, on Genesis-Kings, but again this is not entirely accurate, since the author or authors do not comment on the older books so much as use them to create a new work. Recent suggestions have been that it was intended as a clarification of the history in Genesis-Kings, or a replacement or alternative for it.

The message which the author wished to give to his audience was this:

<doc id="4320" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4320" title="Binary search tree">
Binary search tree

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, binary search trees (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of <a href="Collection%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">container</a>: <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in <a href="computer%20memory">memory</a>. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either <a href="Set%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">dynamic sets</a> of items, or <a href="lookup%20table">lookup table</a>s that allow finding an item by its "key" (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).

Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup and other operations can use the principle of <a href="binary%20search">binary search</a>: when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, based on the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes <a href="time%20complexity">time proportional to</a> the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> of the number of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the <a href="linear%20time">linear time</a> required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding operations on <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s.

Several variants of the binary search tree have been studied in computer science; this article deals primarily with the basic type, making references to more advanced types when appropriate.

A binary search tree is a <a href="rooted%20tree">rooted</a> <a href="binary%20tree">binary tree</a>, whose internal nodes each store a key (and optionally, an associated value) and each have two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted "left" and "right". The tree additionally satisfies the binary search tree property, which states that the key in each node must be greater than or equal to any key stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree. (The leaves (final nodes) of the tree contain no key and have no structure to distinguish them from one another. Leaves are commonly represented by a special or symbol, a pointer, etc.)

Generally, the information represented by each node is a record rather than a single data element. However, for sequencing purposes, nodes are compared according to their keys rather than any part of their associated records.

The major advantage of binary search trees over other data structures is that the related <a href="sorting%20algorithm">sorting algorithm</a>s and <a href="search%20algorithm">search algorithm</a>s such as <a href="in-order%20traversal">in-order traversal</a> can be very efficient; they are also easy to code.

Binary search trees are a fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as <a href="set%20%28computer%20science%29">sets</a>, <a href="set%20%28computer%20science%29%23Multiset">multisets</a>, and <a href="associative%20array">associative array</a>s. Some of their disadvantages are as follows:


Binary search requires an order relation by which every element (item) can be compared with every other element in the sense of a <a href="total%20preorder">total preorder</a>. The part of the element which effectively takes place in the comparison is called its "key". Whether duplicates, i.e. different elements with same key, shall be allowed in the tree or not, does not depend on the order relation, but on the application only.

In the context of binary search trees a total preorder is realized most flexibly by means of a <a href="three-way%20comparison">three-way comparison</a> <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a>.

Binary search trees support three main operations: insertion of elements, deletion of elements, and lookup (checking whether a key is present).

Searching a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed <a href="recursion%20%28computer%20science%29">recursively</a> or <a href="iteration%23Computing">iteratively</a>.

We begin by examining the <a href="tree%20%28data%20structure%29%23root%20nodes">root node</a>. If the tree is "null", the key we are searching for does not exist in the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the key is less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the key is greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the remaining subtree is "null". If the searched key is not found after a "null" subtree is reached, then the key is not present in the tree. This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm (implemented in <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>):

The same algorithm can be implemented iteratively:
These two examples rely on the order relation being a total order.

If the order relation is only a total preorder a reasonable extension of the functionality is the following: also in case of equality search down to the leaves in a direction specifiable by the user. A <a href="Tree%20sort">binary tree sort</a> equipped with such a comparison function becomes <a href="Sorting%20algorithm%23Stability">stable</a>.

Because in the worst case this algorithm must search from the root of the tree to the leaf farthest from the root, the search operation takes time proportional to the tree's "height" (see <a href="Tree%20%28data%20structure%29%23Terminology">tree terminology</a>). On average, binary search trees with nodes have height. However, in the worst case, binary search trees can have height, when the unbalanced tree resembles a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a> (<a href="binary%20Tree%23Types%20of%20binary%20trees">degenerate tree</a>).

Insertion begins as a search would begin; if the key is not equal to that of the root, we search the left or right subtrees as before. Eventually, we will reach an external node and add the new key-value pair (here encoded as a record 'newNode') as its right or left child, depending on the node's key. In other words, we examine the root and recursively insert the new node to the left subtree if its key is less than that of the root, or the right subtree if its key is greater than or equal to the root.

Here's how a typical binary search tree insertion might be performed in a binary tree in <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>:

The above "destructive" procedural variant modifies the tree in place. It uses only constant heap space (and the iterative version uses constant stack space as well), but the prior version of the tree is lost. Alternatively, as in the following <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a> example, we can reconstruct all ancestors of the inserted node; any reference to the original tree root remains valid, making the tree a <a href="persistent%20data%20structure">persistent data structure</a>:

The part that is rebuilt uses space in the average case and in the worst case.

In either version, this operation requires time proportional to the height of the tree in the worst case, which is time in the average case over all trees, but time in the worst case.

Another way to explain insertion is that in order to insert a new node in the tree, its key is first compared with that of the root. If its key is less than the root's, it is then compared with the key of the root's left child. If its key is greater, it is compared with the root's right child. This process continues, until the new node is compared with a leaf node, and then it is added as this node's right or left child, depending on its key: if the key is less than the leaf's key, then it is inserted as the leaf's left child, otherwise as the leaf's right child.

There are other ways of inserting nodes into a binary tree, but this is the only way of inserting nodes at the leaves and at the same time preserving the BST structure.

When removing a node from a binary "search" tree it is mandatory to maintain the in-order sequence of the nodes.
There are many possibilities to do this. However, the following method which has been proposed by T. Hibbard in 1962 guarantees that the heights of the subject subtrees are changed by at most one.
There are three possible cases to consider:
In all cases, when "D" happens to be the root, make the replacement node root again.

Broadly speaking, nodes with children are harder to delete. As with all binary trees, a node's in-order successor is its right subtree's left-most child, and a node's in-order predecessor is the left subtree's right-most child. In either case, this node will have only one or no child at all. Delete it according to one of the two simpler cases above.

Consistently using the in-order successor or the in-order predecessor for every instance of the two-child case can lead to an <a href="self-balancing%20binary%20search%20tree">unbalanced</a> tree, so some implementations select one or the other at different times.

Runtime analysis: Although this operation does not always traverse the tree down to a leaf, this is always a possibility; thus in the worst case it requires time proportional to the height of the tree. It does not require more even when the node has two children, since it still follows a single path and does not visit any node twice.

Once the binary search tree has been created, its elements can be retrieved <a href="in-order%20traversal">in-order</a> by <a href="recursion">recursively</a> traversing the left subtree of the root node, accessing the node itself, then recursively traversing the right subtree of the node, continuing this pattern with each node in the tree as it's recursively accessed. As with all binary trees, one may conduct a <a href="pre-order%20traversal">pre-order traversal</a> or a <a href="post-order%20traversal">post-order traversal</a>, but neither are likely to be useful for binary "search" trees. An in-order traversal of a binary search tree will always result in a sorted list of node items (numbers, strings or other comparable items).

The code for in-order traversal in Python is given below. It will call <a href="Callback%20%28computer%20programming%29">callback</a> (some function the programmer wishes to call on the node's value, such as printing to the screen) for every node in the tree.

Traversal requires time, since it must visit every node. This algorithm is also , so it is <a href="asymptotically%20optimal">asymptotically optimal</a>.

Traversal can also be implemented <a href="Iteration%23Computing">iteratively</a>. For certain applications, e.g. greater equal search, approximative search, an operation for "single step (iterative) traversal" can be very useful. This is, of course, implemented without the callback construct and takes on average and in the worst case.

Sometimes we already have a binary tree, and we need to determine whether it is a BST. This problem has a simple recursive solution.

The BST property—every node on the right subtree has to be larger than the current node and every node on the left subtree has to be smaller than (or equal to - should not be the case as only unique values should be in the tree - this also poses the question as to if such nodes should be left or right of this parent) the current node—is the key to figuring out whether a tree is a BST or not. The <a href="greedy%20algorithm">greedy algorithm</a> – simply traverse the tree, at every node check whether the node contains a value larger than the value at the left child and smaller than the value on the right child – does not work for all cases. Consider the following tree:

In the tree above, each node meets the condition that the node contains a value larger than its left child and smaller than its right child hold, and yet it is not a BST: the value 5 is on the right subtree of the node containing 20, a violation of the BST property.

Instead of making a decision based solely on the values of a node and its children, we also need information flowing down from the parent as well. In the case of the tree above, if we could remember about the node containing the value 20, we would see that the node with value 5 is violating the BST property contract.

So the condition we need to check at each node is: 

A recursive solution in C can explain this further:
node->key+1 and node->key-1 are done to allow only distinct elements in BST.

If we want same elements to also be present, then we can use only node->key in both places.
The initial call to this function can be something like this:

Essentially we keep creating a valid range (starting from [MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE]) and keep shrinking it down for each node as we go down recursively.

As pointed out in section <a href="%23Traversal">#Traversal</a>, an in-order traversal of a binary "search" tree returns the nodes sorted. Thus we only need to keep the last visited node while traversing the tree and check whether its key is smaller (or smaller/equal, if duplicates are to be allowed in the tree) compared to the current key.

Some examples shall illustrate the use of above basic building blocks.

A binary search tree can be used to implement a simple <a href="sorting%20algorithm">sorting algorithm</a>. Similar to <a href="heapsort">heapsort</a>, we insert all the values we wish to sort into a new ordered data structure—in this case a binary search tree—and then traverse it in order.

The worst-case time of codice_1 is —if you feed it a sorted list of values, it chains them into a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a> with no left subtrees. For example, codice_2 yields the tree codice_3.

There are several schemes for overcoming this flaw with simple binary trees; the most common is the <a href="self-balancing%20binary%20search%20tree">self-balancing binary search tree</a>. If this same procedure is done using such a tree, the overall worst-case time is , which is <a href="asymptotically%20optimal">asymptotically optimal</a> for a <a href="comparison%20sort">comparison sort</a>. In practice, the added overhead in time and space for a tree-based sort (particularly for node <a href="dynamic%20memory%20allocation">allocation</a>) make it inferior to other asymptotically optimal sorts such as <a href="heapsort">heapsort</a> for static list sorting. On the other hand, it is one of the most efficient methods of "incremental sorting", adding items to a list over time while keeping the list sorted at all times.

Binary search trees can serve as <a href="priority%20queue">priority queue</a>s: structures that allow insertion of arbitrary key as well as lookup and deletion of the minimum (or maximum) key. Insertion works as previously explained. "Find-min" walks the tree, following left pointers as far as it can without hitting a leaf:

"Find-max" is analogous: follow right pointers as far as possible. "Delete-min" ("max") can simply look up the minimum (maximum), then delete it. This way, insertion and deletion both take logarithmic time, just as they do in a <a href="binary%20heap">binary heap</a>, but unlike a binary heap and most other priority queue implementations, a single tree can support all of "find-min", "find-max", "delete-min" and "delete-max" at the same time, making binary search trees suitable as <a href="double-ended%20priority%20queue">double-ended priority queue</a>s.

There are many types of binary search trees. <a href="AVL%20tree">AVL tree</a>s and <a href="red-black%20tree">red-black tree</a>s are both forms of <a href="self-balancing%20binary%20search%20tree">self-balancing binary search tree</a>s. A <a href="splay%20tree">splay tree</a> is a binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements nearer to the root. In a <a href="treap">treap</a> ("tree <a href="heap%20%28data%20structure%29">heap</a>"), each node also holds a (randomly chosen) priority and the parent node has higher priority than its children. <a href="Tango%20tree">Tango tree</a>s are trees optimized for fast searches.
<a href="T-tree">T-tree</a>s are binary search trees optimized to reduce storage space overhead, widely used for in-memory databases

A degenerate tree is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one associated child node. It is unbalanced and, in the worst case, performance degrades to that of a linked list. If your add node function does not handle re-balancing, then you can easily construct a degenerate tree by feeding it with data that is already sorted. What this means is that in a performance measurement, the tree will essentially behave like a linked list data structure.

D. A. Heger (2004) presented a performance comparison of binary search trees. <a href="Treap">Treap</a> was found to have the best average performance, while <a href="red-black%20tree">red-black tree</a> was found to have the smallest amount of performance variations.

If we do not plan on modifying a search tree, and we know exactly how often each item will be accessed, we can construct an "optimal binary search tree", which is a search tree where the average cost of looking up an item (the "expected search cost") is minimized.

Even if we only have estimates of the search costs, such a system can considerably speed up lookups on average. For example, if you have a BST of English words used in a <a href="spell%20checker">spell checker</a>, you might balance the tree based on word frequency in <a href="text%20corpus">text corpora</a>, placing words like "the" near the root and words like "agerasia" near the leaves. Such a tree might be compared with <a href="Huffman%20tree">Huffman tree</a>s, which similarly seek to place frequently used items near the root in order to produce a dense information encoding; however, Huffman trees store data elements only in leaves, and these elements need not be ordered.

If we do not know the sequence in which the elements in the tree will be accessed in advance, we can use <a href="splay%20tree">splay tree</a>s which are asymptotically as good as any static search tree we can construct for any particular sequence of lookup operations.

"Alphabetic trees" are Huffman trees with the additional constraint on order, or, equivalently, search trees with the modification that all elements are stored in the leaves. Faster algorithms exist for "optimal alphabetic binary trees" (OABTs).

Binary tree

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, a binary tree is a <a href="tree%20structure">tree</a> <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a> in which each node has at most two <a href="child%20node">children</a>, which are referred to as the ' and the '. A <a href="recursive%20definition">recursive definition</a> using just <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a> notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a <a href="tuple">triple</a> ("L", "S", "R"), where "L" and "R" are binary trees or the <a href="empty%20set">empty set</a> and "S" is a <a href="singleton%20set">singleton set</a>. Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.

From a <a href="graph%20theory">graph theory</a> perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually <a href="Arborescence%20%28graph%20theory%29">arborescences</a>. A binary tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence—a term which appears in some very old programming books, before the modern computer science terminology prevailed. It is also possible to interpret a binary tree as an <a href="undirected%20graph">undirected</a>, rather than a <a href="directed%20graph">directed graph</a>, in which case a binary tree is an <a href="ordered%20tree">ordered</a>, <a href="rooted%20tree">rooted tree</a>. Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of "binary tree" to emphasize the fact that the tree is rooted, but as defined above, a binary tree is always rooted. A binary tree is a special case of an ordered <a href="K-ary%20tree">K-ary tree</a>, where "k" is 2.

In computing, binary trees are seldom used solely for their structure. Much more typical is to define a labeling function on the nodes, which associates some value to each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a>s and <a href="binary%20heap">binary heap</a>s, and are used for efficient <a href="search%20algorithm">searching</a> and <a href="Sorting%20algorithm">sorting</a>. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when there is only one child present matters in some of these applications, in particular it is significant in binary search trees. In mathematics, what is termed "binary tree" can vary significantly from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in computer science, but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.

Another way of defining a "full" binary tree is a <a href="recursive%20definition">recursive definition</a>. A full binary tree is either:
This also does not establish the order of children, but does fix a specific root node.

To actually define a binary tree in general, we must allow for the possibility that only one of the children may be empty. An artifact, which in some textbooks is called an "extended binary tree" is needed for that purpose. An extended binary tree is thus recursively defined as:

Another way of imagining this construction (and understanding the terminology) is to consider instead of the empty set a different type of node—for instance square nodes if the regular ones are circles.

A binary tree is a <a href="rooted%20tree">rooted tree</a> that is also an <a href="ordered%20tree">ordered tree</a> (a.k.a. plane tree) in which every node has at most two children. A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below. Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes possible to distinguish left child from right child. But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child.

The necessary distinction can be made by first partitioning the edges, i.e., defining the binary tree as triplet (V, E, E), where (V, E ∪ E) is a rooted tree (equivalently arborescence) and E ∩ E is empty, and also requiring that for all "j" ∈ { 1, 2 } every node has at most one E child. A more informal way of making the distinction is to say, quoting the <a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Mathematics">Encyclopedia of Mathematics</a>, that "every node has a left child, a right child, neither, or both" and to specify that these "are all different" binary trees.

Tree terminology is not well-standardized and so varies in the literature.



In <a href="combinatorics">combinatorics</a> one considers the problem of counting the number of full binary trees of a given size. Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one). The size of the tree is taken to be the number "n" of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are of them. The number of such binary trees of size "n" is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of symbols (representing leaves) separated by "n" binary operators (representing internal nodes), so as to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator. For instance for one has to parenthesize a string like , which is possible in five ways:
The correspondence to binary trees should be obvious, and the addition of redundant parentheses (around an already parenthesized expression or around the full expression) is disallowed (or at least not counted as producing a new possibility).

There is a unique binary tree of size 0 (consisting of a single leaf), and any other binary tree is characterized by the pair of its left and right children; if these have sizes "i" and "j" respectively, the full tree has size . Therefore, the number formula_15 of binary trees of size "n" has the following recursive description formula_16, and formula_17 for any positive integer "n". It follows that formula_15 is the <a href="Catalan%20number">Catalan number</a> of index "n".

The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2"n" in the <a href="Dyck%20language">Dyck language</a>, which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced. The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2"n" is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial '(' and its matching ')' together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2"i" and 2"j" satisfy ); this number is therefore also the Catalan number formula_15. So there are also five Dyck words of length 6:

These Dyck words do not correspond to binary trees in the same way. Instead, they are related by the following recursively defined bijection: the Dyck word equal to the empty string corresponds to the binary tree of size 0 with only one leaf. Any other Dyck word can be written as (formula_21)formula_22, where formula_21,formula_22 are themselves (possibly empty) Dyck words and where the two written parentheses are matched. The bijection is then defined by letting the words formula_21 and formula_22 correspond to the binary trees that are the left and right children of the root.

A bijective correspondence can also be defined as follows: enclose the Dyck word in an extra pair of parentheses, so that the result can be interpreted as a <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> list expression (with the empty list () as only occurring atom); then the <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29%23S-expressions%20represent%20lists">dotted-pair</a> expression for that proper list is a fully parenthesized expression (with NIL as symbol and '.' as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is in fact the internal representation of the proper list).

The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a <a href="free%20magma">free magma</a> on a singleton set.

Binary trees can be constructed from <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> primitives in several ways.

In a language with <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a> and <a href="reference%20%28computer%20science%29">references</a>, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child. Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent. If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special <a href="sentinel%20node">sentinel node</a>.

This method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is <a href="threaded%20binary%20tree">threaded binary tree</a>.

In languages with <a href="tagged%20union">tagged union</a>s such as <a href="ML%20%28programming%20language%29">ML</a>, a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a "leaf" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers. For example, the following line of code in <a href="OCaml">OCaml</a> (an ML dialect) defines a binary tree that stores a character in each node.

Binary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an <a href="implicit%20data%20structure">implicit data structure</a> in <a href="array%20data%20structure">arrays</a>, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space. In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index "i", its children are found at indices formula_27 (for the left child) and formula_28 (for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index "formula_29" (assuming the root has index zero). This method benefits from more compact storage and better <a href="locality%20of%20reference">locality of reference</a>, particularly during a preorder traversal. However, it is expensive to grow and wastes space proportional to 2 - "n" for a tree of depth "h" with "n" nodes.

This method of storage is often used for <a href="binary%20heap">binary heap</a>s. No space is wasted because nodes are added in breadth-first order.

A <a href="succinct%20data%20structure">succinct data structure</a> is one which occupies close to minimum possible space, as established by <a href="information%20theory">information theoretical</a> lower bounds. The number of different binary trees on formula_1 nodes is formula_31, the formula_1th <a href="Catalan%20number">Catalan number</a> (assuming we view trees with identical "structure" as identical). For large formula_1, this is about formula_34; thus we need at least about formula_35 bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy formula_36 bits.

One simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting "1" for an internal node and "0" for a leaf. <a href="http%3A//theory.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.897/spring03/scribe_notes/L12/lecture12.pdf"></a> If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder. This function accomplishes this:

The string "structure" has only formula_37 bits in the end, where formula_1 is the number of (internal) nodes; we don't even have to store its length. To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this:

More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form.

There is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> to represent general ordered trees as binary trees. To convert a general ordered tree to binary tree, we only need to represent the general tree in left-child right-sibling way. The result of this representation will automatically be a binary tree, if viewed from a different perspective. Each node "N" in the ordered tree corresponds to a node "N' " in the binary tree; the "left" child of "N' " is the node corresponding to the first child of "N", and the "right" child of "N' " is the node corresponding to "N" 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of "N". This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a <a href="left-child%20right-sibling%20binary%20tree">left-child right-sibling binary tree</a> (LCRS tree), or a <a href="doubly%20chained%20tree">doubly chained tree</a>, or a <a href="Filial-Heir%20chain">Filial-Heir chain</a>.

One way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a <a href="linked%20list">linked list</a>, chained together with their "right" fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its "left" field.

For example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}. It can be converted into the binary tree on the right.

The binary tree can be thought of as the original tree tilted sideways, with the black left edges representing "first child" and the blue right edges representing "next sibling". The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as:

which would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right, without any letters on those nodes that have a left child.

There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are <a href="mutator%20method">mutator</a> operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.

Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after a <a href="leaf%20node">leaf node</a>. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.

To add a new node after leaf node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent.

Insertion on <a href="internal%20node">internal node</a>s is slightly more complex than on leaf nodes. Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.) A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node.

Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.

Suppose that the node to delete is node A. If A has no children, deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A's parent to <a href="null%20pointer">null</a>. If A has one child, set the parent of A's child to A's parent and set the child of A's parent to A's child.

In a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously. However, in certain binary trees (including <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a>s) these nodes "can" be deleted, though with a rearrangement of the tree structure.

Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root.

In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root node that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited. Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles. Pre-order is a special case of this. See <a href="depth-first%20search">depth-first search</a> for more information.

Contrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited. See <a href="breadth-first%20search">breadth-first search</a> for more information. Also called a "level-order traversal".

In a complete binary tree, a node's breadth-index ("i" − (2 − 1)) can be used as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit "d" − 1, where "d" is the node's distance from the root ("d" = ⌊log2("i"+1)⌋) and the node in question is not the root itself ("d" > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit "d" − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating a complete binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.

Borel measure

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, specifically in <a href="Measure%20%28mathematics%29">measure theory</a>, a Borel measure on a <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a> is a <a href="measure%20%28mathematics%29">measure</a> that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all <a href="Borel%20sets">Borel sets</a>). Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.

Let formula_1 be a <a href="locally%20compact">locally compact</a> <a href="Hausdorff%20space">Hausdorff space</a>, and let formula_2 be the <a href="Sigma-algebra%23Generated%20.CF.83-algebra">smallest σ-algebra</a> that contains the <a href="open%20set">open set</a>s of formula_1; this is known as the σ-algebra of <a href="Borel%20set">Borel set</a>s. A Borel measure is any measure formula_4 defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets. Some authors require in addition that formula_4 is locally compact, meaning that formula_6 for every <a href="compact%20set">compact set</a> formula_7. If a Borel measure formula_4 is both <a href="inner%20regular">inner regular</a> and <a href="Regular_measure%23Definition">outer regular</a>, it is called a <a href="Borel%20regular%20measure">regular Borel measure</a> (some authors also require it to be <a href="Tightness%20of%20measures">tight</a>). If formula_4 is both inner regular and <a href="Locally%20finite%20measure">locally finite</a>, it is called a <a href="Radon%20measure">Radon measure</a>.

The <a href="real%20line">real line</a> formula_10 with its <a href="Real%20line%23As%20a%20topological%20space">usual topology</a> is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, formula_11 is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of formula_10. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns formula_13 for every half-open interval formula_14 is sometimes called "the" Borel measure on formula_10. This measure turns out to be the restriction on the Borel σ-algebra of the <a href="Lebesgue%20measure">Lebesgue measure</a> formula_16, which is a <a href="complete%20measure">complete measure</a> and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra. The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the "completion" of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra which contains all the Borel sets and has a <a href="complete%20measure">complete measure</a> on it. Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., formula_17 for every Borel measurable set, where formula_4 is the Borel measure described above).

If "X" and "Y" are <a href="second-countable">second-countable</a>, <a href="Hausdorff%20topological%20space">Hausdorff topological spaces</a>, then the set of Borel subsets formula_19 of their product coincides with the product of the sets formula_20 of Borel subsets of "X" and "Y". That is, the Borel <a href="functor">functor</a> 
from the category of second-countable Hausdorff spaces to the category of <a href="Measurable%20space">measurable spaces</a> preserves finite <a href="Product%20%28category%20theory%29">products</a>.

The <a href="Lebesgue%E2%80%93Stieltjes%20integral">Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral</a> is the ordinary <a href="Lebesgue%20integral">Lebesgue integral</a> with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of <a href="bounded%20variation">bounded variation</a> on the real line. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a <a href="regular%20Borel%20measure">regular Borel measure</a>, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.

One can define the <a href="Laplace%20transform">Laplace transform</a> of a finite Borel measure μ on the <a href="real%20line">real line</a> by the <a href="Lebesgue%20integral">Lebesgue integral</a>

An important special case is where μ is a <a href="probability%20measure">probability measure</a> or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In <a href="operational%20calculus">operational calculus</a>, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a <a href="distribution%20function">distribution function</a> "f". In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes

where the lower limit of 0 is shorthand notation for

Blackadder

Blackadder is a series of four <a href="BBC%20One">BBC1</a> <a href="Period%20piece">period</a> <a href="British%20sitcom">British sitcom</a>s, along with several one-off instalments. All television episodes starred <a href="Rowan%20Atkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> as the anti-hero <a href="Edmund%20Blackadder">Edmund Blackadder</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Robinson">Tony Robinson</a> as Blackadder's <a href="dogsbody">dogsbody</a>, <a href="Baldrick">Baldrick</a>. Each series was set in a different historical period, with the two <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>s accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, for example <a href="Melchett%20%28Blackadder%29">Melchett</a> (<a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>) and <a href="Lord%20Flashheart">Lord Flashheart</a> (<a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a>).

The first series, "<a href="The%20Black%20Adder">The Black Adder</a>", was written by <a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a> and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a>. The shows were produced by <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28producer%29">John Lloyd</a>. In 2000, the fourth series, "<a href="Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Blackadder Goes Forth</a>", ranked at 16 in the "<a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>", a list created by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>. Also in the 2004 TV poll to find "<a href="Britain%27s%20Best%20Sitcom">Britain's Best Sitcom</a>", "Blackadder" was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by "<a href="Only%20Fools%20and%20Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a>". It was also ranked as the 9th-best TV show of all time by "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine.

Although each series is set in a different era, all follow the "misfortunes" of <a href="Edmund%20Blackadder">Edmund Blackadder</a> (played by Atkinson), who in each is a member of a British family dynasty present at many significant periods and places in British history. It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one (the end theme lyrics of series 2, episode "Head", specify that he is the great-grandson of the previous), although it is never specified how or when any of the Blackadders (who are usually bachelors) managed to father children.

As the generations progress, each Blackadder becomes increasingly clever and perceptive, while the family's social status steadily erodes. However, each Blackadder remains a cynical, cowardly opportunist, maintaining and increasing his own status and fortunes, regardless of his surroundings.

The life of each Blackadder is also entwined with his servant, each from the <a href="Baldrick">Baldrick</a> family line (played by <a href="Tony%20Robinson">Tony Robinson</a>). Each generation acts as the dogsbody to his respective Blackadder. They decrease in intelligence (and in personal-hygiene standards) as their masters' intellect increases. Each Blackadder and Baldrick is also saddled with tolerating the presence of a dim-witted <a href="aristocracy">aristocrat</a>. This role was taken in the first two series by <a href="Lord%20Percy%20Percy">Lord Percy Percy</a>, played by <a href="Tim%20McInnerny">Tim McInnerny</a>; with <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> playing the role in the third and fourth series, as <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29">Prince George, Prince Regent</a>; and <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29">Lieutenant George</a>, respectively.

Each series was set in a different period of <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20Isles">British history</a>, beginning in 1485 and ending in 1917, and comprised six half-hour episodes. The first series, made in 1983, was called "<a href="The%20Black%20Adder">The Black Adder</a>" and was set in the fictional reign of "<a href="Richard%20IV%20of%20England%20%28Blackadder%29">Richard IV</a>". The second series, "<a href="Blackadder%20II">Blackadder II</a>" (1986), was set during the reign of <a href="Queenie%20%28Blackadder%29">Elizabeth I</a>. "<a href="Blackadder%20the%20Third">Blackadder the Third</a>" (1987) was set during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the reign of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>, and "<a href="Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Blackadder Goes Forth</a>" (1989) was set in 1917 in the trenches of the <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a>.

"The Black Adder", the first series of "Blackadder", was written by <a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a> and <a href="Rowan%20Atkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> and produced by <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28producer%29">John Lloyd</a>. It originally aired on <a href="BBC1">BBC1</a> from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian <a href="Seven%20Network">Seven Network</a>.

Set in 1485 at the end of the <a href="Britain%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">British Middle Ages</a>, the series is written as an <a href="Counterfactual%20history">alternative history</a> in which <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">King Richard III</a> won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a> only to be mistaken for someone else and murdered, and is succeeded by <a href="Richard%20IV%20of%20England%20%28Blackadder%29">Richard IV</a> (<a href="Brian%20Blessed">Brian Blessed</a>), one of the <a href="Princes%20in%20the%20Tower">Princes in the Tower</a>. The series follows the exploits of Richard IV's unfavoured second son <a href="Prince%20Edmund%20%28Blackadder%29">Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh</a> (who calls himself "The Black Adder") in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and his eventual quest to overthrow him.

Conceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on "<a href="Not%20the%20Nine%20O%27Clock%20News">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a>", the series dealt comically with a number of medieval issues in Britain: <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, Royal succession, European relations, the <a href="Crusade">Crusade</a>s, and the conflict between the Church and the Crown. Along with the secret history, many historical events portrayed in the series were <a href="anachronism">anachronistic</a> (for example, the <a href="ninth%20crusade">last Crusade to the Holy Land</a> ended in 1291); this dramatic licence would continue in the subsequent "Blackadders". The filming of the series was highly ambitious, with a large cast and much location shooting. The series also featured <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> dialogue, often adapted for comic effect; the end credits featured the words "Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare".

"Blackadder II" is set in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> during the reign of <a href="Queenie%20%28Blackadder%29">Queen Elizabeth I</a> (1558–1603), who is portrayed by <a href="Miranda%20Richardson">Miranda Richardson</a>. The principal character is <a href="Lord%20Blackadder">Edmund, Lord Blackadder</a>, the great-grandson of the original Black Adder. During the series, he regularly deals with the <a href="British%20monarchy">Queen</a>, her obsequious <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a> <a href="List%20of%20Blackadder%20characters%23Melchett">Lord Melchett</a> (<a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>)—his rival—and the Queen's demented former nanny <a href="Nursie">Nursie</a> (<a href="Patsy%20Byrne">Patsy Byrne</a>).

Following the BBC's request for improvements (and a severe budget reduction), several changes were made. The second series was the first to establish the familiar Blackadder character: cunning, shrewd, and witty, in sharp contrast to the first series' bumbling <a href="Prince%20Edmund%20%28Blackadder%29">Prince Edmund</a>. To make the show more cost-effective, it was also shot with virtually no outdoor scenes (the first series was shot largely on location) and several frequently used indoor sets, such as the Queen's <a href="throne%20room">throne room</a> and Blackadder's front room.

A quote from this series ranked number three in a list of the top 25 television "putdowns" of the last 40 years by the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" magazine: "The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr. Brain has long since departed, hasn't he, Percy?"

"Blackadder the Third" is set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period known as the <a href="English%20Regency">Regency</a>. In the series, <a href="Mr.%20E.%20Blackadder">Edmund Blackadder</a> Esquire is the butler to the <a href="Prince%20Regent">Prince Regent</a>, the <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29">Prince of Wales</a> (the prince is played by <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> as a complete <a href="fop">fop</a> and idiot). Despite Edmund's respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently-fluctuating wage packet (as well, it seems, from stealing and selling off the Prince's socks) from the Prince: "If I'm running short of cash, all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fat-Head for a rise."

As well as Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson in their usual roles, this series starred <a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> as the <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29">Prince Regent</a>, and <a href="Helen%20Atkinson-Wood">Helen Atkinson-Wood</a> as <a href="Mrs.%20Miggins">Mrs. Miggins</a>. The series features <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Dr. Samuel Johnson</a> (<a href="Robbie%20Coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</a>), <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a> (Simon Osborne), the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (featuring <a href="Chris%20Barrie">Chris Barrie</a>, <a href="Nigel%20Planer">Nigel Planer</a> and <a href="Tim%20McInnerny">Tim McInnerny</a> as <a href="the%20Scarlet%20Pimpernel">the Scarlet Pimpernel</a>), over-the-top <a href="English%20Renaissance%20theatre">theatrical actors</a>, a squirrel-hating <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a> (<a href="Miranda%20Richardson">Miranda Richardson</a>), and a <a href="duel">duel</a> with the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> (<a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a>).

This series is set in 1917, on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in the trenches of the First World War. Another "big push" is planned, and <a href="Captain%20Blackadder">Captain Blackadder</a>'s one goal is to avoid being killed, but his schemes always land him back in the trenches. Blackadder is joined by his <a href="batman%20%28military%29">batman</a> <a href="Baldrick%23Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Private S. Baldrick</a> (Tony Robinson) and idealistic <a href="Edwardian%20period">Edwardian</a> twit <a href="George%20%28Blackadder%29%23Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Lieutenant George</a> (<a href="Hugh%20Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a>). <a href="General%20Melchett">General Melchett</a> (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French <a href="ch%C3%A2teau">château</a> thirty-five miles from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, <a href="Kevin%20Darling">Captain Kevin Darling</a> (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder's nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedic value.

The series' tone is somewhat darker than the other "Blackadder"s; it details the deprivations of trench warfare as well as the incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass. For example, Baldrick is reduced to making coffee from mud and cooking rats, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops to walk very slowly toward the German lines, because "it'll be the last thing Fritz will expect."

The final episode, "<a href="Goodbyeee">Goodbyeee</a>", is known for being extraordinarily poignant for a comedy—especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally going "<a href="Trench%20warfare">over the top</a>" and charging off into the fog and smoke of <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> to die. In a list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>, drawn up by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals, "Blackadder Goes Forth" was placed 16th.

The "Blackadder" pilot was shot but never aired on terrestrial TV in the UK (although some scenes were shown in the 25th anniversary special "Blackadder Rides Again"). One notable difference in the pilot, as in many pilots, is the casting. Baldrick is played not by Tony Robinson, but by <a href="Philip%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Philip Fox</a>. Another significant difference is that the character of Prince Edmund presented in the pilot is much closer to the intelligent, conniving Blackadder of the later series than the snivelling, weak buffoon of the original. Set in the year 1582, the script of the pilot is roughly the same as the episode "<a href="Born%20to%20be%20King">Born to be King</a>", albeit with some different jokes, with some lines appearing in other episodes of the series.

This special, set in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, was shown as part of <a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Comic Relief</a>'s <a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Red Nose Day</a> on Friday 5 February 1988. The 15-minute episode is set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War. Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> (played by Stephen Fry, portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, slightly dim character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I's namesake, the <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">current Prince of Wales</a>). However, due to a misunderstanding between <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> (guest-star <a href="Warren%20Clarke">Warren Clarke</a>) and Baldrick, the king is arrested and sent to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder's attempts to save the king, as well as improve his standing.

The second special was broadcast on Friday 23 December 1988. In a twist on <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", <a href="Ebenezer%20Blackadder">Ebenezer Blackadder</a> is the "kindest and loveliest" man in England. The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick. This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, "Bad guys have all the fun", and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar.

"Blackadder: Back & Forth" was originally shown in the <a href="Millennium%20Dome">Millennium Dome</a> in 2000, followed by a screening on <a href="Sky1">Sky One</a> in the same year (and later on BBC1). It is set on the turn of the <a href="millennium">millennium</a>, and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends – modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny) – that he has built a working <a href="Time%20travel%20in%20fiction">time machine</a>. While this is intended as a clever <a href="confidence%20trick">con trick</a>, the machine, surprisingly, works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the <a href="Cretaceous%20period">Cretaceous period</a>, where they manage to cause <a href="Cretaceous%20extinction%20event">the extinction</a> of the <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, through the use of Baldrick's best-worst-and-only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry <a href="Tyrannosaurus">T. Rex</a>. Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine's dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process that must be corrected before the end. The film includes <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s from <a href="Kate%20Moss">Kate Moss</a> and <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>.

Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis developed the idea for the sitcom while working on "<a href="Not%20the%20Nine%20O%27Clock%20News">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a>". Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed "<a href="Fawlty%20Towers">Fawlty Towers</a>", they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom. An <a href="The%20Black%20Adder%20%28unaired%20pilot%29">unaired pilot episode</a> was made in 1982, and a six episode series was commissioned. The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a> in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983. The series also used large casts of extras, horses and expensive medieval-style costumes. Atkinson has said about the making of the first series:

The first series was odd, it was very extravagant. It cost a million pounds for the six programmes ... [which] was a lot of money to spend ... It looked great, but it wasn't as consistently funny as we would have liked.

Due to the high cost of the first series, the then-controller of programming of <a href="BBC1">BBC1</a>, <a href="Michael%20Grade">Michael Grade</a>, was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements and cost cutting to be made to the show, leaving a gap of three years between the two series. Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series.

A chance meeting between Richard Curtis and comedian <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a> led to the decision to collaborate on a new series of Blackadder. Recognising the main faults of the first series, Curtis and Elton agreed that "Blackadder II" would be a studio-only production (along with the inclusion of a live audience during recording, instead of showing the episodes to one after taping). Besides adding a greater comedy focus, Elton suggested a major change in character emphasis: Baldrick would become the stupid <a href="sidekick">sidekick</a>, while Edmund Blackadder evolved into a cunning <a href="sycophant">sycophant</a>. This led to the familiar set-up that was maintained in the following series.

Only in the "Back & Forth" millennium special was the shooting once again on location, because this was a production with a budget estimated at £3 million, and was a joint venture between <a href="Tiger%20Aspect%20Productions">Tiger Aspect</a>, <a href="Sky%20Television%20plc">Sky Television</a>, the New Millennium Experience Company and the BBC, rather than the BBC alone.

Each series tended to feature the same set of regular actors in different period settings, although throughout the four series and specials, only Blackadder and Baldrick were constant characters. Several regular cast members recurred as characters with similar names, implying, like Blackadder, that they were descendants.

Various actors have appeared in more than one of the Blackadder series and/or specials. These are:



<a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a>'s arrival after the first series heralded the more frequent recruitment of comic actors from the famed "<a href="alternative%20comedy">alternative</a>" era for guest appearances, including <a href="Robbie%20Coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</a>, <a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a> (who had appeared in the final episode of the first series as "Mad Gerald"), <a href="Adrian%20Edmondson">Adrian Edmondson</a>, <a href="Nigel%20Planer">Nigel Planer</a>, <a href="Mark%20Arden">Mark Arden</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Frost">Stephen Frost</a>, <a href="Chris%20Barrie">Chris Barrie</a> and <a href="Jeremy%20Hardy">Jeremy Hardy</a>. Elton himself played an anarchist in "Blackadder the Third".

<a href="Gabrielle%20Glaister">Gabrielle Glaister</a> played <a href="Bob%20%28Blackadder%20character%29">Bob</a>—an attractive girl who poses as a man—in both series 2 and 4. <a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a> plays <a href="Lord%20Flashheart">Lord Flashheart</a>, a vulgar friend in his first appearance and then a successful rival of Blackadder in a later episode of series 2 and 4. He also played a decidedly Flashheart-like <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> in "Back & Forth". <a href="Lee%20Cornes">Lee Cornes</a> also appeared in an episode of all three Curtis-Elton series. He appeared as a guard in the episode "Chains" of "Blackadder II"; as the poet <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a> in the episode "Ink and Incapability' of "Blackadder the Third"; and as firing squad soldier <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">Private</a> Fraser in the episode "Corporal Punishment" of "Blackadder Goes Forth".

More "establishment"-style actors, some at the veteran stage of their careers, were also recruited for roles. These included <a href="Peter%20Cook">Peter Cook</a>, <a href="John%20Grillo">John Grillo</a>, <a href="Simon%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Simon Jones</a>, <a href="Tom%20Baker">Tom Baker</a>, <a href="Jim%20Broadbent">Jim Broadbent</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Paddick">Hugh Paddick</a>, <a href="Frank%20Finlay">Frank Finlay</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Connor">Kenneth Connor</a>, <a href="Bill%20Wallis">Bill Wallis</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Lacey">Ronald Lacey</a>, Roger Blake, <a href="Denis%20Lill">Denis Lill</a>, <a href="Warren%20Clarke">Warren Clarke</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Palmer%20%28actor%29">Geoffrey Palmer</a>, who played <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig</a> in "<a href="Goodbyeee">Goodbyeee</a>", the final episode of "Blackadder Goes Forth". <a href="Miriam%20Margolyes">Miriam Margolyes</a> played three different guest roles: The Spanish Infanta in <a href="The%20Queen%20of%20Spain%27s%20Beard%20%28Blackadder%29">The Queen of Spain's Beard</a>, Lady Whiteadder in <a href="Beer%20%28Blackadder%29">Beer</a>, and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> in <a href="Blackadder%27s%20Christmas%20Carol">Blackadder's Christmas Carol</a>.

Unusually for a sitcom based loosely on factual events and in the historical past, a man was recruited for one episode essentially to play himself. Political commentator <a href="Vincent%20Hanna">Vincent Hanna</a> played a character billed as "his own great-great-great grandfather" in the episode "<a href="Dish%20and%20Dishonesty%20%28Blackadder%29">Dish and Dishonesty</a>" of "Blackadder the Third". Hanna was asked to take part because the scene was of a by-election in which Baldrick was a candidate and, in the style of modern television, Hanna gave a long-running "live" commentary of events at the count (and interviewed candidates and election agents) to a crowd through the <a href="town%20hall">town hall</a> window.

<a href="Howard%20Goodall">Howard Goodall</a>'s <a href="theme%20music">theme tune</a> has the same <a href="melody">melody</a> throughout all the series, but is played in roughly the <a href="History%20of%20music">style of the period</a> in which it is set. It is performed mostly with trumpets and <a href="timpani">timpani</a> in "The Black Adder", the fanfares used suggesting typical medieval court fanfares; with a combination of <a href="Recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorder</a>, <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> and electric guitar in "Blackadder II"; on <a href="oboe">oboe</a>, cello and <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a> (in the style of a <a href="minuet">minuet</a>) for "Blackadder the Third"; by The Band of the <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Anglian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment</a> in "Blackadder Goes Forth"; sung by <a href="Carol%20%28music%29">carol singers</a> in "Blackadder's Christmas Carol"; and by an orchestra in "Blackadder: The Cavalier Years" and "Blackadder: Back & Forth".

In 2000, the fourth series, "<a href="Blackadder%20Goes%20Forth">Blackadder Goes Forth</a>", ranked at 16 in the "<a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a>", a list created by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>. In 2004, a BBC TV poll for "<a href="Britain%27s%20Best%20Sitcom">Britain's Best Sitcom</a>", "Blackadder" was voted the second best British sitcom of all time, topped by "<a href="Only%20Fools%20and%20Horses">Only Fools and Horses</a>". It was also ranked as the 20th Best TV Show of All Time by "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine.

Despite regular statements denying any plans for a fifth series, cast members are regularly asked about the possibility of a new series.

In January 2005, Tony Robinson told <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a>'s "<a href="This%20Morning%20%28TV%20programme%29">This Morning</a>" that Rowan Atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past to do a fifth series, set in the 1960s (centred on a rock band called the "Black Adder Five", with <a href="Baldrick">Baldrick</a> – a.k.a. 'Bald Rick' – as the drummer). In the documentary "Blackadder Rides Again", Robinson stated that the series would present Blackadder as the bastard son of Queen Elizabeth II and running a Beatles-like rock band. Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson would have reprised their roles, and reportedly, Brian Blessed, Elspet Gray and Robert East would have returned from the first series to play Blackadder's biological family. Robinson in a stage performance 1 June 2007, again mentioned this idea, but in the context of a movie.

One idea mentioned by Curtis was that it was Baldrick who had accidentally <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassinated</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. However, aside from a brief mention in June 2005,
there have been no further announcements from the BBC that a new series is being planned. Furthermore, in November 2005, Rowan Atkinson told "<a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a>" that, although he would very much like to do a new series set in <a href="Colditz">Colditz</a> or another <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a> during World War II, something which both he and Stephen Fry reiterated at the end of "Blackadder Rides Again", the chances of it happening are extremely slim.

There were a couple of ideas that had previously floated for the fifth series. "Batadder" was intended to be a parody of "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>" with Baldrick as the counterpart of <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a> (suggested by <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28producer%29">John Lloyd</a>). This idea eventually came to surface as part of the "<a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Comic Relief</a>" sketch "<a href="Spider-Plant%20Man">Spider-Plant Man</a>" in 2005, with Atkinson as <a href="Spider-Man">the title hero</a>, Robinson as Robin, <a href="Jim%20Broadbent">Jim Broadbent</a> as Batman and <a href="Rachel%20Stevens">Rachel Stevens</a> as <a href="Mary%20Jane%20Watson">Mary Jane</a>. "Star Adder" was to be set in space in the future (suggested by Atkinson), though this too was touched upon in "Blackadder's Christmas Carol".

On 10 April 2007, "<a href="Hello%21">Hello!</a>" reported that Atkinson was moving forward with his ideas for a fifth series. He said, "I like the idea of him being a prisoner of war in Colditz. That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders."

A post on BlackAdderHall.com by Ben Elton in early 2007 said that "Blackadder" would return in some form, whether it be a TV series or movie. Elton has since not given any more information on the putative "Blackadder 5".

During an interview in August 2007 about his movie "<a href="Mr.%20Bean%27s%20Holiday">Mr. Bean's Holiday</a>", Atkinson was asked about the possibility of a further "Blackadder" series, to which the simple reply "No, no chance" was given:

Stephen Fry has expressed the view that, since the series went out on such a good "high", a film might not be a good idea.

During his June 2007 stage performance, chronicled on the Tony Robinson's Cunning Night Out DVD, Robinson states that, after filming the "Back & Forth special", the general idea was to reunite for another special in 2010. Robinson jokingly remarked that Hugh Laurie's success on "<a href="House%20%28TV%20series%29">House</a>" may make that difficult.

At the end of "Blackadder Rides Again", Robinson asked Tim McInnerny if he would do another series and he responded "no", because he thought people would not want to see them as they are now and would rather remember them for how they were. In the same documentary, Rowan Atkinson voiced his similar view; 'Times past; that's what they were!' However, Miranda Richardson and Tony Robinson expressed enthusiasm towards the idea of a series set in the Wild West, whilst John Lloyd favoured an idea for a series with a <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> Blackadder. Lastly, Stephen Fry suggested a series set in a prisoner of war camp during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but later remarked that "perhaps it's best to leave these things as a memory."

On 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role at the "We are most amused" comedy gala for the <a href="Prince%27s%20Trust">Prince's Trust</a> at the Royal Albert Hall. He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis.

In August 2015, Tony Robinson said in an interview "I do think a new series of Blackadder is on the cards. I have spoken to virtually all the cast about this now. The only problem is Hugh [Laurie]'s fee. He's a huge star now."

All series and many of the specials are available on DVD and <a href="VHS">video</a>. Many are also available on BBC audio cassette. As of 2008, a "Best of BBC" edition box set is available containing all four major series together with "Blackadder's Christmas Carol" and "Back & Forth". All four series and the Christmas special are also available for download on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>.

5 February 1990, BBC Enterprises Ltd released the first series on two single videos.

2 October 1989, BBC Enterprises Ltd released the second series on two single videos.

6 March 1989, BBC Enterprises Ltd released the third series on two single videos.

10 September 1990, BBC Enterprises Ltd released the fourth and final series on two single videos.

On 7 September 1992, all eight single Blackadder video releases were re-released as four "complete" double VHS releases. The four entire series videos were re-released as single video releases on 2 October 1995.

On 5 January 1998, five episodes of the first two series were released on a 15 rated compiled video by BBC Worldwide Ltd.

On 4 November 1991, "Blackadder's Christmas Carol" was released on a single video release rated PG (Cat. No. BBCV 4646)

Boii

The Boii (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> plural, singular "Boius"; ) were a <a href="Gauls">Gallic</a> tribe of the later <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, attested at various times in <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a> (northern <a href="Italy">Italy</a>), <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> (<a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and its western neighbours), parts of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, in and around <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (after whom the region is named in most languages; comprising the bulk of the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>), and <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>. In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the <a href="K%C5%82odzko%20Valley">Kłodzko Valley</a> into <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, now part of <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>.

They first appear in history in connection with the <a href="Campaign%20history%20of%20the%20Roman%20military%23Celtic%20invasion%20of%20Italia%20%28390%E2%80%93387%20BC%29">Gallic invasion of north Italy</a>, 390 BC, when they made the <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> city of Felsina their new capital, <a href="Bologna">Bononia (Bologna)</a>. After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina%20%28193%20BC%29">Battle of Mutina</a> (193 BCE) and their territory became part of the Roman province of <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>. According to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours,

Around 60 BC, a group of Boii joined the <a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a>'s ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, along with their allies, in the <a href="battle%20of%20Bibracte">battle of Bibracte</a>. Caesar settled the remnants of that group in <a href="Gorgobina">Gorgobina</a>, from where they sent two thousand to <a href="Vercingetorix">Vercingetorix</a>'s aid at the <a href="battle%20of%20Alesia">battle of Alesia</a> six years later. The eastern Boii on the Danube were incorporated into the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 8 AD.

From all the different names of the same Celtic people in literature and inscriptions it is possible to abstract a <a href="Continental%20Celtic%20languages">Continental Celtic</a> segment, "boio"-. There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a>: from 'cow' and from 'warrior.' The Boii would thus be either "the herding people" or "the warrior people."

The "cow" derivation depends most immediately on the <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a> legal term for "outsider:" "ambue", from <a href="Proto-Celtic%20language">Proto-Celtic</a> "*ambouios" (<"*an-bouios"), "not a cattle owner." In a reference to the first known historical Boii, <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> relates that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man's status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had. The latter were presumably the "*ambouii", as opposed to the man of status, who was "*bouios", a cattle owner, and the "*bouii" were originally a class, "the cattle owners."
The "warrior" derivation was adopted by the linguist <a href="Julius%20Pokorny">Julius Pokorny</a>, who presented it as being from Indo-European *bhei(ə)-, *bhī-, "hit;" however, not finding any Celtic names close to it (except for the Boii), he adduces examples somewhat more widely from originals further back in time: phohiio-s-, a <a href="Venetic%20language">Venetic</a> personal name; Boioi, an <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>n tribe; Boiōtoi, a Greek tribal name ("the <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>ns") and a few others. Boii would be from the <a href="apophony">o-grade</a> of *bhei-, which is *bhoi-. Such a connection is possible if the original form of Boii belonged to a tribe of <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> speakers long before the time of the historic Boii. If that is the case, then the Celtic tribe of central Europe must have been a final daughter population of a linguistically diversifying ancestor tribe.

The same wider connections can be hypothesized for the "cow" derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of <a href="Italy%23Etymology">Italy</a> as a "land of calves." Indo-European reconstructions can be made using "cow" as a basis, such as ; the root may itself be echoic of the sound a cow makes.

Contemporary derived words include "<a href="Boiorix">Boiorix</a>" ("king of the Boii", one of the chieftains of the <a href="Cimbri">Cimbri</a>) and "Boiodurum" ("gate/fort of the Boii", modern <a href="Passau">Passau</a>) in Germany. Their memory also survives in the modern regional names of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> ("Boiohaemum"), a mixed-language form from boio- and <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Proto-Germanic</a> *"haimaz", "home": "home of the Boii," and 'Bayern', <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, which is derived from the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> "Baiovarii" tribe (Germ. "*baja-warjaz": the first component is most plausibly explained as a Germanic version of "Boii"; the second part is a common formational morpheme of Germanic tribal names, meaning 'dwellers', as in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "-ware"); this combination "Boii-dwellers" may have meant "those who dwell where the Boii formerly dwelt".

According to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. While of the other tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the <a href="Senones">Senones</a>, <a href="Lingones">Lingones</a> and <a href="Cenomani">Cenomani</a> are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest, there is no such clear evidence for the Boii in Gaul. It remains therefore unclear where exactly the <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>an origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, <a href="Southern%20Germany">Southern Germany</a> or in Bohemia.

<a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> relates that the <a href="Celts">Celts</a> were close neighbors of the <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan civilization</a> and "cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country." Invading the <a href="Po%20Valley">Po Valley</a> with a large army, they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts. The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of Felsina, which they named "Bononia" (modern <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>). Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a> as follows:
The archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave. It much rather indicates that the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage. The cemeteries of the period in Bologna contain <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture">La Tène</a> weapons and other artifacts, as well as Etruscan items such as bronze mirrors. At <a href="Pianoro">Monte Bibele</a> not far away one grave contained La Tène weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it.

In the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome. They also fought alongside <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, killing the Roman general <a href="Lucius%20Postumius%20Albinus%20%28consul%20234%20BC%29">Lucius Postumius Albinus</a> in 216 BC, whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl. A short time earlier, they had been defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Telamon">Battle of Telamon</a> in 224 BC, and were again at <a href="Battle%20of%20Placentia%20%28194%20BC%29">Placentia in 194 BC</a> (modern <a href="Piacenza">Piacenza</a>) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina%20%28193%20BC%29">Mutina in 193 BC</a> (modern <a href="Modena">Modena</a>). After the loss of their capital, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy.

Contrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier. The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as <a href="inhumation">inhumation</a>, which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic <a href="torc">torc</a>s. This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round. Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk.

The Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the <a href="Cimbri">Cimbri</a> and <a href="Teutones">Teutones</a> (Strabo VII, 2, 2). Later on, they attacked the city of <a href="Noreia">Noreia</a> (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> - the number is probably an exaggeration) joined the <a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a> in their attempt to settle in western Gaul. After the Helvetian defeat at <a href="Bibracte">Bibracte</a>, the influential <a href="Aedui">Aedui</a> tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the "oppidum" of <a href="Gorgobina">Gorgobina</a>. Although attacked by <a href="Vercingetorix">Vercingetorix</a> during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of <a href="Alesia%20%28city%29">Alesia</a> (Caes. Bell. Gall., VII, 75).

Again, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and <a href="Hungary">Hungarian lowlands</a> by the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and the <a href="Mur%20River">Mura</a>, with a centre at <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>. Around 60 BC they clashed with the rising power of the <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> under their king <a href="Burebista">Burebista</a> and were defeated. When the Romans finally conquered <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> in 8 AD, the Boii seem not to have opposed them. Their former territory was now called "deserta Boiorum" (deserta meaning 'empty or sparsely populated lands'). However, the Boii had not been exterminated: There was a "civitas Boiorum et Azaliorum" (the Azalii being a neighbouring tribe) which was under the jurisdiction of a prefect of the Danube shore ("praefectus ripae Danuvii"). This civitas, a common Roman administrative term designating both a city and the tribal district around it, was later adjoined to the city of <a href="Carnuntum">Carnuntum</a>.

<a href="Plautus">Plautus</a> refers to the Boii in "<a href="Captivi">Captivi</a>":
There is a play on words: "Boia" means "woman of the Boii", also "convicted criminal's restraint collar".

In volume 21 of his "<a href="Ab%20Urbe%20Condita%20Libri%20%28Livy%29">Ab Urbe Condita Libri</a>", <a href="Livy">Livy</a> (59 BC - 17 AD) claims that it was a Boio man that offered to show Hannibal the way across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>.
In the first century BC, the Boii living in an <a href="oppidum">oppidum</a> of <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a> minted <a href="Biatec">Biatec</a>s, high-quality coins with inscriptions (probably the names of kings) in Latin letters. This is the only "written source" provided by the Boii themselves.

<doc id="4329" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4329" title="Backgammon">
Backgammon

Backgammon is one of the oldest <a href="board%20game">board game</a>s known. It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of <a href="dice">dice</a>, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. Backgammon is a member of the <a href="Tables%20%28board%20game%29">tables</a> family, one of the oldest classes of board games.

Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like <a href="poker">poker</a>. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent. The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game.

Like <a href="chess">chess</a>, backgammon has been studied with great interest by <a href="Computer%20science">computer scientists</a>. Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players (see <a href="TD-Gammon">TD-Gammon</a> for an example).

Backgammon playing pieces are known variously as <a href="draughts">checkers, draughts</a>, stones, men, <a href="Boardgame%20counter">counters</a>, pawns, discs, pips, chips, or nips.

The objective is to remove ("bear off") all of one's own checkers from the board before one's opponent can do the same. In the most often-played variants the checkers are scattered at first; as the game progresses they may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points.

Each side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points. The points form a continuous track in the shape of a <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a>, and are numbered from 1 to 24. In the most commonly used setup, each player begins with fifteen checkers, two are placed on their 24-point, three on their 8-point, and five each on their 13-point and their 6-point. The two players move their checkers in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point.

Points 1 through 6 are called the home board or inner board, and points 7 through 12 are called the outer board. The 7-point is referred to as the bar point, and the 13-point as the midpoint.

To start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using the numbers shown on both dice. If the players roll the same number, they must roll again. Both dice must land completely flat on the right-hand side of the gameboard. The players then alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn.

After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die. For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (denoted as "6-3"), the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward. The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally: six and then three, or three and then six. If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice. For example, a roll of 5-5 allows the player to make four moves of five spaces each. On any roll, a player must move according to the numbers on both dice if it is at all possible to do so. If one or both numbers do not allow a legal move, the player forfeits that portion of the roll and his or her turn ends. If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used. If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory.

In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player's own checkers. It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or "blot". In this case, the blot has been "hit", and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface. A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously. There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point at any given time.

Checkers placed on the bar must re-enter the game through the opponent's home board before any other move can be made. A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent's 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent's 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent's 6). Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers. Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and placed on the bar. More than one checker can be on the bar at a time. A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board. If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move. If the opponent's home board is completely "closed" (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves.

When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called "bearing off". A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on. If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player may use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point. For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point. When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized. For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically. As before, if there is a way to use all moves showing on the dice, by moving checkers within the home board or bearing them off, the player must do so.

If one player has not borne off any checkers by the time the opponent has borne off all fifteen, then the player has lost a "gammon", which counts for double a normal loss. If the losing player has not borne off any checkers and still has checkers on the bar or in the opponent's home board, then the player has lost a "backgammon", which counts for three times a normal loss.

To speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used. The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled but rather a marker with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides, to denote the current stake. At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be "centered, on 1". When the cube is centered, the player about to roll may propose that the game be played for twice the current stakes. Their opponent must either accept ("take") the doubled stakes or resign ("drop") the game immediately.

Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding <a href="power%20of%20two">power of two</a> facing upward, to indicate that the right to re-double belongs exclusively to the player who last accepted a double. If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, he or she loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube. For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake.

The game is rarely redoubled beyond four times the original stake, but there is no limit on the number of redoubles. Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on. In money games, a player is often permitted to "beaver" when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube.

A variant of the doubling cube "beaver" is the "raccoon". Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again ("raccoon") as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled. The opponent retains the doubling cube. E.g. White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, while Black retains the cube. Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change.

Some players may opt to invoke The Murphy rule or the "automatic double rule". If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player. The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing. When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points). The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments.

The Jacoby rule, named after <a href="Oswald%20Jacoby">Oswald Jacoby</a>, allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted. This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon. The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play.

The Crawford rule, named after <a href="John%20R.%20Crawford">John R. Crawford</a>, is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead. If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up. Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match. To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the Crawford game. After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes. The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play. It is possible for a Crawford game never to occur in a match.

If the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the Holland rule, named after 
<a href="Tim%20Holland%20%28backgammon%29">Tim Holland</a>, which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side. It was common in tournament play in the 1980s but is now rarely used.

There are many variants of standard backgammon rules. Some are played primarily throughout one geographic region, and others add new tactical elements to the game. Variants commonly alter the starting position, restrict certain moves, or assign special value to certain dice rolls, but in some geographic regions even the rules and directions of the checkers movement change, rendering the game fundamentally different.

<a href="Acey-deucey">Acey-deucey</a> is a variant of backgammon in which players start with no checkers on the board, and must bear them on at the beginning of the game. The roll of 1-2 is given special consideration, allowing the player, after moving the 1 and the 2, to select any desired doubles move. A player also receives an extra turn after a roll of 1-2 or of doubles.

<a href="Hypergammon">Hypergammon</a> is a variant of backgammon in which players have only three checkers on the board, starting with one each on the 24-, 23- and 22-points. The game has been <a href="solved%20game">strongly solved</a>, meaning that exact <a href="expected%20value">equities</a> are available for all 32 million possible positions.

<a href="N%C9%99rd">Nərd</a> is a traditional variant from <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> in which basic rules are almost the same except that even a single piece is 'safe'. There are also different starting positions.

Nackgammon is a variant of backgammon invented by Nick "Nack" Ballard in which players start with one less checker on the six point and midpoint and two checkers on the 23 point.

Russian backgammon is a variant described in 1895 as: "...much in vogue in Russia, Germany, and other parts of the Continent...". Players start with no checkers on the board, and both players move in the same direction to bear off in a common home board. In this variant, doubles are more powerful: four moves are played as in standard backgammon, followed by four moves according to the difference of the dice value from 7, and then the player has another turn (with the caveat that the turn ends if any portion of it cannot be completed).

<a href="Gul%20bara">Gul Bara</a> and <a href="Tapa%20%28game%29">Tapa</a> are also variants of the game popular in southeastern Europe and Turkey. The play will iterate among Backgammon, Gul Bara, and Tapa until one of the players reaches a score of 7 or 5.

<a href="Coan%20ki">Coan ki</a> is an ancient Chinese board game that is very similar.
<a href="Plakoto">Plakoto</a>, Fevga and Portes are three versions of backgammon played in Greece. Together, the three are referred to as <a href="Tables%20%28board%20game%29%23Greece%20and%20Cyprus">Tavli</a>.

Other minor variants to the standard game are common among casual players in certain regions. For instance, only allowing a maximum of five checkers on any point (Britain) or disallowing "hit-and-run" in your home board (Middle East).

Backgammon has an established <a href="Backgammon%20opening%20theory">opening theory</a>, although it is less detailed than that of chess. The <a href="Game%20tree">tree</a> of positions expands rapidly because of the number of possible dice rolls and the moves available on each turn. Recent computer analysis has offered more insight on opening plays, but the midgame is reached quickly. After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game.

The most direct strategy is simply to avoid being hit, trapped, or held in a stand-off. A "running game" describes a strategy of moving as quickly as possible around the board, and is most successful when a player is already ahead in the race. When this fails, one may opt for a "holding game", maintaining control of a point on one's opponent's side of the board, called an anchor. As the game progresses, this player may gain an advantage by hitting an opponent's blot from the anchor, or by rolling large doubles that allow the checkers to escape into a running game.

The "priming game" involves building a wall of checkers, called a prime, covering a number of consecutive points. This obstructs opposing checkers that are behind the prime. A checker trapped behind a six-point prime cannot escape until the prime is broken. A particularly successful priming effort may lead to a "blitz", which is a strategy of covering the entire home board as quickly as possible while keeping one's opponent on the bar. Because the opponent has difficulty re-entering from the bar or escaping, a player can quickly gain a running advantage and win the game, often with a gammon.

A "backgame" is a strategy that involves holding two or more anchors in an opponent's home board while being substantially behind in the race. The anchors obstruct the opponent's checkers and create opportunities to hit them as they move home. The backgame is generally used only to salvage a game wherein a player is already significantly behind. Using a backgame as an initial strategy is usually unsuccessful.

"Duplication" refers to the placement of checkers such that one's opponent needs the same dice rolls to achieve different goals. For example, players may position all of their blots in such a way that the opponent must roll a 2 in order to hit any of them, reducing the probability of being hit more than once. "Diversification" refers to a complementary tactic of placing one's own checkers in such a way that more numbers are useful.

Many positions require a measurement of a player's standing in the race, for example, in making a doubling cube decision, or in determining whether to run home and begin bearing off. The minimum total of dice rolls needed to move a player's checkers around and off the board is called the "pip count". The difference between the two players' pip counts is frequently used as a measure of the leader's racing advantage. Players often use <a href="mental%20calculation">mental calculation</a> techniques to determine pip counts in live play.

Backgammon is played in two principal variations, "Money" and "Match" play. Money play means that every point counts evenly and every game stands alone, whether money is actually being wagered or not. "Match" play means that the players play until one side scores (or exceeds) a certain number of points. The format has a significant effect on strategy. In a match, the objective is not to win the maximum possible number of points, but rather to simply reach the score needed to win the match. For example, a player leading a 9-point match by a score of 7-5 would be very reluctant to turn the doubling cube, as their opponent could take and make a costless redouble to 4, placing the entire outcome of the match on the current game. Conversely, the trailing player would double very aggressively, particularly if s/he has chances to win a gammon in the current game. In money play, the theoretically correct checker play and cube action would never vary based on the score.

In 1975, Emmet Keeler and Joel Spencer considered the question of when to double or accept a double using an idealized version of backgammon. In their idealized version, the probability of winning varies randomly over time by <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>, and there are no gammons or backgammons. They showed that the optimal time to offer a double was when the probability of winning reached 80%, and it is wise to accept a double only if the probability of winning is at least 20%. As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb.

To reduce the possibility of cheating, most good quality backgammon sets use <a href="Dice%23Precision%20dice">precision dice</a> and a <a href="dice%20cup">dice cup</a>. This reduces the likelihood of <a href="Dice%23Loaded%20dice">loaded dice</a> being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play. A common method of cheating online is the use of a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player's moves resemble those of a backgammon program. Online cheating has therefore become extremely difficult.

In State of Oregon v Barr, a 1982 court case pivotal to the continued widespread organised playing of backgammon in the USA, the State argued backgammon is a game of chance and that it was therefore subject to Oregon's stringent gambling laws.

<a href="Paul%20Magriel">Paul Magriel</a> was a key witness for the defence, contradicting Dr. Roger Nelson, the expert prosecution witness, by saying, "Game theory, however, really applies to games with imperfect knowledge, where something is concealed, such as poker. Backgammon is not such a game. Everything is in front of you. The person who uses that information in the most effective manner will win."

After the closing arguments, Judge Stephen S. Walker concluded that backgammon is a game of skill, not a game of chance, and found the defendant, backgammon tournament director Ted Barr, not guilty of promoting gambling.

Enthusiasts have formed <a href="Club%20%28organization%29">club</a>s for social play of backgammon. Local clubs may hold informal gatherings, with members meeting at cafés and bars in the evening to play and converse. A few clubs offer additional services, maintaining their own facilities or offering computer analysis of troublesome plays. Some club leaders have noticed a recent growth of interest in backgammon, and attribute it to the game's popularity on the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>.

A <a href="backgammon%20chouette">backgammon chouette</a> permits three or more players to participate in a single game, often for money. One player competes against a team of all the other participants, and positions rotate after each game. Chouette play often permits the use of multiple doubling cubes.

Backgammon clubs may also organize <a href="tournaments">tournaments</a>. Large club tournaments sometimes draw competitors from other regions, with final matches viewed by hundreds of spectators. The top players at regional tournaments often compete in major national and international championships. Winners at major tournaments may receive prizes of tens of thousands of <a href="US%20dollar">dollars</a>.

The first world championship competition in backgammon was held in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> in 1967. <a href="Tim%20Holland%20%28backgammon%29">Tim Holland</a> was declared the winner that year and at the tournament the following year. For unknown reasons, there was no championship in 1970, but in 1971, Tim Holland again won the title. The competition remained in Las Vegas until 1975, when it moved to <a href="Paradise%20Island">Paradise Island</a> in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. The years 1976, 1977 & 1978 saw "dual" World Championships, one in the Bahamas attended by the Americans, and the "European Open Championships" in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a> with mostly European players. In 1979, Lewis Deyong, who had promoted the Bahamas World Championship for the prior three years, suggested that the two events be combined. Monte Carlo was universally acknowledged as the site of the World Backgammon Championship and has remained as such for thirty years. The Monte Carlo tournament draws hundreds of players and spectators, and is played over the course of a week.

By the 21st century, the largest international tournaments had established the basis of a tour for top professional players. Major tournaments are held yearly worldwide. <a href="PartyGaming">PartyGaming</a> sponsored the first <a href="World%20Series%20of%20Backgammon">World Series of Backgammon</a> in 2006 from Cannes and later the 'Backgammon Million' tournament held in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> in January 2007 with a prize pool of one million dollars, the largest for any tournament to date. In 2008, the <a href="World%20Series%20of%20Backgammon">World Series of Backgammon</a> ran the world's largest international events in London, the UK Masters, the biggest tournament ever held in the UK with 128 international class players; the Nordic Open, which instantly became the largest in the world with around 500 players in all flights and 153 in the Championship, and Cannes, which hosted the Riviera Cup, the traditional follow-up tournament to the World Championships. Cannes also hosted the WSOB Championship, the WSOB finale, which saw 16 players play three-point shootout matches for €160,000. The event was recorded for television in Europe airing on Eurosport.

The World Backgammon Association (WBA) has been holding the biggest backgammon Tour of the circuit since 2007, the "European Backgammon Tour" (EBGT). In 2011, the WBA collaborated with the online backgammon provider <a href="Play65">Play65</a> for the 2011 season of the European Backgammon Tour and with "Betfair" in 2012. The 2013 season of the European Backgammon Tour featured 11 stops and 19 qualified players competing for 19,000 € in a Grand Finale in <a href="Lefkosa">Lefkosa</a>, <a href="Northern%20Cyprus">Northern Cyprus</a>. WBA also staged the "US Open" and other events around the globe. WBA has contributed to a high-stakes event called "Crowns Cup" broadcast on several TV-channels.

When backgammon is <a href="Gambling">played for money</a>, the most common arrangement is to assign a monetary value to each point, and to play to a certain score, or until either player chooses to stop. The stakes are raised by gammons, backgammons, and use of the doubling cube. Backgammon is sometimes available in <a href="casino">casino</a>s. Before the commercialization of <a href="neural%20network">neural network</a> programs, <a href="proposition%20bet">proposition bet</a>s on specific positions were very common among backgammon players and gamblers. As with most gambling games, successful play requires a combination of luck and skill, as a single dice roll can sometimes significantly change the outcome of the game.

Backgammon software has been developed not only to play and analyze games, but also to facilitate play between humans over the <a href="internet">internet</a>. Dice rolls are provided by <a href="random%20number%20generator">random</a> or <a href="pseudorandom%20number%20generator">pseudorandom number generator</a>s. Real-time online play began with the <a href="First%20Internet%20Backgammon%20Server">First Internet Backgammon Server</a> in July 1992, but there are now a range of options; many of which are commercial.

Backgammon has been studied considerably by <a href="Computer%20science">computer scientists</a>. <a href="Artificial%20neural%20network">Neural networks</a> and other approaches have offered significant advances to software for gameplay and analysis.

The first strong computer opponent was BKG 9.8. It was written by <a href="Hans%20Berliner">Hans Berliner</a> in the late 1970s on a DEC <a href="PDP-10">PDP-10</a> as an experiment in evaluating board game positions. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitional phases in the game. He applied principles of <a href="fuzzy%20logic">fuzzy logic</a> to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the reigning world champion <a href="Luigi%20Villa">Luigi Villa</a>. It won the match, 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game. Berliner stated that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.

In the late 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an approach based on <a href="artificial%20neural%20network">artificial neural network</a>s. <a href="TD-Gammon">TD-Gammon</a>, developed by Gerald Tesauro of <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, was the first of these programs to play near the expert level. Its neural network was trained using <a href="temporal%20difference%20learning">temporal difference learning</a> applied to data generated from self-play. According to assessments by <a href="Bill%20Robertie">Bill Robertie</a> and <a href="Kit%20Woolsey">Kit Woolsey</a>, TD-Gammon's play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world. Woolsey said of the program that "There is no question in my mind that its positional judgment is far better than mine."

Tesauro proposed using <a href="Rollout%20%28backgammon%29">rollout analysis</a> to compare the performance of computer algorithms against human players. In this method, a <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20method">Monte-Carlo evaluation</a> of positions is conducted (typically thousands of trials) where different random dice sequences are simulated. The rollout score of the human (or the computer) is the difference of the average game results by following the selected move versus following the best move, then averaged for the entire set of taken moves.

Neural network research has resulted in three modern <a href="Proprietary%20software">proprietary programs</a>, JellyFish, Snowie and eXtreme Gammon as well as the <a href="shareware">shareware</a> BGBlitz and the <a href="free%20software">free software</a> GNU Backgammon. These programs not only play the game, but offer tools for analyzing games and detailed comparisons of individual moves. The strength of these programs lies in their neural networks' weights tables, which are the result of months of training. Without them, these programs play no better than a human novice. For the bearoff phase, backgammon software usually relies on a database containing precomputed equities for all possible bearoff positions.

Computer-versus-computer competitions are also held at <a href="Computer%20Olympiad%23Backgammon">Computer Olympiad</a> events.

Backgammon Mobile Applications have been developed not only to play against the computer but also to play in communities over the <a href="internet">internet</a>. Currently, the only real money Backgammon community available on Mobile devices is For Money Backgammon by Gamytech.

Excavations at <a href="Shahr-e%20Sukhteh">Shahr-e Sukhteh</a> (<a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> شهر سوخته, literally "The Burnt City") in <a href="Iran">Iran</a> have shown that a board race game existed there around 3000 BC. The artifacts include two dice and 60 checkers, and the set is believed to be 100 to 200 years older than the <a href="Royal%20Game%20of%20Ur">Royal Game of Ur</a>. On the board found at Shahr-e Sukhteh the fields are fashioned by the coils of a snake.

<a href="Touraj%20Daryaee">Touraj Daryaee</a> (2006)—on the subject of the first written mention of early precursors of backgammon—writes:

In the 11th century "<a href="Shahnameh">Shahnameh</a>", the <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n poet <a href="Ferdowsi">Ferdowsi</a> credits <a href="Burzoe">Burzoe</a> with the invention of the tables game "nard" in the 6th century. He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a <a href="Raja">Raja</a> visiting from India. The Raja introduces the game of <a href="chess">chess</a>, and Burzoe demonstrates "nard", played with dice made from <a href="ivory">ivory</a> and <a href="teak">teak</a>. Today, Nard is the name for the Persian version of backgammon, which has different initial positions and objectives. H. J. R. Murray details many versions of backgammon; modern Nard is noted there as being the same as backgammon and maybe dating back to 300–500 AD in the Babylonian Talmud, although others believe the Talmud references the Greek race game Kubeia.
"<a href="Tavli%20%28game%29">Tάβλη (tavli)</a>" meaning "table" or "board" in <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a>, is the oldest game with rules known to be nearly identical to backgammon; it is described in an epigram of <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Emperor Zeno</a> (AD 476–491). The board was the same with 24 points, 12 on each side. As today, each player had 15 checkers and used cubical dice with sides numbered one to six. The object of the game, to be the first to bear off all of one's checkers, was also the same. Hitting a blot, reentering a piece from the bar, and bearing off, all followed the modern rules. The only differences with modern backgammon were the use of an extra die (three rather than two) and the starting of all pieces off the board (with them entering in the same way that pieces on the bar enter in modern backgammon). The name τάβλη is still used for backgammon in Greece, where it is frequently played in town <a href="plateia">plateia</a>s and cafes.The epigram of Zeno describes a particularly bad dice roll the emperor had for his given position. Zeno, who was white, had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two "blots", checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, exposing them and ruining the game for Zeno.

The τάβλη of Zeno's time is believed to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman "<a href="Ludus%20duodecim%20scriptorum">Ludus duodecim scriptorum</a>" ("Game of twelve lines") with that board's middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining. Ludus duodecim scriptorum used a board with three rows of 12 points each with the 15 checkers being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three cubical dice. Little specific text about the gameplay of Ludus duodecim scriptorum has survived; it may have been related to the older <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> dice game Kubeia. The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid's Ars Amatoria (The Art of Love) (written between 1 BC and 8 AD). In Roman times this game was also known as <a href="Alea%20iacta%20est">alea</a>, and a likely apocryphal Latin story linked this name, and the game, to a <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> soldier named Alea.

Race board games involving dice have existed for millennia in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> and eastern Mediterranean, including the game <a href="senet">senet</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Game%20of%20Ur">Royal Game of Ur</a> in Babylon. The ancient Egyptian game senet was excavated, along with illustrations, from Egyptian royal tombs dating to 3500 BC. Though using a board that is quite different from backgammon, it may be a predecessor. The Royal Game of Ur, originating in ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> before 2600 BC, may also be an ancestor of modern-day table games like backgammon. It used tetrahedral dice. In the modern Middle East, backgammon is a common feature of <a href="coffeehouse">coffeehouse</a>s.

Backgammon, which is known as "<a href="tavla">tavla</a>", from <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> <a href="tabula%20%28game%29">τάβλη</a>, is a very popular game in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and it is customary to name the dice rolls with their <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> number names, with local spellings: yek (1), dü (2), se (3), chahar ("cehar") (4), pange ("penç") (5), sheesh ("şeş") (6).

The usual Tavla rules are same as in the other neighboring Arab countries and Greece, as established over a millennium ago, but there are also many quite different variants. The usual tavla is also known as erkek tavlası meaning boys' or men's tavla. The other variant kız tavlası (i.e. girls' tavla) is a game that depends only on the dice and involves no strategy. Another variant, asker tavlası (meaning soldiers' tavla), has the pieces thrown to the board randomly and the opponents try to flip their pieces over the opponents' pieces to beat them.

Backgammon is popular among <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>. It is a game in which Greeks usually tease their opponent and they create a lively atmosphere. The game is called "Tavli", derived in <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> times from the Latin word "tabula". A game, almost identical to backgammon, called <a href="Tabula%20%28game%29">Tavli</a> (<a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a>: τάβλη) is described in an epigram of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Emperor Zeno</a> (AD 476–481). There are four games of <a href="Tavli">Tavli</a> commonly played:

Portes: Set-up and rules the same as backgammon, except that backgammons count as gammons (2 points) and there is no doubling cube.<br>
<a href="Plakoto">Plakoto</a>: A game where one checker can trap another checker on the same point.<br>
Fevga: A game where one checker by itself can block a point.<br>
Asodio: Also known as <a href="Acey-deucey">Acey-deucey</a> where all checkers are off the board, and you enter by rolling either doubles or acey-deucey.<br>
These games are played one after another, in matches of three, five, or seven points. Before starting a match, each player rolls 1 die, and the player with the highest roll picks up both dice and re-rolls (i.e. it is possible to roll doubles for the opening move). Players use the same pair of dice in turns. After the first game, the winner of the previous game starts first. Each game counts as 1 point, if the opponent has borne off at least 1 stone, otherwise 2 points (gammon/backgammon). There is no doubling cube.

Backgammon was popular in China for a time and was known as "shuanglu" (双陆), with the book written during the <a href="Southern%20Song">Southern Song</a> (1127–1279) period recording over ten variants - but over time it was replaced by other games such as <a href="xiangqi">xiangqi</a> (Chinese chess).

In Japan "<a href="sugoroku">ban-sugoroku</a>" is thought to have been introduced from China in the 6th century. As a gambling game it was made illegal several times. In the early Edo-era, a new and quick gambling game called "<a href="Ch%C5%8D-han">Chō-han</a>" appeared and sugoroku quickly dwindled. By the 13th century, the board game <a href="Go%20%28game%29">Go</a>, originally played only by the aristocracy, had become popular among the general public.

In Korea, it is called Ssang-ryuk or Jeopo.

The "jeux de tables" (Games of Tables), predecessors of modern backgammon, first appeared in France during the 11th century and became a favorite pastime of gamblers. In 1254, <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX</a> issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing. Tables games were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> by the 13th century. In <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="Alfonso%20X">Alfonso X</a> manuscript "<a href="Libro%20de%20los%20juegos">Libro de los juegos</a>", completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and table games in addition to its extensive discussion of chess. By the 17th century, table games had spread to <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. A wooden board and checkers were recovered from the wreck of the <a href="Regalskeppet%20Vasa">Vasa</a> among the belongings of the ship's officers. Backgammon appears widely in paintings of this period, mainly those of Dutch and German painters (<a href="Adriaen%20van%20Ostade">Van Ostade</a>, <a href="Jan%20Steen">Jan Steen</a>, <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Bruegel</a> and others). Some surviving artworks are "<a href="Cardsharps%20%28Caravaggio%29">Cardsharps</a>" by <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> (the backgammon board is in the lower left) and "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20Death">The Triumph of Death</a>" by <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> (the backgammon board is in the lower right). Others are the Hell of Bosch and interior of an Inn by Jan Steen.

In the 16th century, <a href="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> laws and church regulations prohibited playing tables, but by the 18th century, backgammon was popular among the English clergy. <a href="Edmund%20Hoyle">Edmund Hoyle</a> published "A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon" in 1753; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on <a href="whist">whist</a>.

In English, the word "backgammon" is most likely derived from "back" and <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> ""gamen"", meaning "game" or "play". The earliest use documented by the <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> was in 1650.

The most recent major development in backgammon was the addition of the doubling cube. It was first introduced in the 1920s in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> among members of gaming clubs in the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>. The cube required players not only to select the best move in a given position, but also to estimate the probability of winning from that position, transforming backgammon into the <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a>-driven game played in the 20th and 21st centuries.

The popularity of backgammon surged in the mid-1960s, in part due to the charisma of <a href="Prince%20Alexis%20Obolensky">Prince Alexis Obolensky</a> who became known as "The Father of Modern Backgammon". "Obe", as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association, which published a set of official rules. He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international backgammon tournament in March, 1964, which attracted royalty, celebrities and the press. The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men's clubs. People young and old all across the country dusted off their boards and checkers. Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments and <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> held backgammon parties at the <a href="Playboy%20Mansion">Playboy Mansion</a>. Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> in 1967.

Most recently, the United States Backgammon Federation (USBGF) was organized in 2009 to repopularize the game in the United States. Board and committee members include many of the top players, tournament directors and writers in the worldwide backgammon community. The USBGF has recently created a <a href="http%3A//usbgf.org/standards-of-ethical-practice/">Standards of Ethical Practice</a> to address issues on which tournament rules fail to touch.

pageRank.Book of Joshua

The pageRank.Book of Joshua ( "") is the sixth book in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> (the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>) and the first book of the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>, the story of Israel from the conquest of Canaan to the <a href="Babylonian%20exile">Babylonian exile</a>. It tells of the campaigns of the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> in central, southern and northern <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, the destruction of their enemies, and the division of the land among the <a href="Twelve%20Tribes%20of%20Israel">Twelve Tribes</a>, framed by two set-piece speeches, the first by God commanding the conquest of the land, and, at the end, the last by <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> warning of the need for faithful observance of the Law ("<a href="torah">torah</a>") revealed to <a href="Moses">Moses</a>.

Almost all scholars agree that the pageRank.Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early Israel and most likely reflects a much later period. Although <a href="Rabbinic%20Judaism">Rabbinic</a> tradition holds that the book was written by Joshua, it is probable that it was written by multiple authors and editors far removed from the times it depicts. The earliest parts of the book are possibly chapters 2–11, the story of the conquest; these chapters were later incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> (reigned 640–609 BCE), but the book was not completed until after the fall of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a> in 586 BCE, and possibly not until after the return from the <a href="Babylonian%20exile">Babylonian exile</a> in 539 BCE.

I. Transfer of leadership to Joshua (1:1–18)
II. Entrance into and conquest of Canaan (2:1–5:15)
III. Division of the land among the tribes (13:1–22:34)
IV. Conclusion (23:1–24:33)

Chapter 1 commences "after the death of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>" (Joshua 1:1) and presents the first of three important moments in Joshua marked with major speeches and reflections by the main characters; here first <a href="God">God</a>, and then <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a>, make speeches about the goal of conquest of the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a>; in chapter 12, the narrator looks back on the conquest; and in chapter 23 Joshua gives a speech about what must be done if <a href="Israelites">Israel</a> is to live in peace in the land.

Methodist writer <a href="Joseph%20Benson">Joseph Benson</a> suggests that God's revelation to Joshua comes "either immediately after [Moses' death], or when the <a href="Shiva%20%28Judaism%29">days of mourning</a> for Moses were expired".

God commissions Joshua to take possession of the land and warns him to keep faith with the Covenant. God's speech foreshadows the major themes of the book: the crossing of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a> and conquest of the land, its distribution, and the imperative need for obedience to the Law; Joshua's own immediate obedience is seen in his speeches to the Israelite commanders and to the <a href="Transjordan%20in%20the%20Bible">Transjordanian</a> tribes, and the Transjordanians' affirmation of Joshua's leadership echoes <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>'s assurances of victory.

The Israelites cross the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a> through the miraculous intervention of <a href="God">God</a> and the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. Then they are <a href="Circumcision%20in%20the%20Bible">circumcised</a> at <a href="Gilgal">Gibeath-Haaraloth</a> (translated as "hill of foreskins"), renamed <a href="Gilgal">Gilgal</a> in memory. "Gilgal" sounds like "Gallothi", "I have removed", but is more likely to translate as "circle of standing stones". The conquest begins in Canaan with <a href="battle%20of%20Jericho">Jericho</a>, followed by <a href="Ai%20%28Canaan%29">Ai</a> (central Canaan). After which Joshua builds an altar to Yahweh at <a href="Mount%20Ebal">Mount Ebal</a> (northern Canaan) and renews the <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">Covenant</a>. The covenant ceremony has elements of a divine land-grant ceremony, similar to ceremonies known from <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.

The narrative then switches to the south. The <a href="Gibeon%20%28ancient%20city%29">Gibeonites</a> trick the Israelites into entering an alliance with them by saying that they are not <a href="Canaan%23Hebrew_Bible">Canaanites</a>. This prevents the Israelites from exterminating them, but they are <a href="The%20Bible%20and%20slavery">enslaved</a> instead. An alliance of <a href="Amorites%23Biblical_Amorites">Amorite</a> kingdoms headed by the Canaanite king of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is defeated with <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>'s miraculous help of stopping the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, and hurling down large <a href="Hail">hailstones</a>. (Joshua 10:10-14) The enemy kings were eventually hanged on trees. The <a href="Deuteronomist">Deuteronomist</a> author may have used the then-recent 701 BCE campaign of the <a href="List%20of%20Assyrian%20kings">Assyrian king</a> <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> as his model; the hanging of the captured kings is in accordance with <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n practice of the 8th century BCE.

With the south conquered the narrative moves to the northern campaign. A powerful multi-national (or more accurately, multi-ethnic) coalition headed by the king of <a href="Tel%20Hazor">Hazor</a>, the most important northern city, is defeated with Yahweh's help. Hazor itself is then captured and destroyed. Chapter 11:16–23 summarises the extent of the conquest: Joshua has taken the entire land, almost entirely through military victories, with only the Gibeonites agreeing to peaceful terms with Israel. Joshua 11:18 asserts that the conquest took "a long time".

The land then "had rest from war" (Joshua 11:23, repeated at 14:15). Chapter 12 lists the vanquished kings on both sides of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>: the two kings who ruled east of the Jordan who were defeated under Moses' leadership (Joshua 12:1-6; cf. Numbers 21), and the 31 kings on the west of the Jordan who were defeated under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 12:7-24). The list of the 31 kings is quasi-tabular:

Having described how the Israelites and Joshua have carried out the first of their God's commands, the narrative now turns to the second: to "put the people in possession of the land." Joshua is "old, advanced (or stricken) in years" by this time (Joshua 13:1).

This land distribution is a "covenantal land grant": <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, as king, is issuing each <a href="Twelve%20Tribes%20of%20Israel">tribe</a> its territory. The "<a href="Cities%20of%20Refuge">Cities of Refuge</a>" and <a href="Levitical%20city">Levitical cities</a> are attached to the end, since it is necessary for the tribes to receive their grants before they allocate parts of it to others. The Transjordanian tribes are dismissed, affirming their loyalty to Yahweh.

The book reaffirms Moses' allocation of land east of the Jordan to the tribes of <a href="Tribe%20of%20Reuben">Reuben</a> and <a href="Tribe%20of%20Gad">Gad</a> and the half-tribe of <a href="Tribe%20of%20Manasseh">Manasseh</a> (Joshua 13:8-32; cf. ), and then describes how Joshua divided the newly conquered land of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> into parcels, and assigned them to the tribes by <a href="Land%20Lottery">lot</a>. Joshua 14:1 also makes reference to the role of <a href="Eleazar">Eleazar the priest</a> (ahead of Joshua) in the distribution process. The description serves a theological function to show how the <a href="Promised%20Land">promise of the land</a> was realized in the biblical narrative; its origins are unclear, but the descriptions may reflect geographical relations among the places named.

The wording of suggests that the tribes of Reuben, Gad, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Ephraim">Ephraim</a> and Manasseh received their land allocation some time before the "remaining seven tribes", and a 21-member expedition set out to survey the remainder of the land with a view to organising the allocation to the tribes of <a href="Tribe%20of%20Simeon">Simeon</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Benjamin">Benjamin</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Asher">Asher</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Naphtali">Naphtali</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Zebulun">Zebulun</a>, <a href="Tribe%20of%20Issachar">Issachar</a> and <a href="Tribe%20of%20Dan">Dan</a>. Subsequently, 48 <a href="Levitical%20city">cities</a> with their surrounding lands were allocated to the <a href="Tribe%20of%20Levi">Tribe of Levi</a> (, cf. ).

Omitted in the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>, but present in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, is a statement that:

By the end of chapter 21, the narrative records that the fulfilment of God's promise of land, rest and supremacy over the enemies of the Israelites was complete.(Joshua 21:43-45) The writer of the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Letter to the Hebrews</a> makes reference to Joshua and the promise of rest in . The tribes to whom Moses had granted land east of the Jordan are authorized to return home to <a href="Gilead">Gilead</a> (here used in the widest sense for the whole <a href="Transjordan%20in%20the%20Bible">Transjordan</a> district), having faithfully 'kept the charge' (Joshua 22:3, <a href="Revised%20Version">English Revised Version</a>) of supporting the tribes occupying Canaan. They are granted "riches ... with very much livestock, with <a href="silver">silver</a>, with <a href="gold">gold</a>, with <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, with <a href="iron">iron</a>, and with very much clothing" as a reward (Joshua 22:1-9).

Joshua, in his old age and conscious that he is "going the way of all the earth" (Joshua 23:14), gathers the leaders of the Israelites together, "perhaps at <a href="Timnath-heres">Timnath-serah</a>, or possibly at <a href="Shiloh%20%28biblical%20city%29">Shiloh</a>" and reminds them of Yahweh's great works for them, and of the need to love Yahweh (Joshua 23:11). The Israelites are told - just as Joshua himself had been told (Joshua 1:7) - that they must comply with "all that is written in the pageRank.Book of the Law of Moses" (Joshua 23:6), neither "turn[ing] aside from it to the right hand or to the left" (i.e. by adding to the law, or diminishing from it).

Joshua charges the people to remain faithful to Yahweh and the covenant, warning of judgment if (or when) Israel were to leave Yahweh and <a href="Apostasy%20in%20Judaism">follow other gods</a>. The hypothetical "if" is used in the <a href="New%20International%20Version">New International Version</a>, <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a>, <a href="Jerusalem%20Bible">Jerusalem Bible</a> and <a href="Common%20English%20Bible">Common English Bible</a>; the predictive "when" is used in the <a href="Geneva%20Bible">Geneva Bible</a>, <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> and <a href="New%20King%20James%20Version">New King James Version</a>.

Joshua meets again with all the people at <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> in chapter 24 and addresses them a second time. He recounts the history of God's formation of the Israelite nation, beginning with "<a href="Terah">Terah</a>, the father of <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a> and <a href="Nahor%2C%20son%20of%20Terah">Nahor</a>, [who] lived beyond the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates River</a> and worshiped other gods" (). He invited the Israelites to choose between serving the Lord who had delivered them from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, or the gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land they now lived. The people chose to serve the Lord, a decision which Joshua recorded in the pageRank.Book of the Law of God. He then erected a memorial stone "under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord" in Shechem (Joshua 24:1-27). The oak is associated with the Oak of <a href="Moreh">Moreh</a> where Abram had set up camp during his travels in this area (Genesis 12:6). Thus "Joshua made a covenant with the people", literally "cut a covenant", a phrase common to the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> languages. It derives from the custom of <a href="sacrifice">sacrifice</a>, in which the victims were cut in pieces and offered to the <a href="deity">deity</a> invoked in ratification of the engagement.

The people then returned to their inheritance i.e. their allocated lands (Joshua 24:28).

The pageRank.Book of Joshua closes with three concluding items (referred to in the Jerusalem Bible as "Two Additions"):

There were no Levitical cities given to the descendants of <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a> in Ephraim, so theologians <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Keil">Carl Friedrich Keil</a> and <a href="Franz%20Delitzsch">Franz Delitzsch</a> suppose the land may have been at <a href="Geba%20%28city%29">Geba</a> in the territory of the <a href="Tribe%20of%20Benjamin">Tribe of Benjamin</a>: "the situation, 'upon the mountains of Ephraim', is not at variance with this view, as these mountains extended, according to Judges 4:5, etc., far into the territory of Benjamin".

In some manuscripts and editions of the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, there is an additional verse relating to the apostasy of the Israelites after Joshua's death.

The pageRank.Book of Joshua is an <a href="anonymous%20work">anonymous work</a>. The <a href="Talmud%23Babylonian_Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a>, written in the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, was the first attempt to attach authors to the <a href="Religious%20text">holy books</a>. Each book, according to the authors of the Talmud, was written by a <a href="prophet">prophet</a>, and each prophet was an <a href="Eyewitness%20testimony">eyewitness</a> of the events described, and <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> himself wrote "the book that bears his name". This idea was rejected as untenable by <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> (1509–1564), and by the time of <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> (1588–1679) it was recognised that the book must have been written much later than the period it depicted. There is now general agreement that Joshua was composed as part of a larger work, the <a href="Deuteronomist%23Deuteronomistic_history">Deuteronomistic history</a>, stretching from the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">pageRank.Book of Deuteronomy</a> to the <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Books of Kings</a>.

In 1943 the German biblical scholar <a href="Martin%20Noth">Martin Noth</a> suggested that this history was composed by a single author/editor, living in the time of the Exile (6th century BCE). A major modification to Noth's theory was made in 1973 by the American scholar <a href="Frank%20M.%20Cross">Frank M. Cross</a>, to the effect that two editions of the history could be distinguished, the first and more important from the court of king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> in the late 7th century BCE, and the second Noth's 6th century BCE Exilic history. Later scholars have detected more authors or editors than either Noth or Cross allowed for.

The prevailing scholarly view is that Joshua is not a factual account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua is the 13th century BCE; this was a time of widespread city-destruction, but with a few exceptions (<a href="Tel%20Hazor">Hazor</a>, <a href="Tel%20Lachish">Lachish</a>) the destroyed cities are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua, and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time. Given its lack of historicity, Carolyn Pressler in her commentary for the "Westminster Bible Companion" series suggests that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message ("what passages teach about God") and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. <a href="Richard%20D.%20Nelson">Richard Nelson</a> explains: The needs of the <a href="Centralisation">centralised</a> monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an <a href="the%20Exodus">exodus from Egypt</a>, belief in a national god as "divine warrior," and explanations for ruined cities, <a href="social%20stratification">social stratification</a> and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.

In scholarship prior to the early 20th century academic scholarship, the historicity of the early Israelite campaigns was taken for granted (e.g., Paton). However, by the 1930s <a href="Martin%20Noth">Martin Noth</a> issued what <a href="William%20F.%20Albright">William F. Albright</a> termed "a sweeping criticism of the legitimacy of using biblical data in Joshua as material for history." Noth was a student of <a href="Albrecht%20Alt">Albrecht Alt</a>, who emphasized <a href="form%20criticism">form criticism</a> and the importance of <a href="Origin%20myth">etiology</a>. Alt and Noth posited a peaceful movement of the Israelites into various areas of Canaan, "<a href="Citation_signal%23Signals_that_indicate_contradiction">contra</a>" the Biblical account.

Albright himself questioned the "tenacity" of etiologies, which were key to Noth's analysis of the campaigns in Joshua. Archaeological evidence in the 1930s showed that the city of <a href="Ai%20%28Canaan%29">Ai</a>, an early target for conquest in the putative Joshua account, had existed and been destroyed, but in the 22nd century BCE. In 1951 <a href="Kathleen%20Kenyon">Kathleen Kenyon</a> showed that Jericho was from the <a href="Bronze_Age%23Age_sub-divisions">Middle Bronze Age</a> (c. 2100–1550 BCE), not the <a href="Bronze%20Age%23Age%20sub-divisions">Late Bronze Age</a> (c. 1550–1200 BCE). Kenyon argued that the early Israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated, but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the Israelite settlement.

In 1955, <a href="G.%20Ernest%20Wright">G. Ernest Wright</a> discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the pageRank.Book of Joshua. He pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that "seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country" (i.e., "a period of tremendous violence"). He gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at Hazor by <a href="Yigael%20Yadin">Yigael Yadin</a>.

As an alternative to both the military conquest and uncontested infiltration hypotheses, <a href="George%20Mendenhall">George Mendenhall</a> and <a href="Norman%20Gottwald">Norman Gottwald</a> suggested that the Israelites emerged through a kind of <a href="List%20of%20peasant%20revolts">peasant revolt</a> against their Canaanite lords. However, as explained by <a href="Gary%20A.%20Rendsburg">Gary A. Rendsburg</a>, archaeological findings (presented by <a href="Israel%20Finkelstein">Israel Finkelstein</a> in 1986) undermined this idea because the Israelites' first settled areas were not held by Canaanites, whose cities were sustained alongside Israelite areas.

Mainstream <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near East</a> scholarship holds that the pageRank.Book of Joshua holds little historical value. The archaeological evidence shows that <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a> and <a href="Ai%20%28Canaan%29">Ai</a> were not occupied in the Near Eastern <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age">Late Bronze Age</a>. The story of the conquest most likely represents the nationalist <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> of the 8th century BCE kings of <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> and their claims to the territory of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Kingdom of Israel</a>; incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> (reigned 640–609 BCE). The book was probably revised and completed after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">fall of Jerusalem</a> to the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a> in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the <a href="Babylonian%20exile">Babylonian exile</a> in 538 BCE.

The overarching theological theme of the Deuteronomistic history is faithfulness and God's mercy, and their opposites, faithlessness and God's wrath. In the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Judges">pageRank.Book of Judges</a>, the <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a>, and the <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Books of Kings</a>, the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> become faithless and God ultimately shows his anger by sending his people into exile. But in Joshua Israel is obedient, Joshua is faithful, and God fulfills his promise and gives them the land. Yahweh's war campaign in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> validates Israel's entitlement to the land and provides a paradigm of how Israel was to live there: twelve tribes, with a designated leader, united by <a href="covenant%20%28historical%29">covenant</a> in warfare and in worship of Yahweh alone at a single sanctuary, all in obedience to the commands of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> as found in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">pageRank.Book of Deuteronomy</a>.

The pageRank.Book of Joshua takes forward Deuteronomy's theme of Israel as a single people worshipping <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> in the land God has given them. Yahweh, as the main character in the book, takes the initiative in conquering the land, and Yahweh's power wins the battles. For example, the walls of <a href="Jericho">Jericho</a> fall because Yahweh fights for Israel, not because the Israelites show superior fighting ability. The potential disunity of Israel is a constant theme, the greatest threat of disunity coming from the tribes east of the Jordan. Chapter 22:19 even hints that the land across the Jordan is unclean and that the tribes who live there have secondary status.

Land is the central topic of Joshua. The introduction to Deuteronomy recalled how Yahweh had given the land to the Israelites but then withdrew the gift when Israel showed fear and only Joshua and <a href="Caleb">Caleb</a> had trusted in God. The land is Yahweh's to give or withhold, and the fact that he has promised it to Israel gives Israel an inalienable right to take it. For <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">exilic</a> and <a href="Second%20Temple%20period">post-exilic</a> readers, the land was both the sign of Yahweh's faithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness, as well as the centre of their ethnic identity. In Deuteronomistic theology, "rest" meant Israel's unthreatened possession of the land, the achievement of which began with the conquests of Joshua.

Joshua "carries out a systematic campaign against the civilians of Canaan — men, women and children — that amounts to <a href="genocide">genocide</a>." In doing this he is carrying out "<a href="herem%20%28war%20or%20property%29">herem</a>" as commanded by Yahweh in Deuteronomy 20:17: "You shall not leave alive anything that breathes". The purpose is to drive out and dispossess the Canaanites, with the implication that there are to be no <a href="Treaty">treaties</a> with the enemy, no <a href="mercy">mercy</a>, and no <a href="Exogamy">intermarriage</a>. "The extermination of the nations glorifies Yahweh as a warrior and promotes Israel's claim to the land," while their continued survival "explores the themes of disobedience and penalty and looks forward to the story told in Judges and Kings." The divine call for massacre at <a href="Battle%20of%20Jericho">Jericho</a> and elsewhere can be explained in terms of cultural norms (Israel was not the only <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> state to practice "herem") and theology (a measure to ensure Israel's purity as well as the fulfillment of God's promise), but <a href="Patrick%20D.%20Miller">Patrick D. Miller</a> in his commentary on Deuteronomy remarks, "there is no real way to make such reports palatable to the hearts and minds of contemporary readers and believers."

Obedience versus disobedience is a constant theme of the work. Obedience ties in the Jordan crossing, the defeat of Jericho and <a href="Ai%20%28Canaan%29">Ai</a>, circumcision and Passover, and the public display and reading of the Law. Disobedience appears in the story of <a href="Achan%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Achan</a> (<a href="Stoning">stoned</a> for violating the "herem" command), the <a href="Gibeon%20%28ancient%20city%29">Gibeonites</a>, and the altar built by the Transjordan tribes. Joshua's two final addresses challenge the Israel of the future (the readers of the story) to obey the most important command of all, to worship Yahweh and no other gods. Joshua thus illustrates the central Deuteronomistic message, that obedience leads to success and disobedience to ruin.

The Deuteronomistic history draws parallels in proper leadership between <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, Joshua and <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>. God's commission to Joshua in chapter 1 is framed as a royal installation. The people's pledge of loyalty to Joshua as the successor of Moses recalls royal practices. The covenant-renewal ceremony led by Joshua was the prerogative of the kings of Judah. God's command to Joshua to meditate on the "book of the law" day and night parallels the description of Josiah in 2 Kings 23:25 as a king uniquely concerned with the study of the law. The two figures had identical territorial goals; Josiah died in 609 BCE while attempting to annex the former Israel to his own kingdom of Judah.

Some of the parallels with Moses can be seen in the following, and not exhaustive, list:

With the <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> struggle for a <a href="Jewish%20state">Jewish state</a>, the early Israelite campaigns have undergone renewed attention and interpretation. The early Zionists, according to <a href="Rachel%20Havrelock">Rachel Havrelock</a>, "read the book of Joshua as explaining their times and justifying their wars. From this perspective, God fought on behalf of manifest Israel... Joshua’s vocabulary informed the lexicon of Jewish nationalism." 

Later, in 1958, <a href="David%20Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> "saw the biblical war narrative as constituting an ideal basis for a unifying <a href="myth">myth</a> of national identity." This was a unity that was framed against a common enemy, the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> beyond Israel's borders. Ben-Gurion met with politicians and scholars, such as Bible scholar <a href="Shemaryahu%20Talmon">Shemaryahu Talmon</a>, to discuss the conquests in Joshua. He later published a book of the meeting transcripts. In a lecture at Ben-Gurion's home, archaeologist <a href="Yigael%20Yadin">Yigael Yadin</a> argued for the historicity of the Israelite military campaign and remarked on how much easier it was for military experts to appreciate the plausibility of the Joshua narrative. Yadin specifically pointed to the conquests of <a href="Tel%20Hazor">Hazor</a>, <a href="Bethel">Bethel</a>, and <a href="Lachish">Lachish</a>. Conversely, archaeologist <a href="Yohanan%20Aharoni">Yohanan Aharoni</a> argued against the historicity of the early Israelite campaigns, instead favoring a migration model.

Rachel Havrelock herself argues that the myth of conquest, although shaped by ardent nationalists with a military agenda, could be re-interpreted for the purposes of a decentralized post-nationalism.

By the same token, the Biblical narrative of conquest has been used as an apparatus of critique against Zionism. For example, Michael Prior criticizes the use of the campaign in Joshua to favor "colonial enterprises" (in general, not only Zionism) and have been interpreted as validating <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>. He asserts that the Bible was used to make the treatment of <a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a> more palatable morally. A related moral condemnation can be seen in "The political sacralization of imperial genocide: contextualizing Timothy Dwight's "The Conquest of Canaan"" by Bill Templer. This kind of critique is not new; <a href="Jonathan%20Boyarin">Jonathan Boyarin</a> notes how <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Turner">Frederick W. Turner</a> blamed Israel's <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a> for the very idea of genocide, which Boyarin found "simplistic" yet with precedents.

pageRank.Book of Ezra

The pageRank.Book of Ezra is a book of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. Originally combined with the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Nehemiah">pageRank.Book of Nehemiah</a> in a single book of <a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a>, the two became separated in the early centuries of the Christian era. Its subject is the <a href="Return%20to%20Zion">Return to Zion</a> following the close of the <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Babylonian captivity</a>, and it is divided into two parts, the first telling the story of the first return of exiles in the first year of <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> (538 BC) and the completion and dedication of the new <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> in the sixth year of <a href="Darius%20I%20of%20Persia">Darius I</a> (515 BC), the second telling of the subsequent mission of <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> to Jerusalem and his struggle to purify the Jews from what the book calls the sin of marriage with non-Jews. Together with the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Nehemiah">pageRank.Book of Nehemiah</a>, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.

Ezra is written to fit a schematic pattern in which the God of Israel inspires a <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Persia">king of Persia</a> to commission a leader from the Jewish community to carry out a mission; three successive leaders carry out three such missions, the first rebuilding the Temple, the second purifying the Jewish community, and the third sealing of the holy city itself behind a wall. (This last mission, that of <a href="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a>, is not part of the pageRank.Book of Ezra.) The theological program of the book explains the many problems its chronological structure presents. It probably appeared in its earliest version around 399 BC, and continued to be revised and edited for several centuries before being accepted as scriptural in the early Christian era.

The pageRank.Book of Ezra consists of ten chapters: chapters 1–6, covering the period from the <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great%20in%20the%20Bible">Cyrus the Great</a> to the dedication of the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a>, are told in the third person; chapters 7–10, dealing with the mission of Ezra, are told largely in the first person. The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions, written in <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> while the surrounding text is in <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> (1:2-4, 4:8-16, 4:17-22, 5:7-17, 6:3-5, 6:6-12, 7:12-26)



In the early 6th century BC, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> rebelled against the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a> and was destroyed. As a result, the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes were taken into captivity in the city of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>. There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and rebuild the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a>. The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of <a href="great%20power">great power</a>, and in 539 BC <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus II</a>, the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon.

It is difficult to describe the parties and politics of <a href="Judea">Judea</a> in this period because of the lack of historical sources, but there seem to have been three important groups involved: the returnees from the exile who claimed the reconstruction with the support of <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus I</a>; "the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin"; and a third group, "people of the land", who seem to be local opposition against the returnees building the Temple in Jerusalem.

The following table is a guide to major events in the region during the period covered by the pageRank.Book of Ezra:

The oldest texts of the Bible treat Ezra-plus-Nehemiah as a single book (<a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a>). It was divided into two separate works by the time of the 3rd-century Christian scholar <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, and the separation became entrenched in Christian Bibles in the Western European tradition when this was followed by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> in his <a href="Vulgate">Latin translation</a>. It was not until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> that the two became separated in Jewish Bibles.

<a href="1%20Esdras">1 Esdras</a>, also known as "Esdras <a href="Alpha">α</a>", is an alternate Greek-language version of Ezra. This text has one additional section (and related changes) in the middle of Ezra 4. The addition arranges the text around a <a href="chiastic%20structure">chiastic structure</a> and relieves a textual problem surrounding the identity of King <a href="Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a> in Ezra 4:6. Although the content is substantially the same, the verses are numbered differently from Ezra.

The contents of Ezra–Nehemiah are structured in a theological rather than chronological order: "The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law."

The "plot" follows a repeating pattern in which the God of Israel "stirs up" the king of Persia to commission a Jewish leader (Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah) to undertake a mission; the leader completes his mission in the face of opposition; and success is marked by a great assembly. The tasks of the three leaders are progressive: first the Temple is restored (Zerubabbel), then the community of Israel (Ezra), and finally the walls which will separate the purified community and Temple from the outside world (Nehemiah). The pattern is completed with a final coda in which Nehemiah restores the belief of Yahweh. This concern with a schematic pattern-making, rather than with history in the modern sense of a factual account of events in the order in which they occurred, explains the origin of the many problems which surround both Ezra and Nehemiah as historical sources.

Twentieth-century views on the composition of Ezra revolved around whether the author was <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> himself (and who may have also authored the <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">Books of Chronicles</a>) or was another author or authors (who also wrote the Chronicles). More recently it has been increasingly recognised that Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles all have extremely complex histories stretching over many stages of editing, and most scholars now are cautious of assuming a unified composition with a single theology and point of view. As an indication of the many layers of editing which Ezra has undergone, one recent study finds that Ezra 1–6 and Ezra 9–10 were originally separate documents, that they were spliced together at a later stage by the authors of Ezra 7–8, and that all have undergone extensive later editing.

Most scholars date the work to the fourth century BCE. The events described in Ezra-Nehemiah are mostly dated to the fifth century BCE, and <a href="Darius%20II">Darius II</a>'s (423-405) being mentioned (Neh. 12:22) would appear to support an early fourth-century BCE date for the work's completion and compilation. Other details from the late fourth century BCE are missing.

There is general recognition, however, that the editing of the book continued well into the <a href="Hellenistic%20era">Hellenistic era</a>. The question of when the core of the book originated depends in the first place on the dates assigned to <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> himself (assuming him to have been a historic person). The only clue to go by is the note in Ezra 7:7–8 that he arrived in Jerusalem in "the seventh year of Artaxerxes." Unfortunately there were three kings of this name and the text does not specify which one. The traditional date, and currently the most popular candidate, is 458 BC, based on the assumption that the king is <a href="Artaxerxes%20I">Artaxerxes I</a>. A date of 398 BC, based on the possibility that the king might be <a href="Artaxerxes%20II">Artaxerxes II</a>, was once popular but has been seriously challenged in recent scholarship. A date of 428 BC, based on the idea that the "seventh" year of Artaxerxes is a mistake for "thirty-seventh" year, has become less popular, as it is based entirely on conjecture.

Seven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra. Their authenticity has been contentious; while some scholars accept them in their current form, most accept only part of them as genuine, while still others reject them entirely. L.L. Grabbe surveys six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concludes that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them.

pageRank.Book of Daniel

The pageRank.Book of Daniel is a biblical <a href="apocalypse">apocalypse</a>, combining a prophecy of history with an <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a> (the study of last things) which is both cosmic in scope and political in its focus. It is "an account of the activities and visions of <a href="Daniel%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Daniel</a>, a noble <a href="Jews">Jew</a> <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">exiled at Babylon</a>." In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> it is found in the "<a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>" (writings), while in <a href="Christian%20biblical%20canons">Christian Bibles</a> it is grouped with the <a href="Major%20prophet">Major Prophet</a>s. The book divides into two parts, a set of six court tales in chapters 1–6 followed by four apocalyptic visions in chapters 7–12. The <a href="Deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanon</a> contains three additional stories, the <a href="The%20Prayer%20of%20Azariah%20and%20Song%20of%20the%20Three%20Holy%20Children">Song of the Three Holy Children</a>, <a href="Susanna%20%28Book%20of%20Daniel%29">Susanna</a>, and <a href="Bel%20and%20the%20Dragon">Bel and the Dragon</a>. Its message is that just as the <a href="Yahweh">God of Israel</a> saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all of <a href="History%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">Israel</a> in their present oppression.

Though the book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel himself, modern scholarly consensus considers it <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ous, the stories of the first half legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the <a href="Maccabees">Maccabean</a> period (2nd century BC). Its influence has resonated through later ages, from the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> community and the authors of the <a href="gospel">gospel</a>s and <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">Revelation</a>, to various movements from the 2nd century to the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> and modern <a href="Millennialism">millennial</a>ist movements – on which it continues to have a profound influence.

The pageRank.Book of Daniel is divided between the court tales of chapters 1–6 and the apocalyptic visions of 7–12, and between the <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Hebrew</a> of chapters 1 and 8–12, and the <a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Aramaic</a> of chapters 2–7. This language division is reinforced by the <a href="Chiastic%20structure">chiastic</a> arrangement of the Aramaic chapters (see below). Various suggestions have been made by scholars to explain the fact that the genre division does not coincide with the other two. However, the most reasonable proposal is that put forward by <a href="John%20J.%20Collins">John J. Collins</a>: the language division and concentric structure of chapters 2-6 are artificial literary devices designed to bind the two halves of the book together. It should also be noted that the time settings of chapters 1–6 show a progression from Babylonian to <a href="Media%20%28region%29">Median times</a>, which is repeated (Babylonian to Persian) in chapters 7–12. The following outline is provided by Collins in his commentary on Daniel:

PART I: Tales (chapters 1:1–6:29)
PART II: Visions (chapters 7:1–12:13)

There is a clear <a href="chiasmus">chiasm</a> (a concentric literary structure in which the main point of a passage is often placed in the centre and framed by parallel elements on either side in "ABBA" fashion) in the chapter arrangement of the Aramaic section. The following is taken from Paul Redditt's "Introduction to the Prophets":


In the third year of King <a href="Jehoiakim">Jehoiakim</a>, God allows Jerusalem to fall into the power of <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>, king of <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20empire">Babylon</a>. Young Israelites of noble and royal family, "without physical defect, and handsome," versed in wisdom and competent to serve in the palace of the king, are taken to Babylon to be taught the literature and language of the <a href="Babylon">Chaldeans</a>. Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine. Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water. They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams. When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them 'ten times better' than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus</a>.

In the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream. When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men. Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream. Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it. When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death. Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth. Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon.

Daniel's companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar's golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace. Nebuchadnezzar is astonished to see a fourth figure in the furnace with the three, one "with the appearance like a son of the gods." So the king called the three to come out of the fire, and blessed the God of Israel, and decreed that any who blasphemed against him should be torn limb from limb.

Nebuchadnezzar recounts a dream of a huge tree that is suddenly cut down at the command of a heavenly messenger. Daniel is summoned and interprets the dream. The tree is Nebuchadnezzar himself, who for seven years will lose his mind and live like a wild beast. All of this comes to pass until, at the end of the specified time, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that "heaven rules" and his kingdom and sanity are restored.

<a href="Belshazzar">Belshazzar</a> and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a hand mysteriously appears and <a href="The%20writing%20on%20the%20wall">writes upon the wall</a>. The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids him for his lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar's kingdom will be given to the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> and <a href="Achaemenid%20empire">Persians</a>. Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to be third in the kingdom, and that very night Belshazzar is slain and <a href="Darius%20the%20Mede">Darius the Mede</a> takes the kingdom.

Darius elevates Daniel to high office, exciting the jealousy of other officials. Knowing of Daniel's devotion to his God, his enemies trick the king into issuing an edict forbidding worship of any other god or man for a 30-day period. Daniel continues to pray three times a day to God towards Jerusalem; he is accused and King Darius, forced by his own decree, throws Daniel into the lions' den. But God shuts up the mouths of the lions, and the next morning Darius rejoices to find him unharmed. The king casts Daniel's accusers into the lions' pit together with their wives and children to be instantly devoured, while he himself acknowledges Daniel's God as he whose kingdom shall never be destroyed.

In the first year of <a href="Belshazzar">Belshazzar</a> Daniel has a dream of four monstrous beasts arising from the sea. The fourth, a beast with ten horns, devours the whole earth, treading it down and crushing it, and a further small horn appears and uproots three of the earlier horns. The <a href="Ancient%20of%20Days">Ancient of Days</a> judges and destroys the beast, and "one like a <a href="son%20of%20man">son of man</a>" is given everlasting kingship over the entire world. A divine being explains that the four beasts represent four kings, but that "the holy ones of the Most High" would receive the everlasting kingdom. The fourth beast would be a fourth kingdom with ten kings, and another king who would pull down three kings and make war on the "holy ones" for "a time, two times and a half," after which the heavenly judgement will be made against him and the "holy ones" will receive the everlasting kingdom.

In the third year of Belshazzar Daniel has vision of a ram and goat. The ram has two mighty horns, one longer than the other, and it charges west, north and south, overpowering all other beasts. A goat with a single horn appears from the west and destroys the ram. The goat becomes very powerful until the horn breaks off and is replaced by four lesser horns. A small horn that grows very large, it stops the daily temple sacrifices and desecrates the sanctuary for two thousand three hundred "evening and mornings" (which could be either 1150 or 2300 days) until the temple is cleansed. The <a href="angel%20Gabriel">angel Gabriel</a> informs him that the ram represents the Medes and Persians, the goat is Greece, and the "little horn" is a wicked king.

In the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel meditates on the word of <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years; he confesses the sin of Israel and pleads for God to restore Israel and the "desolated sanctuary" of the Temple. The angel <a href="Gabriel">Gabriel</a> explains that the seventy years stand for seventy "weeks" of years (490 years), during which the Temple will first be restored, then later defiled by a "prince who is to come," "until the decreed end is poured out."

Daniel 10: In the third year of <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus</a> Daniel sees in his vision an angel (called "a man", but clearly a supernatural being) who explains that he is in the midst of a war with the "prince of Persia", assisted only by <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Michael</a>, "your prince." The "prince of Greece" will shortly come, but first he will reveal what will happen to Daniel's people.

Daniel 11: A future king of Persia will make war on the king of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a>, a "mighty king" will arise and wield power until his empire is broken up and given to others, and finally the king of the south (identified in verse 8 as <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>) will go to war with the "king of the north." After many battles (described in great detail) a "contemptible person" will become king of the north; this king will invade the south two times, the first time with success, but on his second he will be stopped by "ships of Kittim." He will turn back to his own country, and on the way his soldiers will desecrate the Temple, abolish the daily sacrifice, and set up the <a href="abomination%20of%20desolation">abomination of desolation</a>. He will defeat and subjugate <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> and Egypt, but "reports from the east and north will alarm him," and he will meet his end "between the sea and the holy mountain."

Daniel 12: At this time Michael will come. It will be a time of great distress, but all those whose names are written will be delivered. "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt; those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever." In the final verses the remaining time to the end is revealed: "a time, times and half a time" (three years and a half). Daniel fails to understand and asks again what will happen, and is told: "From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days. Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days."

The Greek text of Daniel is considerably longer than the Hebrew, due to three additional stories: they were accepted by all branches of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> until the Protestant movement rejected them in the 16th century on the basis that they were absent from Hebrew Bibles, but remain in <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> Bibles.

The visions of chapters 7–12 reflect the crisis which took place in Judea in 167–164 BC when <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a>, the Greek king of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem. When Antiochus came to the throne the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid. The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked – or more accurately, paid – to be allowed to make Jerusalem a "<a href="polis">polis</a>", or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.

Antiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BC with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans. Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood. Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish pageRank.Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 an "abomination of desolation", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple. With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple.

The crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the destruction of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BC (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase "evenings and mornings" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices. But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate (chapter 11:21–29), the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40–43) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44–45) was inaccurate (he died in Persia). The conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem.

It is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations. The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BC. When the full collection was assembled, it is likely that the brief Aramaic introduction of chapter 1 was composed to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon. In the third stage the visions of chapters 7–12 were added and chapter 1 was translated into Hebrew.

Daniel is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them pseudonymous. Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, chapters 1–6 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; only the second half (chapters 7–12) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10. The real author/editor of Daniel was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community. The book is a product of "Wisdom" circles, but the type of wisdom is (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning – the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation.

It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and <a href="Job%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Job</a> (<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>. "The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character ... serves as the principal human "hero" in the biblical book that now bears his name"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries.

The prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a>, king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BC), the desecration of the Temple (the "abomination of desolation"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164. Chapters 10–12 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BC. There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again.

Further evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's <a href="Nevi%27im">canon of the prophets</a>, which was closed around 200 BC, and the Wisdom of <a href="Sirach">Sirach</a>, a work dating from around 180 BC, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it. Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the <a href="Sibylline%20Oracles">Sibylline Oracles</a> commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BC, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known and revered from the middle of that century.

The pageRank.Book of Daniel is preserved in the twelve-chapter <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> and in two longer Greek versions, the original <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> version, c. 100 BC, and the later <a href="Theodotion">Theodotion</a> version from c. 2nd century AD. Both Greek texts contain three <a href="additions%20to%20Daniel">additions to Daniel</a>: <a href="The%20Prayer%20of%20Azariah%20and%20Song%20of%20the%20Three%20Holy%20Children">The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children</a>; the story of <a href="Susanna%20%28Book%20of%20Daniel%29">Susannah and the Elders</a>; and the story of <a href="Bel%20and%20the%20Dragon">Bel and the Dragon</a>. Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself. The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text.

A total of eight incomplete copies of the pageRank.Book of Daniel have been found at <a href="Qumran">Qumran</a>, two in <a href="Qumran%20Caves">Cave 1</a>, five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6. None is complete, but between them they preserve text from eleven of Daniel's twelve chapters, and the twelfth is quoted in the <a href="Florilegium">Florilegium</a> (a compilation scroll) 4Q174, showing that the book at Qumran did not lack this conclusion. All eight manuscripts were copied between 125 BC (4QDan) and about 50 AD (4QDan), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only forty years after its composition. All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text. None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan, 4QDan, 4QDan, and 4QDan) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, switches to <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1.

"(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)"

The pageRank.Book of Daniel is an <a href="apocalypse">apocalypse</a> - a representative of a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and <a href="pseudonymity">pseudonymity</a> (false authorship). The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BC to 100 AD, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, Persians and <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a>. Daniel, the book's hero, is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of the divine revelation: he has learned the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge; he is one of the <a href="maskil%20%28honorific%29">"maskil"</a>, the wise, who have the task of teaching righteousness.

The account is also an <a href="eschatology">eschatology</a>: the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom. The pageRank.Book of Daniel gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and on those Jews who cooperated with them.

The message of the pageRank.Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression. The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament – "the Son of God", "the Son of Man", Christ and the Antichrist - the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BCE. The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.


The concepts of <a href="immortality">immortality</a> and <a href="resurrection">resurrection</a>, with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt." Without this belief, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, in which the <a href="resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection of Jesus</a> plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century.

Daniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians the 1st century AD as predicting the imminent end-time. Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the <a href="Montanism">Montanists</a> of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their <a href="millennialism">millennialism</a>, to the more extreme elements of the 16th century Reformation such as the <a href="Zwickau%20prophets">Zwickau prophets</a> and the <a href="M%C3%BCnster%20Rebellion">Münster Rebellion</a>. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, the <a href="Fifth%20Monarchists">Fifth Monarchy Men</a> took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> allow them to form a "government of saints" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus. Daniel remains one of the most influential apocalypses in modern America, foretelling the history of Jesus and the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a>.

The influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel. More recently the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í</a> movement, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1,260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the <a href="Muhammad%20al-Mahdi">Twelfth Imam</a> and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the <a href="Hijri%20year">Muslim era</a>.

Daniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophesy but as a historical book, "a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man". In the early modern period the physicist <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> paid special attention to it, and <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> borrowed a <a href="motto">motto</a> from it for his work "<a href="Novum%20Organum">Novum Organum</a>". Philosophers, such as <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a>. Artists including <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a> have all drawn on its imagery.

Batman

Batman is a fictional <a href="superhero">superhero</a> appearing in <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a>s published by <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>. The character was created by artist <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> and writer <a href="Bill%20Finger">Bill Finger</a>, and first appeared in "<a href="Detective%20Comics">Detective Comics</a>" #27 (1939). Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the <a href="Dark%20Knight%20%28nickname%29">Dark Knight</a>, and the World's Greatest Detective.

Batman's <a href="secret%20identity">secret identity</a> is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American <a href="playboy%20%28lifestyle%29">playboy</a>, <a href="philanthropy">philanthropist</a>, and owner of <a href="Wayne%20Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>. After witnessing the murder of his parents <a href="Thomas%20Wayne">Dr. Thomas Wayne</a> and <a href="Martha%20Wayne">Martha Wayne</a> as a child, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a <a href="Batsuit">bat-inspired</a> persona to fight crime.

Batman operates in the fictional <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred</a>, police commissioner <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">Gordon</a>, and vigilante allies such as <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a>. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any <a href="Superpower%20%28ability%29">superpowers</a>; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's <a href="List%20of%20Batman%20Family%20adversaries">rogues gallery</a>, including his <a href="archenemy">archenemy</a>, the <a href="Joker%20%28character%29">Joker</a>.

The character became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>", the following year. As the decades went on, differing interpretations of the character emerged. The late 1960s "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>" television series used a <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended. Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots, culminating in 1986 with "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>" by <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>. The success of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>' live-action <a href="Batman%20in%20film">"Batman" feature films</a> have helped maintain the public's interest in the character.

An American cultural icon, Batman has been licensed and adapted into a <a href="Batman%20franchise%20media">variety of media</a>, from radio to television and film, and appears on various merchandise sold all over the world, such as toys and video games. The character has also intrigued psychiatrists, with many trying to understand the character's psyche. In 2015, <a href="Time%20Inc.">FanSided</a> ranked Batman as number one on their list of "50 Greatest Super Heroes In Comic pageRank.Book History". <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Greenwood">Bruce Greenwood</a>, <a href="Peter%20Weller">Peter Weller</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Ruivivar">Anthony Ruivivar</a>, <a href="Jason%20O%27Mara">Jason O'Mara</a>, and <a href="Will%20Arnett">Will Arnett</a>, among others, have provided the character's voice for animated adaptations. Batman has been depicted in both film and television by <a href="Lewis%20Wilson">Lewis Wilson</a>, <a href="Robert%20Lowery%20%28actor%29">Robert Lowery</a>, <a href="Adam%20West">Adam West</a>, <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a>, <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a>, <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Affleck">Ben Affleck</a>.
In early 1939, the success of <a href="Superman">Superman</a> in "<a href="Action%20Comics">Action Comics</a>" prompted editors at <a href="National%20Comics%20Publications">National Comics Publications</a> (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> created "the Bat-Man". Collaborator <a href="Bill%20Finger">Bill Finger</a> recalled that "Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings. I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small <a href="domino%20mask">domino mask</a>, swinging on a rope. He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings. And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN". The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired by <a href="Leonardo%20Da%20Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>'s sketch of an <a href="ornithopter">ornithopter</a> flying device as a child.

Finger suggested giving the character a <a href="cowl">cowl</a> instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume. Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: "Bruce Wayne's first name came from <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Scotland">Robert Bruce</a>, the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry. I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Mad Anthony Wayne</a>." He later said his suggestions were influenced by <a href="Lee%20Falk">Lee Falk</a>'s popular "<a href="The%20Phantom">The Phantom</a>", a <a href="Print%20syndication">syndicated</a> newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar.

Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry. Details find predecessors in <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a>, <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a>s, <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a> headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself. As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in <a href="the%20Scarlet%20Pimpernel">the Scarlet Pimpernel</a> (created by <a href="Baroness%20Emmuska%20Orczy">Baroness Emmuska Orczy</a>, 1903) and <a href="Zorro">Zorro</a> (created by <a href="Johnston%20McCulley">Johnston McCulley</a>, 1919). Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane noted the influence of the films "<a href="The%20Mark%20of%20Zorro%20%281920%20film%29">The Mark of Zorro</a>" (1920) and "<a href="The%20Bat%20Whispers">The Bat Whispers</a>" (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like <a href="Doc%20Savage">Doc Savage</a>, <a href="The%20Shadow">The Shadow</a>, <a href="Dick%20Tracy">Dick Tracy</a>, and <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, made the character a master sleuth.

In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation:

Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say "Batman created by Bob Kane"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when <a href="Jerry%20Siegel">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href="Joe%20Shuster">Joe Shuster</a> began receiving a "created by" credit on the Superman titles, along with <a href="William%20Moulton%20Marston">William Moulton Marston</a> being given the byline for creating <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, Batman stories began saying "Created by Bob Kane" in addition to the other credits.

Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of "Batman" #169 (February 1965) for example, editor <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> names him as the creator of the <a href="Riddler">Riddler</a>, one of Batman's recurring villains. However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline. Kane wrote, "Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career. He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by." At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator.

<a href="Jerry%20Robinson">Jerry Robinson</a>, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit. He recalled Finger resenting his position, stating in a 2005 interview with "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>":
Although Kane initially rebutted Finger's claims at having created the character, writing in a 1965 open letter to fans that "it seemed to me that Bill Finger has given out the impression that he and not myself created the <nowiki>"</nowiki>Batman, t' as well as Robin and all the other leading villains and characters. This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue." Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'. However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator."

In 1989, Kane revisited Finger's situation, recalling in an interview: 

In September 2015, <a href="DC%20Entertainment">DC Entertainment</a> revealed that Finger would be receiving credit for his role in Batman's creation on the 2016 superhero film "" and the second season of "<a href="Gotham%20%28TV%20series%29">Gotham</a>" after a deal was worked out between the Finger family and DC. Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with "Batman and Robin Eternal" #3 and "Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis" #3. The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as "Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger".

The first Batman story, "<a href="The%20Case%20of%20the%20Chemical%20Syndicate">The Case of the Chemical Syndicate</a>", was published in "Detective Comics" #27 (May 1939). Finger said, "Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps", and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals. Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in "Detective Comics". By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success. The two characters were featured side-by-side as the stars of "<a href="World%27s%20Finest%20Comics">World's Finest Comics</a>", which was originally titled "World's Best Comics" when it debuted in fall 1940. Creators including <a href="Jerry%20Robinson">Jerry Robinson</a> and <a href="Dick%20Sprang">Dick Sprang</a> also worked on the strips during this period.

Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved. Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman", Kane said. <a href="Batman%27s%20utility%20belt">Batman's characteristic utility belt</a> was introduced in "Detective Comics" #29 (July 1939), followed by the <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a>-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the <a href="Batplane">Batplane</a>, in #31 (Sept. 1939). The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents. Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger. Days later, at their grave, the child vows that "by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals".

The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in "Detective Comics" #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a>, Batman's junior counterpart. Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a "<a href="Dr.%20Watson">Watson</a>" with whom Batman could talk. Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of "kid sidekicks". The first issue of the solo spin-off series "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the <a href="Joker%20%28character%29">Joker</a> and <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, but for a story in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death. That story prompted editor <a href="Whitney%20Ellsworth">Whitney Ellsworth</a> to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun.

By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos. In the years following World War II, DC Comics "adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy". The impact of this editorial approach was evident in "Batman" comics of the postwar period; removed from the "bleak and menacing world" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a "bright and colorful" environment.

Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s. In the story "The Mightiest Team in the World" in "<a href="Superman%20%28comic%20book%29">Superman</a>" #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity. Following the success of this story, "World's Finest Comics" was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before. The team-up of the characters was "a financial success in an era when those were few and far between"; this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986.

Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist <a href="Fredric%20Wertham">Fredric Wertham</a>'s book "<a href="Seduction%20of%20the%20Innocent">Seduction of the Innocent</a>" in 1954. Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers. Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the <a href="Comics%20Code%20Authority">Comics Code Authority</a>, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry. The tendency towards a "sunnier Batman" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code. Scholars have suggested that the characters of <a href="Batwoman">Batwoman</a> (in 1956) and the pre-<a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a> <a href="Bette%20Kane">Bat-Girl</a> (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel.

In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre. New characters such as Batwoman, <a href="Ace%20the%20Bat-Hound">Ace the Bat-Hound</a>, and <a href="Bat-Mite">Bat-Mite</a> were introduced. Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens. In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the <a href="Justice%20League">Justice League of America</a> in "<a href="The%20Brave%20and%20the%20Bold">The Brave and the Bold</a>" #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic series starting later that same year.

By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically. Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was "planning to kill Batman off altogether". In response to this, editor <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a> was assigned to the Batman titles. He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's "Detective Comics" #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the "New Look". Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist <a href="Carmine%20Infantino">Carmine Infantino</a> to help overhaul the character. The <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>.

The debut of the "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>" television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character. The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and "Batman" reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies. Elements such as the character of <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> and the show's <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred. Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again. As Julius Schwartz noted, "When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books."

Starting in 1969, writer <a href="Dennis%20O%27Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a> and artist <a href="Neal%20Adams">Neal Adams</a> made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a "grim avenger of the night". O'Neil said his idea was "simply to take it back to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after."

O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20the%20Waiting%20Graves">The Secret of the Waiting Graves</a>" in "Detective Comics" #395 (January 1970). Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker <a href="Dick%20Giordano">Dick Giordano</a>, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was "tremendous". Giordano said: "We went back to a grimmer, darker Batman, and I think that's why these stories did so well ..." While the work of O'Neil and Adams was popular with fans, the acclaim did little to improve declining sales; the same held true with a similarly acclaimed run by writer <a href="Steve%20Englehart">Steve Englehart</a> and penciler <a href="Marshall%20Rogers">Marshall Rogers</a> in "Detective Comics" #471–476 (August 1977 – April 1978), which went on to influence the 1989 movie "Batman" and be adapted for "", which debuted in 1992. Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985.

<a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>'s limited series "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>" (February–June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone. The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated the character. "The Dark Knight Returns" was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones. The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity.

That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries "<a href="Crisis%20on%20Infinite%20Earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>". O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before. One outcome of this new approach was the "" storyline in "Batman" #404–407 (February–May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist <a href="David%20Mazzucchelli">David Mazzucchelli</a> redefined the character's origins. Writer <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> and artist <a href="Brian%20Bolland">Brian Bolland</a> continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page <a href="one-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> "", in which the Joker, attempting to drive <a href="Commissioner%20Gordon">Commissioner Gordon</a> insane, cripples Gordon's daughter <a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Barbara</a>, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically.

The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a <a href="Premium-rate%20telephone%20number">900 number</a> for readers to call to vote on whether <a href="Jason%20Todd">Jason Todd</a>, the second Robin, lived or died. Voters decided in favor of Jason's death by a narrow margin of 28 votes (see "").

The 1993 "" story arc introduced a new villain, <a href="Bane%20%28comics%29">Bane</a>, who critically injures Batman after pushing him to the limits of his endurance. Jean-Paul Valley, known as <a href="Azrael%20%28comics%29">Azrael</a>, is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence. Writers <a href="Doug%20Moench">Doug Moench</a>, <a href="Chuck%20Dixon">Chuck Dixon</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Grant%20%28writer%29">Alan Grant</a> worked on the Batman titles during "Knightfall", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s. 1998's "" storyline served as the precursor to 1999's "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28comics%29">No Man's Land</a>", a year-long storyline that ran through all the Batman-related titles dealing with the effects of an earthquake-ravaged Gotham City. At the conclusion of "No Man's Land", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by <a href="Bob%20Schreck">Bob Schreck</a>.

Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was <a href="Jeph%20Loeb">Jeph Loeb</a>. Along with longtime collaborator Tim Sale, they wrote two miniseries ("<a href="The%20Long%20Halloween">The Long Halloween</a>" and "") that pit an early in his career version of Batman against his entire <a href="List%20of%20Batman%20Family%20adversaries%23Classic%20Rogues%20Gallery">rogues gallery</a> (most notably <a href="Two-Face">Two-Face</a>, whose origin was re-envisioned by Loeb) while dealing with various mysteries involving <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a>s <a href="Holiday%20Killer">Holiday</a> and <a href="Hangman%20%28DC%20Comics%29">the Hangman</a>. In 2003, Loeb teamed with artist <a href="Jim%20Lee">Jim Lee</a> to work on another mystery arc: "" for the main Batman book. The twelve–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected <a href="Jason%20Todd">Jason Todd</a>, while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain <a href="Hush%20%28comics%29">Hush</a>. While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC. As the storyline was Jim Lee's first regular comic book work in nearly a decade, the series became #1 on the <a href="Diamond%20Comic%20Distributors">Diamond Comic Distributors</a> sales chart for the first time since "Batman" #500 (October 1993) and Jason Todd's appearance laid the groundwork for writer <a href="Judd%20Winick">Judd Winick</a>'s subsequent run as writer on "Batman", with another multi-issue epic, "", which ran from "Batman" #637–650 (April 2005–April 2006).

In 2005, DC launched "<a href="All-Star%20Batman%20and%20Robin">All-Star Batman and Robin</a>", a stand-alone comic series set outside the main DC Universe continuity. Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics, although it was widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence.

Starting in 2006, <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a> were the regular writers of "Batman" and "Detective Comics", with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore. Most notably of these elements were the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training. Morrison's run climaxed with "Batman R.I.P.", which brought Batman up against the villainous "Black Glove" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. "Batman R.I.P." segued into "<a href="Final%20Crisis">Final Crisis</a>" (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of <a href="Darkseid">Darkseid</a>. In the 2009 miniseries "", Wayne's former protégé Dick Grayson becomes the new Batman, and Wayne's son Damian becomes the new Robin. In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing "Batman", while Grant Morrison was given his own series, titled "<a href="Batman%20and%20Robin%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman and Robin</a>".

In 2010, the storyline "" saw Bruce travel through history, eventually returning to the present day. Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well. Bruce decided to take his war on crime globally, which is the central focus of "<a href="Batman%20Incorporated">Batman Incorporated</a>". DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in "Batman", "Detective Comics", and "Batman and Robin", while Wayne would be the main character in "Batman Incorporated". Also, Bruce appeared in another ongoing series, "".

In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its "Batman" franchise, were canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of <a href="the%20New%2052">the New 52</a> <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a>. Bruce Wayne is the only character to be identified as Batman and is featured in <a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">"Batman"</a>, "<a href="Detective%20Comics">Detective Comics</a>", "<a href="Batman%20and%20Robin%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman and Robin</a>", and "". Dick Grayson returns to the mantle of Nightwing and appears in his own ongoing series. While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. "Batman Incorporated" was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the "Leviathan" storyline.

With the beginning of the New 52, <a href="Scott%20Snyder">Scott Snyder</a> was the writer of the "Batman" title. His first major story arc was "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Owls">Night of the Owls</a>", where Batman confronts the <a href="Court%20of%20Owls">Court of Owls</a>, a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries. The second story arc was "<a href="Death%20of%20the%20Family">Death of the Family</a>", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family. The third story arc was "", which redefined Batman's origin in The New 52. It followed "Batman" #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years. The final storyline before the "<a href="Convergence%20%28comics%29">Convergence</a>" (2015) storyline was "", depicting the supposed final battle between Batman and the Joker when he unleashes the deadly Endgame virus onto Gotham City. The storyline ends with Batman and the Joker's supposed deaths.

Starting with "Batman" vol. 2, #41, Commissioner James Gordon takes over Bruce's mantle as a new, state-sanctioned, robotic-Batman, debuting in the <a href="Free%20Comic%20Book%20Day">Free Comic pageRank.Book Day</a> special comic "Divergence". However, Bruce Wayne is soon revealed to be alive, albeit now suffering almost total amnesia of his life as Batman and only remembering his life as Bruce Wayne through what he has learned from Alfred. Bruce Wayne finds happiness and proposes to his girlfriend, <a href="Julie%20Madison">Julie Madison</a>, but Mr. Bloom heavily injures Jim Gordon and takes control of Gotham City and threatens to destroy the city by energizing a particle reactor to create a "strange star" to swallow the city. Bruce Wayne discovers the truth that he was Batman and after talking to a stranger who smiles a lot (it is heavily implied that this is the amnesic Joker) he forces Alfred to implant his memories as Batman, but at the cost of his memories as the reborn Bruce Wayne. He returns and helps Jim Gordon defeat Mr. Bloom and shut down the reactor. Gordon gets his job back as the commissioner, and the government Batman project is shut down.

In 2015, DC Comics released "", the sequel to Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" and "The Dark Knight Strikes Again".

In June 2016, the <a href="DC%20Rebirth">DC Rebirth</a> event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles. "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" was rebooted with a one-shot issue and began shipping twice-monthly, starting with "Batman" vol. 3, #1 (June 2016). The series was written by <a href="Tom%20King%20%28comic%20book%20writer%29">Tom King</a>, and artwork was provided by <a href="David%20Finch%20%28comics%29">David Finch</a> and Mikel Janín. The "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" series introduced two vigilantes, Gotham and Gotham Girl. "Detective Comics" resumed its original numbering system starting with June 2016's #934, and the New 52 volume 2 of the series was added into volume 1. Writer <a href="James%20Tynion%20IV">James Tynion IV</a> and artists <a href="Eddy%20Barrows">Eddy Barrows</a> and Alvaro Martinez worked on "Detective Comics" #934, and the series initially featured a team consisting of <a href="Tim%20Drake">Tim Drake</a>, <a href="Stephanie%20Brown%20%28comics%29">Stephanie Brown</a>, <a href="Cassandra%20Cain">Cassandra Cain</a>, and <a href="Clayface">Clayface</a>, led by Batman and <a href="Batwoman">Batwoman</a>.

Batman's <a href="secret%20identity">secret identity</a> is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, <a href="Thomas%20Wayne">Dr. Thomas Wayne</a> and <a href="Martha%20Wayne">Martha Wayne</a>, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of <a href="Wayne%20Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, his inherited conglomerate. He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.

Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade (in counterpoint to the post-Crisis Superman, whose <a href="Clark%20Kent">Clark Kent</a> persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade). In "Batman Unmasked", a television documentary about the psychology of the character, <a href="behavioral%20science">behavioral scientist</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Karney">Benjamin Karney</a> notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better".

Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T. James Musler's book "Unleashing the Superhero in Us All" explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.

Will Brooker notes in his book "Batman Unmasked" that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience ... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ... and they're never wrong."

Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as ""wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and obsession"". The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams. Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "<a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julie Schwartz</a> did a Batman in "Batman" and "Detective" and <a href="Murray%20Boltinoff">Murray Boltinoff</a> did a Batman in the "Brave and the Bold" and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."

The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes". Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.

Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions". The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.

Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a <a href="Dionysus">dionysian</a> figure, a force for <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a> that imposes an individual order". Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting, a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty <a href="conscience">conscience</a>. Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization, such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior. Batman's original character was changed in the 1950s when the now-defunct <a href="Comics%20Code%20Authority">comic book codes</a> went into effect, and DC editor Whitney Ellsworth reinvented Batman as having a stringent moral code which never allowed him to kill. Miller's Batman was closer to the original, Golden Age version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary.

On two occasions former Robin <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> has served as Batman. He served briefly while Wayne recovered from spinal injuries caused by <a href="Bane%20%28comics%29">Bane</a> in the 1993 "Knightfall" storyline. He assumed the mantle again in a 2009 comic book while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010. As part of DC's <a href="The%20New%2052">2011 continuity relaunch</a>, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the "Flashpoint" crossover event.

In an interview with <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and <a href="Damian%20Wayne">Damian Wayne</a> as Robin represented a "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin". Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the <a href="Teen%20Titans">Teen Titans</a>, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; a lot looser and more relaxed."

Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence. <a href="Jean%20Paul%20Valley">Jean Paul Valley</a>, also known as <a href="Azrael">Azrael</a>, assumed the cowl after the events of the "" saga. <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James Gordon</a>, donned a mech-suit after the events of "", and served as Batman in 2015 and 2016.

Additionally, members of the group <a href="Batman%2C%20Incorporated">Batman, Incorporated</a>, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world. Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne.

Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic prowess". Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient <a href="scientist">scientist</a>, he is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver. Batman has been repeatedly described as having a genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical conditioning. As a <a href="polymath">polymath</a>, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by any other character in the DC Universe. He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in his endeavors as Batman. In the "" story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant minds on the planet.

Batman has trained extensively in various martial arts, mastering over 127 different types, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first storyline in "JLA."

Batman has the ability to function under great physical pain and to withstand <a href="telepathy">telepathy</a> and <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a>. He is a master of <a href="disguise">disguise</a>, multilingual, and an expert in <a href="espionage">espionage</a>, often gathering information under the identity of Matches Malone, a notorious gangster. He is a highly skilled in stealth movement and <a href="escapology">escapology</a>, which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable <a href="Deathtrap%20%28plot%20device%29">deathtraps</a> with little to no harm.

Batman is an expert in <a href="interrogation">interrogation</a> techniques and often uses extreme methods to extract information from suspects, such as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His <a href="intimidation">intimidating</a> and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of <a href="Superman">Superman</a> and <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a>.

Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the <a href="Batplane">Batplane</a>), as well as being able to operate other types of machinery. In some publications, he underwent some magician training.

Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian <a href="Les%20Daniels">Les Daniels</a> credits <a href="Gardner%20Fox">Gardner Fox</a> with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in "Detective Comics" #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the <a href="batarang">batarang</a> and the "Batgyro" in "Detective Comics" #31 and #32 (September; October 1939).


Batman's <a href="body%20armor">body armor</a>ed costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals. The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists' interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue. Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as dark blue and grey; as well as black and grey. In the <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>'s "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>" and "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>" films, Batman has been depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Trilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a>" depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. <a href="Ben%20Affleck">Ben Affleck</a>'s Batman in the <a href="DC%20Extended%20Universe">DC Extended Universe</a> films wears a suit more faithful to the comic books versions, in which the suit is grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.

Batman's <a href="batsuit">batsuit</a> aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> and <a href="Nomex">Nomex</a>. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops. The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same ... Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it."

Batman's primary vehicle is the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with <a href="Car%20tailfin">tailfins</a> that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the <a href="Batplane">Batplane</a> (later called the "Batwing"), along with various other means of transportation. In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">"Batman" live-action television show</a> and the "<a href="Super%20Friends">Super Friends</a>" animated series) stretched the practice to <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">campy</a> proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a <a href="Batboat">Batboat</a>, <a href="Bat-Sub">Bat-Sub</a>, and <a href="Batcycle">Batcycle</a>, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such "bat-" names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-<a href="shark%20repellent">shark repellent</a> bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>", Batman tells <a href="Carrie%20Kelley">Carrie Kelley</a> that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle. The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics <a href="The%20New%2052">relaunched</a> its entire line of comic books, with the batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.


Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his <a href="Batman%27s%20utility%20belt">utility belt</a>. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are <a href="gun">gun</a>s, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder.


When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.

In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s <a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">"Batman" TV series</a>, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>, specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.


The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic "" (issue #45) and the 2005 film "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>", the cave is said to have been part of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>.

Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.

Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime. These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's "<a href="List%20of%20Batman%20Family%20adversaries%23Classic%20rogues%20gallery">rogues gallery</a>". Batman's "most implacable foe" is the <a href="Joker%20%28character%29">Joker</a>, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker represents "everything Batman [opposes]". Other long time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery include <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> (a <a href="burglary">cat burglar</a> antiheroine who is an occasional ally and romantic interest), the <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">Penguin</a>, <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a>, <a href="Two-Face">Two-Face</a>, the <a href="Riddler">Riddler</a>, the <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Scarecrow</a>, <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href="Poison%20Ivy%20%28comics%29">Poison Ivy</a>, <a href="Harley%20Quinn">Harley Quinn</a>, <a href="Bane%20%28comics%29">Bane</a>, <a href="Clayface">Clayface</a>, and <a href="Killer%20Croc">Killer Croc</a> among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>.

Batman's butler, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, first appeared in "Batman" #16 (1943). He serves as Bruce Wayne's loyal father figure and is one of the few persons to know his secret identity. Alfred raised Bruce after his parents' death and knows him on a very personal level. He is sometimes portrayed as a sidekick to Batman and the only other resident of Wayne Manor aside from Bruce. The character "[lends] a homely touch to Batman's environs and [is] ever ready to provide a steadying and reassuring hand" to the hero and his sidekick.

The informal name "<a href="List%20of%20Batman%20supporting%20characters%23Batman%20Family">Batman family</a>" is used for a group of characters closely allied with Batman, generally masked vigilantes who either have been trained by Batman or operate in Gotham City with his tacit approval. They include: <a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Barbara Gordon</a>, Commissioner Gordon's daughter, who has fought crime under the vigilante identity of <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a> and, during a period in which she was confined to a wheelchair due to a gunshot wound inflicted by the Joker, the <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">computer hacker</a> Oracle; <a href="Huntress%20%28Helena%20Bertinelli%29">Helena Bertinelli</a>, the sole surviving member of a mob family turned vigilante, who has worked with Batman on occasion, primarily as <a href="Huntress%20%28comics%29">the Huntress</a> and as Batgirl for a brief stint; <a href="Cassandra%20Cain">Cassandra Cain</a>, the daughter of professional assassins <a href="David%20Cain%20%28comics%29">David Cain</a>, and <a href="Lady%20Shiva">Lady Shiva</a>, who succeeded Bertinelli as Batgirl.

<a href="Lucius%20Fox">Lucius Fox</a>, a technology specialist and Bruce Wayne's business manager who is well aware of his employer's clandestine vigilante activities; <a href="Leslie%20Thompkins">Dr. Leslie Thompkins</a>, a family friend who like Alfred became a surrogate parental figure to Bruce Wayne after the deaths of his parents, and is also aware of his secret identity; <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a>, an investigative journalist who often reports on Batman's activities for the Gotham Gazette; <a href="Ace%20the%20Bat-Hound">Ace the Bat-Hound</a>, Batman's canine partner who was predominantly active in the 1950s and 1960s; and <a href="Bat-Mite">Bat-Mite</a>, an extra-dimensional imp predominately active in the 1960s who idolizes Batman.

As Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, <a href="Chief%20of%20police">Commissioner</a> <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James "Jim" Gordon</a> debuted along with Batman in "Detective Comics" #27 and has been a consistent presence ever since. As a crime-fighting <a href="everyman">everyman</a>, he shares the Batman's goals while offering, much as the character of <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Watson</a> does in <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> stories, a normal person's perspective on the work of Batman's extraordinary genius.

Batman is at times a member of superhero teams such as the <a href="Justice%20League%20of%20America">Justice League of America</a> and the <a href="Outsiders%20%28comics%29">Outsiders</a>. Batman has often been paired in adventures with his Justice League teammate Superman, notably as the co-stars of "World's Finest" and "<a href="Superman/Batman">Superman/Batman</a>" series. In pre-Crisis continuity, the two are depicted as close friends; however, in current continuity, they are still close friends but an uneasy relationship, with an emphasis on their differing views on crime-fighting and justice. In "<a href="Superman/Batman">Superman/Batman</a>" #3 (December 2003), <a href="Superman">Superman</a> observes, "Sometimes, I admit, I think of Bruce as a man in a costume. Then, with some gadget from his utility belt, he reminds me that he has an extraordinarily inventive mind. And how lucky I am to be able to call on him."

Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years. Bill Finger stated that he wanted to include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him thinking." The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero <a href="Nightwing">Nightwing</a>. A second Robin, <a href="Jason%20Todd">Jason Todd</a>, appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but was later revived. He used the Joker's old persona, the <a href="Red%20Hood">Red Hood</a>, and became an <a href="antihero">antihero</a> vigilante with no qualms about using <a href="firearms">firearms</a> or <a href="deadly%20force">deadly force</a>. <a href="Carrie%20Kelly">Carrie Kelly</a>, the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Returns">The Dark Knight Returns</a>" and "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Strikes%20Again">The Dark Knight Strikes Again</a>", fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.

The third Robin in mainstream comics is <a href="Tim%20Drake">Tim Drake</a>, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series, and currently goes by <a href="Red%20Robin%20%28comics%29">Red Robin</a>, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new millennium, <a href="Stephanie%20Brown%20%28comics%29">Stephanie Brown</a> served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity The Spoiler, and later as <a href="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>. After Stephanie Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The role eventually passed to <a href="Damian%20Wayne">Damian Wayne</a>, the ten-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>, in the late 2000s. Damian's tenure as "du jour" Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of "<a href="Batman%20Incorporated">Batman Incorporated</a>" in 2013. Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed the <a href="ornithology">ornithological</a> theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of <a href="Bluebird%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Bluebird</a> in 2014. Unlike the Robins, Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit <a href="non-lethal%20weapon">non-lethal</a>; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that fires taser rounds. In 2015, a new series titled "<a href="We%20Are%20Robin%20%28comic%20book%29">We Are Robin</a>" will focus on a group of teenagers using the Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City.

<a href="Huntress%20%28Helena%20Wayne%29">Helena Wayne</a> is the biological daughter of <a href="Batman%20%28Earth-Two%29">Bruce Wayne</a> and <a href="Catwoman%23Golden%20and%20Silver%20Age%20versions">Selina Kyle</a> of an <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">alternate universe</a> established in the early 1960s (<a href="Multiverse%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Multiverse</a>) where the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Comic%20Books">Golden Age</a> stories took place.

<a href="Damian%20Wayne">Damian Wayne</a> is the biological son of Bruce Wayne and <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>, and thus the grandson of <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a>.

<a href="Terry%20McGinnis">Terry McGinnis</a> is the biological son of Bruce Wayne in the <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">DC animated universe</a>, and has taken over the roll as Batman when Bruce has become too elderly to do it.

Writers have varied in the approach over the years to the "playboy" aspect of Bruce Wayne's persona. Some writers show his playboy reputation as a manufactured illusion to support his mission as Batman, while others have depicted Bruce Wayne as genuinely enjoying the benefits of being "Gotham's most eligible bachelor". Bruce Wayne has been portrayed as being romantically linked with many women throughout his various incarnations. The most significant relationships occurred with Selina Kyle, who is also <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> and <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>, as both women gave birth to his biological offsprings, Helena Wayne and Damian Wayne, respectively.

Batman's first romantic interest was <a href="Julie%20Madison">Julie Madison</a> in "<a href="Detective%20Comics">Detective Comics</a>" #31 (Sept. <a href="1939%20in%20comics">1939</a>), however their romance was short-lived. Some of Batman's romantic interests have been women with a respected status in society, such as <a href="Julie%20Madison">Julie Madison</a>, <a href="Vicki%20Vale">Vicki Vale</a>, and <a href="Silver%20St.%20Cloud">Silver St. Cloud</a>. Batman has also been romantically involved with allies, such as <a href="Batwoman%23Kathy%20Kane">Kathy Kane (Batwoman)</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Barbara Gordon (Batgirl)</a>, <a href="Sasha%20Bordeaux">Sasha Bordeaux</a>, and <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, and with villains, such as <a href="Catwoman">Selina Kyle (Catwoman)</a>, Jezebel Jet, <a href="Poison%20Ivy%20%28comics%29">Pamela Isley (Poison Ivy)</a>, and <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>.

While most of Batman's romantic relationships tend to be short in duration, <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> has been his most enduring romance throughout the years. The attraction between Batman and Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, is present in nearly every version and medium in which the characters appear. Although Catwoman is typically portrayed as a villain, Batman and Catwoman have worked together in achieving common goals and are usually depicted as having a romantic connection.

In an early 1980s storyline, Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne develop a relationship, in which the closing panel of the final story shows her referring to Batman as "Bruce". However, a change in the editorial team brought a swift end to that storyline and, apparently, all that transpired during the story arc. Out of costume, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship during "". The story shows Selina saving Bruce from Poison Ivy. However, the relationship ends when Bruce rejects her advances twice; once as Bruce and once as Batman. In "", he stands her up on two holidays, causing her to leave him for good and to leave Gotham City for a while. When the two meet at an opera many years later, during the events of the twelve-issue story arc called "", Bruce comments that the two no longer have a relationship as Bruce and Selina. However, "Hush" sees Batman and Catwoman allied against the entire <a href="List%20of%20Batman%20Family%20adversaries%23Classic%20Rogues%20Gallery">rogues gallery</a> and rekindling their romantic relationship. In "'Hush", Batman reveals his true identity to Catwoman.

The <a href="Batman%20%28Earth-Two%29">Earth-Two Batman</a>, a character from a parallel world, partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Selina Kyle, as shown in "<a href="Superman%20Family">Superman Family</a>" #211. They have a daughter named <a href="Huntress%20%28Helena%20Wayne%29">Helena Wayne</a>, who becomes the Huntress. Along with Dick Grayson, the <a href="Robin%20%28Earth-Two%29">Earth-Two Robin</a>, the Huntress takes the role as Gotham's protector once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.

Batman and Catwoman are shown having a sexual encounter on a rooftop in "Catwoman" vol. 4, #1 (2011); the same issue implies that the two have an ongoing sexual relationship. Following the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot, the two once again have a sexual encounter on top of a building in "Batman" vol. 3, #14 (2017).

Batman's history has undergone various <a href="retroactive%20continuity">retroactive continuity</a> revisions, both minor and major. Few elements of the character's history have remained constant. Scholars <a href="William%20Uricchio">William Uricchio</a> and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."

The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's <a href="origin%20story">origin story</a>. As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. <a href="Thomas%20Wayne">Thomas Wayne</a> and his wife <a href="Martha%20Wayne">Martha</a>, murdered with a gun by a mugger named <a href="Joe%20Chill">Joe Chill</a>. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> as Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number", a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.

In Batman's first appearance in "Detective Comics" #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter. Batman's origin is first presented in "Detective Comics" #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in "Batman" #47. As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a> socialites. Bruce is brought up in <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a>, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named <a href="Joe%20Chill">Joe Chill</a> while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ..." As if responding to his desires, a <a href="bat">bat</a> suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.

In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a fiancée named <a href="Julie%20Madison">Julie Madison</a>. In "Detective Comics" #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Dick Grayson</a>, who becomes his vigilante partner, <a href="Robin%20%28comics%29">Robin</a>. Batman also becomes a founding member of the <a href="Justice%20Society%20of%20America">Justice Society of America</a>, although he, like Superman, is an honorary member, and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of <a href="Gotham%20City%20Police%20Department">Gotham City's police department</a>. During this time, <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler.

The <a href="Silver%20Age%20of%20Comic%20Books">Silver Age of Comic Books</a> in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced <a href="Flash%20%28Barry%20Allen%29">Barry Allen</a> as a new, updated version of <a href="Flash%20%28comics%29">The Flash</a>. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as <a href="Earth-One">Earth-One</a>. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until "Detective Comics" #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.

After the introduction of DC Comics' <a href="Multiverse%20%28DC%20Comics%29">multiverse</a> in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the <a href="Batman%20%28Earth-Two%29">Earth-Two Batman</a>, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle. The two have a daughter, <a href="Huntress%20%28Helena%20Wayne%29">Helena Wayne</a>, who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the <a href="Robin%20%28Earth-Two%29">Earth-Two Robin</a>, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or <a href="Green%20Lantern">Green Lantern</a>, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age. Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in "Batman" #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively. In 1980 then-editor <a href="Paul%20Levitz">Paul Levitz</a> commissioned the "Untold Legend of the Batman" <a href="limited%20series">limited series</a> to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.

Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in "<a href="World%27s%20Finest%20Comics">World's Finest Comics</a>", starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the <a href="Justice%20League">Justice League of America</a>, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's "<a href="Brave%20and%20the%20Bold">Brave and the Bold</a>" #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, "Brave and the Bold" became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different <a href="DC%20Universe">DC Universe</a> superhero each month.

In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, <a href="Wayne%20Manor">Wayne Manor</a> into a <a href="penthouse%20apartment">penthouse apartment</a> atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal <a href="psychopathy">psychopath</a>, and the arrival of <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a>, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes <a href="Nightwing">Nightwing</a>.

In the final issue of "Brave and the Bold" in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the <a href="Outsiders%20%28comics%29">Outsiders</a>. He serves as the team's leader until "Batman and the Outsiders" #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed its title.

After the 12-issue <a href="limited%20series">limited series</a> "Crisis on Infinite Earths", DC Comics <a href="Retroactive%20continuity">retconned</a> the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "" from "Batman" #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character. Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following "Crisis", DC launched a new Batman title called "<a href="Legends%20of%20the%20Dark%20Knight">Legends of the Dark Knight</a>" in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the "Year One" period.

Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crime-fighting, a result of the pain of losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when <a href="Tim%20Drake">Tim Drake</a> becomes the new Robin.

Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been inter-title crossovers that run for a number of issues. In 1993, DC published "". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading Wayne to ask <a href="Azrael%20%28comics%29">Azrael</a> to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.

The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline "<a href="Zero%20Hour%20%28comics%29">Zero Hour</a>" changes aspects of DC continuity again, including those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.

Batman once again becomes a member of the <a href="Justice%20League">Justice League</a> during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled "JLA". During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "" storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28comics%29">No Man's Land</a>".

Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon and <a href="Harvey%20Bullock%20%28comics%29">Harvey Bullock</a> are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the <a href="sadistic%20personality%20disorder">sadistic</a> <a href="Black%20Mask%20%28comics%29">Black Mask</a> the undisputed ruler of the city's criminal gangs. <a href="Lex%20Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "" story arcs. Though Batman is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with help from <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a> in "<a href="Superman/Batman">Superman/Batman</a>" #1–6.

DC Comics' 2005 <a href="limited%20series">limited series</a> "<a href="Identity%20Crisis%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Identity Crisis</a>" reveals that JLA member <a href="Zatanna">Zatanna</a> had altered Batman's memories to prevent him from stopping the Justice League from <a href="lobotomy">lobotomizing</a> <a href="Doctor%20Light%20%28Arthur%20Light%29">Dr. Light</a> after he raped <a href="Sue%20Dibny">Sue Dibny</a>. Batman later creates the <a href="OMACs">Brother I</a> satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the "<a href="Infinite%20Crisis">Infinite Crisis</a>" miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes destroy Brother Eye and the OMACs, though at the very end Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.

Following "Infinite Crisis", Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to "rebuild Batman". In the "" storyline, Batman and Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the "52" series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons. Later on in "52", Batman is shown undergoing an intense meditation ritual in <a href="Nanda%20Parbat">Nanda Parbat</a>. This becomes an important part of the regular "Batman" title, which reveals that Batman is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having "hunted down and ate" the last traces of fear in his mind. At the end of the "Face the Face" story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim (who had lost both of his parents at various points in the character's history) as his son. The follow-up story arc in "Batman", "<a href="Batman%20and%20Son">Batman and Son</a>", introduces <a href="Damian%20Wayne">Damian Wayne</a>, who is Batman's son with <a href="Talia%20al%20Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>. Although originally in <a href="Son%20of%20the%20Demon">Son of the Demon</a>, Bruce's coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual, this arc ret-conned it into Talia forcing herself on Bruce.

Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new "Justice League of America" series, and is leading the newest incarnation of the <a href="Outsiders%20%28comics%29">Outsiders</a>.

<a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s 2008 storyline, "<a href="Batman%20R.I.P.">Batman R.I.P.</a>" featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic villain <a href="Simon%20Hurt">Doctor Hurt</a> and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would speculated to feature the death of Bruce Wayne. However, though Batman is shown to possibly perish at the end of the arc, the two-issue arc "Last Rites", which leads into the crossover storylines "<a href="Final%20Crisis">Final Crisis</a>", shows that Batman survives his helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave, only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by the JLA to help investigate the <a href="New%20Gods">New God</a> <a href="Orion%20%28comics%29">Orion</a>'s death. The story ends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used to kill Orion, setting up its use in "Final Crisis". In the pages of "Final Crisis" Batman is reduced to a charred skeleton. In "Final Crisis" #7 Wayne is shown witnessing the passing of the first man, <a href="Anthro%20%28comics%29">Anthro</a>. Wayne's "death" sets up the three-issue "" miniseries in which Wayne's ex-proteges compete for the "right" to assume the role of Batman, which concludes with Grayson becoming Batman, while Tim Drake takes on the identity of <a href="Red%20Robin%20%28comics%29">Red Robin</a>. Dick and Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline "<a href="Blackest%20Night">Blackest Night</a>", what appears to be Bruce's corpse is reanimated as a <a href="Black%20Lantern%20Corps">Black Lantern</a> <a href="zombie">zombie</a>, but is later shown that Bruce's corpse is one of Darkseid's failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive.

Bruce subsequently returns in Morrison's miniseries "", which depicts his travels through time from <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a> to present-day Gotham. Bruce's return sets up "<a href="Batman%20Incorporated">Batman Incorporated</a>", an ongoing series which focuses on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe, allowing Dick and Damian to continue as Gotham's Dynamic Duo. Bruce publicly announces that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as "Batman, Incorporated". However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic books, <a href="the%20New%2052">the New 52</a>, Dick Grayson is restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch also interrupts the publication of "Batman, Incorporated", which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the new status quo.

Batman has become a pop culture icon, recognized around the world. The character's presence has extended beyond his comic book origins; events such as the release of the 1989 "Batman" film and its accompanying merchandising "brought the Batman to the forefront of public consciousness". In an article commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the character, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote, "Batman is a figure blurred by the endless reinvention that is modern mass culture. He is at once an icon and a commodity: the perfect cultural artefact for the 21st century."

The character of Batman has appeared in various media aside from comic books, such as newspaper syndicated <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a>s, books, radio dramas, television, a <a href="Batman%20Live">stage show</a>, and several theatrical <a href="Batman%20in%20film">feature films</a>. The first adaptation of Batman was as a daily newspaper comic strip which premiered on October 25, 1943. That same year the character was adapted in the 15-part <a href="Serial%20film">serial</a> "<a href="Batman%20%28serial%29">Batman</a>", with <a href="Lewis%20Wilson">Lewis Wilson</a> becoming the first actor to portray Batman on screen. While Batman never had a radio series of his own, the character made occasional guest appearances in "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Superman%20%28radio%29">The Adventures of Superman</a>" starting in 1945 on occasions when Superman voice actor <a href="Bud%20Collyer">Bud Collyer</a> needed time off. A second movie serial, "<a href="Batman%20and%20Robin%20%28serial%29">Batman and Robin</a>", followed in 1949, with <a href="Robert%20Lowery%20%28actor%29">Robert Lowery</a> taking over the role of Batman. The exposure provided by these adaptations during the 1940s "helped make [Batman] a household name for millions who never bought a comic book".

In the 1964 publication of <a href="Donald%20Barthelme">Donald Barthelme</a>'s collection of short stories "Come Back, Dr. Caligari", Barthelme wrote "The Joker's Greatest Triumph". Batman is portrayed for purposes of spoof as a pretentious French-speaking rich man.

The "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>" television series, starring <a href="Adam%20West">Adam West</a>, premiered in January 1966 on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> television network. Inflected with a <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp</a> sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, "Back to the Batcave", West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a <a href="farce">farce</a> or <a href="Parody">lampoon</a>, and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes; ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the "Batman" television series, the cast and crew made the theatrical film "<a href="Batman%20%281966%20film%29">Batman</a>" (1966). <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a> recorded the theme song from the "Batman" show for their 1966 EP <a href="Ready%20Steady%20Who">Ready Steady Who</a>, and <a href="The%20Kinks">The Kinks</a> performed the theme song on their 1967 album <a href="Live%20at%20Kelvin%20Hall">Live at Kelvin Hall</a>.

The popularity of the "Batman" TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in "<a href="The%20Batman/Superman%20Hour">The Batman/Superman Hour</a>"; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Batman">The Adventures of Batman</a>" and "Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder" which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's "<a href="Super%20Friends">Super Friends</a>" series; which was animated by <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>. <a href="Olan%20Soule">Olan Soule</a> was the voice of Batman in all these shows, but was eventually replaced during "Super Friends" by Adam West, who also voiced the character in <a href="Filmation">Filmation</a>'s 1977 series "<a href="The%20New%20Adventures%20of%20Batman">The New Adventures of Batman</a>".
In 1992, "" premiered on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> television network; produced by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a> and featuring <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a> as the voice of Batman. The series received considerable acclaim for its darker tone, mature writing, stylistic design, and thematic complexity compared to previous superhero cartoons, in addition to multiple <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s. The series' success led to the theatrical film "" (1993), as well as various <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">spin-off</a> TV series; including "", "<a href="The%20New%20Batman%20Adventures">The New Batman Adventures</a>", "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28TV%20series%29">Justice League</a>" and "<a href="Justice%20League%20Unlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a>" (each of which also featured Conroy as Batman's voice). The futuristic series "<a href="Batman%20Beyond">Batman Beyond</a>" also took place in this same animated continuity and featured a newer, younger <a href="Batman%20%28Terry%20McGinnis%29">Batman</a> voiced by <a href="Will%20Friedle">Will Friedle</a>, with the elderly Bruce Wayne (again voiced by Conroy) as a mentor.

In 2004, an unrelated animated series titled "<a href="The%20Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">The Batman</a>" made its debut with <a href="Rino%20Romano">Rino Romano</a> voicing Batman. In 2008, this show was replaced by another animated series, "", featuring <a href="Diedrich%20Bader">Diedrich Bader</a>'s voice as Batman. In 2013, a new <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a>-animated series titled "<a href="Beware%20the%20Batman">Beware the Batman</a>" made its debut, with <a href="Anthony%20Ruivivar">Anthony Ruivivar</a> voicing Batman.

In 2014, the live-action TV series "<a href="Gotham%20%28TV%20series%29">Gotham</a>" premiered on the Fox network, featuring <a href="David%20Mazouz">David Mazouz</a> as a 12-year-old Bruce Wayne.

To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the character, Warner Bros aired the television <a href="short%20film">short film</a>, "", that was also posted on DC's YouTube channel.

In 1989, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> released the live-action feature film "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>"; directed by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> and starring <a href="Michael%20Keaton">Michael Keaton</a> as the title character. The film was a huge success; not only was it the top-grossing film of the year, but at the time was the fifth highest-grossing film in history. The film also won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Art%20Direction">Academy Award for Best Art Direction</a>. The film's success spawned three sequels: "<a href="Batman%20Returns">Batman Returns</a>" (1992), "<a href="Batman%20Forever">Batman Forever</a>" (1995) and "<a href="Batman%20%26amp%3B%20Robin%20%28film%29">Batman & Robin</a>" (1997); the latter two of which were directed by <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a> instead of Burton, and replaced Keaton as Batman with <a href="Val%20Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> and <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, respectively. The second Schumacher film failed to outgross any of its predecessors and was critically panned; causing Warner Bros. to cancel the planned fourth sequel, "<a href="Batman%20in%20film%23Batman%20Unchained">Batman Unchained</a>", and end the initial <a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%20series%29">film series</a>.

In 2005, "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" was released by Warner Bros. as a <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> of the film series; directed by <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> and starring <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> as Batman. Its sequel, "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" (2008), set the record for the highest grossing opening weekend of all time in the U.S., earning approximately $158 million, and became the fastest film to reach the $400 million mark in the history of American cinema (eighteenth day of release). These record-breaking attendances saw "The Dark Knight" end its run as the second-highest domestic grossing film (at the time) with $533 million, bested then only by "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>". The film also won two Academy Awards, including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> for the late <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>. It was eventually followed by "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Rises">The Dark Knight Rises</a>" (2012), which served as a conclusion to Nolan's <a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20Trilogy">film series</a>.
Since 2008, Batman has also starred in various direct-to-video animated films under the <a href="DC%20Universe%20Animated%20Original%20Movies">DC Universe Animated Original Movies</a> banner. Kevin Conroy has reprised his voice role of Batman for several of these films, while others have featured celebrity voice actors in the role; including <a href="Jeremy%20Sisto">Jeremy Sisto</a>, <a href="William%20Baldwin">William Baldwin</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Greenwood">Bruce Greenwood</a>, <a href="Ben%20McKenzie">Ben McKenzie</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Weller">Peter Weller</a>. A <a href="Lego">Lego</a>-themed version of Batman was also featured as one of the protagonists in the animated film "<a href="The%20Lego%20Movie">The Lego Movie</a>" (2014), with <a href="Will%20Arnett">Will Arnett</a> providing the voice. Arnett reprised the voice role for the spin-off film "<a href="The%20Lego%20Batman%20Movie">The Lego Batman Movie</a>" (2017).

In 2016, <a href="Ben%20Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> began portraying Batman in the <a href="DC%20Extended%20Universe">DC Extended Universe</a> with the release of the film "", directed by <a href="Zack%20Snyder">Zack Snyder</a>. Affleck also made a cameo appearance as Batman in <a href="David%20Ayer">David Ayer</a>'s film "<a href="Suicide%20Squad%20%28film%29">Suicide Squad</a>" (2016). Affleck will reprise the role again in the upcoming 2017 film "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28film%29">Justice League</a>" and will star in an upcoming Batman film, also set in the DC Extended Universe.

Since 1986, Batman has starred in multiple video games, most of which were adaptations of the various cinematic or animated incarnations of the character. Among the most successful of these games is the "" series. The first installment, "" (2009), was released by <a href="Rocksteady%20Studios">Rocksteady Studios</a> to critical acclaim; review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports it as having received 92% positive reviews. It was followed by the sequel "" (2011), which also received widespread acclaim and holds a Metacritic ranking of 94%. A prequel game titled "" (2013) was later released by <a href="WB%20Games%20Montr%C3%A9al">WB Games Montréal</a>. A fourth game titled "" (2015) has also been released by Rocksteady. As with most animated "Batman" productions, <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a> has provided the voice of the character for these games; excluding "Arkham Origins", in which the younger Batman is voiced by <a href="Roger%20Craig%20Smith">Roger Craig Smith</a>. In 2016, Telltale Games released "" adventure game, which changed the Wayne Family's history as it is depicted in the Batman mythos.

Gay interpretations of the character have been part of the academic study of Batman since psychologist <a href="Fredric%20Wertham">Fredric Wertham</a> asserted in "<a href="Seduction%20of%20the%20Innocent">Seduction of the Innocent</a>" in 1954 that "Batman stories are psychologically homosexual ... The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious." Andy Medhurst wrote in his 1991 essay "Batman, Deviance, and Camp" that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because "he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality". Professor of film and cultural studies <a href="Will%20Brooker">Will Brooker</a> argues the validity of a queer reading of Batman, and that gay readers would naturally find themselves drawn to the lifestyle depicted within, whether the character of Bruce Wayne himself were explicitly gay or not. He also identifies a homophobic element to the vigor with which mainstream fandom rejects the possibility of a gay reading of the character.

Creators associated with the character have expressed their own opinions. Writer Alan Grant has stated, "The Batman I wrote for 13 years isn't gay ... everybody's Batman all the way back to Bob Kane ... none of them wrote him as a gay character. Only Joel Schumacher might have had an opposing view." Frank Miller views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crimefighting, concluding, "He'd be "much" healthier if he were gay." <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a> said that "Gayness is built into Batman ... Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it. All these women fancy him and they all wear fetish clothes and jump around rooftops to get to him. He doesn't care—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid."

In 2000, DC refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from "Batman" #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper "All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s". In 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of <a href="watercolor">watercolor</a>s depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses, prompting DC to threaten legal action.

Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche.

In "Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight", Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a> is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the "shadow archetype". This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself. Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil. Langley uses the Jungian perspective to assert that Batman appeals to our own need to face our "shadow selves".

Boston Red Sox

The Boston Red Sox are an American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> team based in <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. The Red Sox compete in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) as a member club of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="American%20League%20East">East</a> division. The Red Sox have won eight <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> <a href="List%20of%20World%20Series%20champions">championships</a> and have played in twelve. Founded in as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home <a href="baseball%20park">ballpark</a> has been <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> since . The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, <a href="John%20I.%20Taylor">John I. Taylor</a>, around , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the "<a href="Boston%20Red%20Stockings%20%28disambiguation%29">Boston Red Stockings</a>", including the forerunner of the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>.

Boston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in the first <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> in <a href="1903%20World%20Series">1903</a> and winning four more championships by . However, they then went into one of the longest championship <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20franchise%20postseason%20droughts">droughts</a> in baseball history, dubbed the "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>" after its alleged beginning with the Red Sox' sale of <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> to the rival <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in . The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including <a href="Enos%20Slaughter">Enos Slaughter</a>'s "<a href="Slaughter%27s%20Mad%20Dash">mad dash</a>" in , the "<a href="The%20Impossible%20Dream%20%281967%29">Impossible Dream</a>" of , <a href="Carlton%20Fisk">Carlton Fisk</a>'s home run in , and <a href="Bill%20Buckner">Bill Buckner</a>'s error in . Following their victory in the <a href="2013%20World%20Series">2013 World Series</a>, they became the first team to win three <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> trophies in the 21st century, including championships in 2004 and . Red Sox history has also been marked by the team's <a href="Yankees%E2%80%93Red%20Sox%20rivalry">intense rivalry</a> with the Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in <a href="List%20of%20sports%20rivalries">North American professional sports</a>.

The Boston Red Sox are owned by <a href="Fenway%20Sports%20Group">Fenway Sports Group</a>, which also owns <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in England. The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance. From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record. <a href="Neil%20Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>'s "<a href="Sweet%20Caroline">Sweet Caroline</a>" has become an anthem for the Red Sox.
The name "Red Sox", chosen by owner <a href="John%20I.%20Taylor">John I. Taylor</a> after the 1907 season, refers to the red hose in the team uniform beginning . "Sox" had been previously adopted for the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of "Stockings", as "Stockings Win!" in <a href="Large%20font">large type</a> would not fit on a page. The team name "Red Sox" had previously been used as early as 1888 by a 'colored' team from Norfolk, Virginia. The <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a> media sometimes refers to the team as "Medias Rojas", a translation of "red socks". The official Spanish site uses the variant "Los Red Sox".

The Red Stockings nickname was first used by a baseball team by the <a href="Cincinnati%20Red%20Stockings%20%28AA%29">Cincinnati Red Stockings</a>, who were members of the pioneering <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Base Ball Players</a>. Managed by <a href="Harry%20Wright">Harry Wright</a>, Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman <a href="Ivers%20Whitney%20Adams">Ivers Whitney Adams</a> to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the "Red Stockings" nickname along (Most nicknames were then only nicknames, neither club names nor registered trademarks, so the migration was informal). The <a href="History%20of%20the%20Boston%20Braves">Boston Red Stockings</a> won four championships in the five seasons of the new <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Baseball%20Players">National Association</a>, the first professional league.

When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> in 1876, the "Red Stockings" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the "Red Caps". Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname "Braves" in ; the club <a href="Boston%20Braves%20To%20Milwaukee">eventually left Boston for Milwaukee</a> and is now playing in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta, Georgia</a>.

In , the upstart <a href="American%20League">American League</a> established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore "dark blue" stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply "Boston", "Bostonians" or "the Bostons"; or the "Americans" or "Boston Americans" as in "American Leaguers", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read "Boston", except for 1902 when they sported large letters "B" and "A" denoting "Boston" and "American." Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including "Somersets" (for owner <a href="Charles%20Somers">Charles Somers</a>), "Plymouth Rocks", "Beaneaters", the "Collinsites" (for manager <a href="Jimmy%20Collins">Jimmy Collins</a>)", and "Pilgrims."

For years many sources have listed "Pilgrims" as the early Boston AL team's "official" nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years. The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled "The Pilgrims At Home" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener ("Rory O'More" melody). This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. <a href="John%20I.%20Taylor">John I. Taylor</a> had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims "sounded too much like homeless wanderers."

The National League club in Boston, though seldom called the "Red Stockings" anymore, still wore red trim. In , the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and would remain the "Red Sox" for good.

The name is often <a href="List%20of%20baseball%20nicknames">shortened</a> to "Bosox" or "BoSox", a combination of "Boston" and "Sox" (similar to the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">"ChiSox"</a> in Chicago or the minor league <a href="Pawtucket%20Red%20Sox">"PawSox"</a> of Pawtucket). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the "Crimson Hose" and "the Olde Towne Team". Recently, media have begun to call them the "Sawx" casually, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a <a href="New%20England%20English">New England accent</a>. However, most fans simply refer to the team as the "Sox" when the context is understood to mean Red Sox.

The formal name of the entity which owns the team is "Boston Red Sox Baseball Club Limited Partnership". The name shown on the door on Yawkey Way, "Boston American League Baseball Company", is historical, predating the formation of the limited partnership on May 26, 1978. The entrance also figures in <a href="Robert%20B.%20Parker">Robert B. Parker</a>'s Spenser-and-baseball novel <a href="Mortal%20Stakes">Mortal Stakes</a>.

In , the minor Western League, led by <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a>, declared its equality with the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>, then the only major league in baseball. Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname "Americans". This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which would not adopt an official nickname until .
The upstart league placed franchises in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> and <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>. After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he would need a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, <a href="George%20Brumder">George Brumder</a> who sold the team one year later. Playing their home games at <a href="Huntington%20Avenue%20Grounds">Huntington Avenue Grounds</a>, the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star <a href="third%20baseman">third baseman</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Collins">Jimmy Collins</a>, outfielders <a href="Chick%20Stahl">Chick Stahl</a>, <a href="Buck%20Freeman">Buck Freeman</a>, and <a href="Patsy%20Dougherty">Patsy Dougherty</a>, and <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> <a href="Cy%20Young">Cy Young</a>, who in 1901 won the pitching <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Triple%20Crown">Triple Crown</a> with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 games), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts. His 1901 to seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.

In <a href="1903%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1903</a>, <a href="1903%20Boston%20Americans%20season">Boston</a> participated in the <a href="1903%20World%20Series">first modern World Series</a>, going up against the <a href="1903%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6½ games. Aided by the modified chants of "<a href="Tessie">Tessie</a>" by the <a href="Royal%20Rooters">Royal Rooters</a> <a href="fan%20club">fan club</a> and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.
The <a href="1904%20Boston%20Americans%20season">1904 club</a> was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the <a href="1904%20New%20York%20Highlanders%20season">New York Highlanders</a>, the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what would become a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for <a href="Bob%20Unglaub">Bob Unglaub</a>. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, <a href="Hilltop%20Park">Hilltop Park</a>. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With <a href="Jack%20Chesbro">Jack Chesbro</a>, the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and <a href="Lou%20Criger">Lou Criger</a> scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.
Unfortunately, the NL champion <a href="1904%20New%20York%20Giants%20season">New York Giants</a> declined to play any <a href="1904%20World%20Series">postseason series</a>, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in . These successful times soon ended, however, as <a href="1906%20Boston%20Americans%20season">Boston</a> lost 100 games in . However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.
By , legendary <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a> <a href="Tris%20Speaker">Tris Speaker</a> had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox would not win the pennant again until their 105-win <a href="1912%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a>, finishing with a club record .691 <a href="winning%20percentage">winning percentage</a>. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game—Tris Speaker, <a href="Harry%20Hooper">Harry Hooper</a> and <a href="Duffy%20Lewis">Duffy Lewis</a>—and superstar pitcher <a href="Smoky%20Joe%20Wood">Smoky Joe Wood</a>, the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4–3–1 in the classic <a href="1912%20World%20Series">1912 World Series</a> best known for <a href="Snodgrass%27s%20Muff">Snodgrass's Muff</a>. From to the Red Sox were owned by <a href="Joseph%20Lannin">Joseph Lannin</a>, who signed <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in propelled the <a href="1915%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> to the <a href="1915%20World%20Series">1915 World Series</a>, where they beat the <a href="1915%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a> four games to one. Following the season, Tris Speaker was traded to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The <a href="1916%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> went on to win the <a href="1916%20World%20Series">1916 World Series</a>, this time defeating the <a href="Brooklyn%20Robins">Brooklyn Robins</a>. In , Babe Ruth led his team to another <a href="1918%20World%20Series">World Series</a> championship, this time over the <a href="1918%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a>.

<a href="Harry%20Frazee">Harry Frazee</a> bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder <a href="Duffy%20Lewis">Duffy Lewis</a>, pitcher <a href="Dutch%20Leonard%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Dutch Leonard</a> (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914), and pitcher <a href="Ernie%20Shore">Ernie Shore</a> were traded to the Yankees for pitcher <a href="Ray%20Caldwell">Ray Caldwell</a>, <a href="Slim%20Love">Slim Love</a>, <a href="Roxy%20Walters">Roxy Walters</a>, <a href="Frank%20Gilhooley">Frank Gilhooley</a> and $15,000. As all three players were well regarded in Boston—Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average—this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000. Mays would go on to have several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.

On December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in .) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> play "<a href="No%2C%20No%2C%20Nanette">No, No, Nanette</a>". That play did not actually open on Broadway until , but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, "The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth", "No, No, Nanette" had originated as a non-musical stage play called "My Lady Friends", which opened on Broadway in December 1919. "My Lady Friends" had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.

During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> had a détente; they were called "Insurrectos" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in ). Further, providing the Yankees with a <a href="box%20office">box office</a> attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and "the Loyal Five" clubs. Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.

New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the <a href="Yankees%E2%80%93Red%20Sox%20rivalry">Yankees–Red Sox rivalry</a>, considered the "Greatest Rivalry on Earth" by American sports journalists.
After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, <a href="Wally%20Schang">Wally Schang</a>, <a href="Waite%20Hoyt">Waite Hoyt</a>, <a href="Harry%20Harper">Harry Harper</a> and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for <a href="Del%20Pratt">Del Pratt</a>, <a href="Muddy%20Ruel">Muddy Ruel</a>, John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash. The <a href="1921%20in%20baseball">following winter</a>, iron man <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Everett%20Scott">Everett Scott</a>, and pitchers <a href="Bullet%20Joe%20Bush">Bullet Joe Bush</a> and <a href="Sad%20Sam%20Jones">Sad Sam Jones</a> were traded to the Yankees for <a href="Roger%20Peckinpaugh">Roger Peckinpaugh</a> (who would be immediately shipped to the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>), <a href="Jack%20Quinn%20%28baseball%29">Jack Quinn</a>, <a href="Rip%20Collins%20%28pitcher%29">Rip Collins</a>, Bill Piercy and $50,000. On July 23, , <a href="Joe%20Dugan">Joe Dugan</a> and <a href="Elmer%20Smith%20%28baseball%20outfielder%2C%20born%201892%29">Elmer Smith</a> were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, <a href="Johnny%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Johnny Mitchell</a>, and <a href="Lefty%20O%27Doul">Lefty O'Doul</a>, who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the <a href="1922%20St.%20Louis%20Browns%20season">St. Louis Browns</a> in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year. Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of <a href="Herb%20Pennock">Herb Pennock</a>, occurring in early . Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, <a href="George%20Murray%20%28baseball%29">George Murray</a> and $50,000.

The loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades. During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to <a href="Bob%20Quinn%20%28baseball%29">Bob Quinn</a> in 1923. During an eight-year period from to , the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43-111, still the worst record in franchise history. One of the few bright spots on these teams was <a href="Earl%20Webb">Earl Webb</a>, who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in with 67. The BoSox' fortunes began to change in when <a href="Tom%20Yawkey">Tom Yawkey</a> bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher <a href="Wes%20Ferrell">Wes Ferrell</a> and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, <a href="Lefty%20Grove">Lefty Grove</a>, making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired <a href="Joe%20Cronin">Joe Cronin</a>, an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a> whose 50 home runs in 1938 would stand as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.

In , the Red Sox purchased the contract of <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a> from the minor league <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29">San Diego Padres</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>, ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the "Ted Sox." Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called "Williamsburg." Before this addition, it was over to right field. He served two stints in the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> as a pilot and saw <a href="active%20duty">active duty</a> in both World War II and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book "The Science of Hitting" is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in . Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them "The Knights of the Keyboard", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.

With Williams, the Red Sox reached the <a href="1946%20World%20Series">1946 World Series</a>, but lost to the <a href="1946%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in seven games in part because of the use of the "Williams Shift", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 <a href="At%20bat">at-bats</a> for a .200 average.

The Cardinals won the Series when <a href="Enos%20Slaughter">Enos Slaughter</a> scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a <a href="Hit%20%28baseball%29">base hit</a> to left field. The throw from <a href="Leon%20Culberson">Leon Culberson</a> was cut off by shortstop <a href="Johnny%20Pesky">Johnny Pesky</a>, who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or "held the ball" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.

Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman <a href="Bobby%20Doerr">Bobby Doerr</a> and center fielder <a href="Dom%20DiMaggio">Dom DiMaggio</a> (the younger brother of <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>).

The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in and . In <a href="1948%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1948</a>, <a href="1948%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston</a> finished in a tie with <a href="1948%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland</a>, and their loss to Cleveland in a <a href="one-game%20playoff">one-game playoff</a> ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joseph McCarthy</a> chose journeyman <a href="Denny%20Galehouse">Denny Galehouse</a> to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom <a href="Mel%20Parnell">Mel Parnell</a> was available to pitch. In <a href="1949%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1949</a>, the <a href="1949%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> were one game ahead of the <a href="1949%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a>, with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.

The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in , many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup "Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs." <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time. <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a> also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, <a href="Frank%20Malzone">Frank Malzone</a> debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in , but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the <a href="1960%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a>, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the <a href="John%20Updike">John Updike</a> story "Hub fans bid Kid adieu." The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an <a href="African%20American">African American</a> player when they promoted <a href="infielder">infielder</a> <a href="Pumpsie%20Green">Pumpsie Green</a> from their AAA <a href="farm%20team">farm team</a> in .

The 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl "Yaz" Yastrzemski</a>, Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.

Red Sox fans know as the <a href="1967%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">season</a> of the "Impossible Dream." The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical play</a> "<a href="Man%20of%20La%20Mancha">Man of La Mancha</a>". <a href="1967%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1967</a> saw one of the great pennant races in <a href="History%20of%20baseball">baseball history</a> with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the <a href="1966%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a> in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team went to the <a href="1967%20World%20Series">1967 World Series</a>, only to lose the Series to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in seven games. Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s and 121 RBIs. He finished one vote short of a unanimous MVP selection, as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Tovar">César Tovar</a> first on his ballot. But the Red Sox lost the series—again to the St. Louis Cardinals, in seven games. Legendary pitcher <a href="Bob%20Gibson">Bob Gibson</a> stymied the Red Sox winning three games.

An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named <a href="Tony%20Conigliaro">Tony Conigliaro</a> slugged 24 home runs in . "Tony C" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. He was struck just above the left <a href="Zygomatic%20bone">cheek bone</a> by a fastball thrown by <a href="Jack%20Hamilton%20%28baseball%29">Jack Hamilton</a> of the <a href="1967%20California%20Angels%20season">California Angels</a> on Friday, August 18, and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in , he was never the same.

Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was , when they lost by a half-game to the <a href="1972%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a>. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.

The Red Sox won the AL pennant in . The <a href="1975%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">1975 Red Sox</a> were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders <a href="Jim%20Rice">Jim Rice</a> and <a href="Fred%20Lynn">Fred Lynn</a>, veteran outfielder <a href="Dwight%20Evans">Dwight Evans</a>, <a href="catcher">catcher</a> <a href="Carlton%20Fisk">Carlton Fisk</a>, and pitchers <a href="Luis%20Tiant">Luis Tiant</a> and eccentric junkballer <a href="Bill%20Lee%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Bill "The Spaceman" Lee</a>. Fred Lynn won both the American League <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year</a> award and the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until <a href="Ichiro%20Suzuki">Ichiro Suzuki</a> did it in . In the <a href="1975%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1975 American League Championship Series</a>, the Red Sox swept the <a href="1975%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland A's</a>.

In the <a href="1975%20World%20Series">1975 World Series</a>, they faced the heavily favored <a href="1975%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a>, also known as <a href="The%20Big%20Red%20Machine">The Big Red Machine</a>. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> <a href="Bernie%20Carbo">Bernie Carbo</a> hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman <a href="Rawly%20Eastwick">Rawly Eastwick</a> to tie the game. In the top of the eleventh inning, <a href="right%20fielder">right fielder</a> Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a <a href="Joe%20Morgan">Joe Morgan</a> line drive and doubled <a href="Ken%20Griffey%2C%20Sr.">Ken Griffey</a> at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the <a href="Green%20Monster">Green Monster</a>. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7–6.

The Red Sox lost game 7, 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a "Leephus pitch" or "space ball" to Reds first baseman <a href="Tony%20P%C3%A9rez">Tony Pérez</a> who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, "We won that thing 3 games to 4."

In , the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were <a href="games%20behind">games behind</a> the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as "The Boston Massacre"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.

On September 16 the Yankees held a game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one—with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the <a href="1978%20Toronto%20Blue%20Jays%20season">Toronto Blue Jays</a> clinching the division. However, <a href="1978%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York</a> lost 9–2 and Boston won 5–0, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.

The most remembered moment from the game was <a href="Bucky%20Dent">Bucky Dent</a>'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead. The dejected Boston manager, <a href="Don%20Zimmer">Don Zimmer</a>, gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: "Bucky F**king Dent!" <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a> provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to <a href="Graig%20Nettles">Graig Nettles</a> in foul territory with <a href="Rick%20Burleson">Rick Burleson</a> representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.

Carl Yastrzemski retired after the season, during which the <a href="1983%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since .

However, in , it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change. The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, <a href="Don%20Baylor">Don Baylor</a> and <a href="Wade%20Boggs">Wade Boggs</a>. <a href="Roger%20Clemens">Roger Clemens</a> led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 <a href="Earned%20run%20average">ERA</a>, and had a 20-strikeout game to win both the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young</a> and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since <a href="Vida%20Blue">Vida Blue</a> in . Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander <a href="Bruce%20Hurst">Bruce Hurst</a> went 13-8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> and <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> from the 1960s <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>.

The <a href="1986%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the <a href="1986%20California%20Angels%20season">California Angels</a> in the <a href="1986%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3–1 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, <a href="Dave%20Henderson">Dave Henderson</a> homered off <a href="Donnie%20Moore">Donnie Moore</a> to put Boston up 6–5. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.

The Red Sox faced a heavily favored <a href="1986%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a> team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the <a href="1986%20World%20Series">1986 World Series</a>. Boston won the first two games in <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 would go down as one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3–2 lead. Years later, Manager <a href="John%20McNamara%20%28baseball%29">John McNamara</a> said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied. The Mets then scored a run off <a href="relief%20pitcher">reliever</a> and former Met <a href="Calvin%20Schiraldi">Calvin Schiraldi</a> to tie the score 3–3. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman <a href="Marty%20Barrett%20%28second%20baseman%29">Marty Barrett</a>.

After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20NBC">NBC telecast</a> hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and <a href="Bruce%20Hurst">Bruce Hurst</a> as World Series MVP. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher <a href="Gary%20Carter">Gary Carter</a> hit a single. It was followed by singles by <a href="Kevin%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Kevin Mitchell</a> and <a href="Ray%20Knight">Ray Knight</a>. With <a href="Mookie%20Wilson">Mookie Wilson</a> batting, a wild pitch by <a href="Bob%20Stanley%20%28baseball%29">Bob Stanley</a> tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through <a href="Bill%20Buckner">Bill Buckner</a>'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.

While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers—as well as both Wilson and Buckner—have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would still have been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.

Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that <a href="Dave%20Stapleton%20%28infielder%29">Dave Stapleton</a> had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3–0, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were "cursed."

This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager <a href="Lou%20Gorman">Lou Gorman</a> was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM <a href="Frank%20Cashen">Frank Cashen</a>, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.

The <a href="1988%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> returned to the postseason in . With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole, Massachusetts, resident and longtime minor-league manager <a href="Joe%20Morgan%20%28manager%29">Joe Morgan</a> on July 15. Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as "Morgan Magic". But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the <a href="1988%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> in the <a href="1988%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player <a href="Dennis%20Eckersley">Dennis Eckersley</a>, who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in , the <a href="1990%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> would again win the division and face the <a href="1990%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Athletics</a> in the <a href="1990%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight.

In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant "1918!" to taunt the Red Sox. The demeaning chant would echo at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> each time the Red Sox were there. Also, Fenway Park became the scene of <a href="Bucky%20Dent">Bucky Dent</a>'s worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph. In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager. Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat. However, <a href="Dan%20Shaughnessy">Dan Shaughnessy</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" severely criticized Yankees Owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should "have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore" to fire Dent. He said that "if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook." "The firing was only special because ... it's the first time a Yankee manager—who was also a Red Sox demon—was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay."

Tom Yawkey died in , and his wife <a href="Jean%20R.%20Yawkey">Jean R. Yawkey</a> took control of the team until her death in . Their initials are shown in two stripes on the <a href="Green%20Monster">left field wall</a> in <a href="Morse%20code">Morse code</a>. Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by <a href="John%20Harrington%20%28Red%20Sox%20CEO%29">John Harrington</a>. The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.

In , General Manager <a href="Lou%20Gorman">Lou Gorman</a> was replaced by <a href="Dan%20Duquette">Dan Duquette</a>, a Massachusetts native who had worked for the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>. Duquette revived the team's <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">farm system</a>, which during his tenure produced players such as <a href="Nomar%20Garciaparra">Nomar Garciaparra</a>, <a href="Carl%20Pavano">Carl Pavano</a> and <a href="David%20Eckstein">David Eckstein</a>. Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an 8-year, $160 million deal for <a href="Manny%20Ram%C3%ADrez">Manny Ramírez</a> after the <a href="2000%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a>.

The <a href="1995%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a> won the newly realigned <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> in , finishing seven games ahead of the <a href="1995%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a>. However, they were swept in three games in the <a href="1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> by the <a href="1995%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a>. Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.

Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 <a href="1996%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a> on September 18, in what would prove to be one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform. After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993–96, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering "the twilight of his career". Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards.

Out of contention in , the team traded closer <a href="Heathcliff%20Slocumb">Heathcliff Slocumb</a> to Seattle for catching prospect <a href="Jason%20Varitek">Jason Varitek</a> and right-handed pitcher <a href="Derek%20Lowe">Derek Lowe</a>. Prior to the start of the <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a>, the Red Sox dealt pitchers <a href="Tony%20Armas%2C%20Jr.">Tony Armas, Jr.</a> and <a href="Carl%20Pavano">Carl Pavano</a> to the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> for pitcher <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a>. Martínez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the <a href="1998%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">team</a> won the American League <a href="MLB%20Wild%20Card">Wild Card</a>, but again lost the <a href="1998%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> to the <a href="1998%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a>.

In , Duquette called Fenway Park "economically obsolete" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.

On the field, the <a href="1999%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">1999 Red Sox</a> were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. <a href="1999%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland</a> took a 2–0 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez and his brother <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20%28pitcher%29">Ramón Martínez</a>. Game 4's 23–7 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5–2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12–8 win behind two home runs and seven RBIs from outfielder <a href="Troy%20O%27Leary">Troy O'Leary</a>. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.

In , the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to <a href="New%20England%20Sports%20Ventures">New England Sports Ventures</a>, a consortium headed by principal owner <a href="John%20Henry%20%28baseball%29">John Henry</a>. <a href="Tom%20Werner">Tom Werner</a> served as executive chairman, <a href="Larry%20Lucchino">Larry Lucchino</a> served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was <a href="Les%20Otten">Les Otten</a>. <a href="Dan%20Duquette">Dan Duquette</a> was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM <a href="Mike%20Port">Mike Port</a> taking the helm for the <a href="2002%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">2002 season</a>. A week later, manager <a href="Joe%20Kerrigan">Joe Kerrigan</a> was fired and was replaced by <a href="Grady%20Little">Grady Little</a>.

While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder <a href="Johnny%20Damon">Johnny Damon</a> away from the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>, the new ownership made additions such as outfielder <a href="Cliff%20Floyd">Cliff Floyd</a> and relief pitcher <a href="Alan%20Embree">Alan Embree</a>. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramírez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Martínez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games—becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.

After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> graduate <a href="Theo%20Epstein">Theo Epstein</a>. Epstein, raised in <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline, Massachusetts</a>, and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.
The <a href="2003%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">2003 team</a> was known as the "Cowboy Up" team, a nickname derived from first baseman <a href="Kevin%20Millar">Kevin Millar</a>'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination. In the <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2003 American League Division Series</a>, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit against the <a href="2003%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Athletics</a> to win the best-of-five series. Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory. The team then faced the <a href="2003%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> in the <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2003 American League Championship Series</a>. In Game 7, Boston led 5–2 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game. The Red Sox could not score off <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman <a href="Aaron%20Boone">Aaron Boone</a> hit a solo home run off of <a href="Tim%20Wakefield">Tim Wakefield</a>. Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little for failing to remove starting pitcher Martínez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring. Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS. Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> manager <a href="Terry%20Francona">Terry Francona</a>.

During the 2003–04 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, <a href="Curt%20Schilling">Curt Schilling</a>, and a closer, <a href="Keith%20Foulke">Keith Foulke</a>. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop <a href="Nomar%20Garciaparra">Nomar Garciaparra</a> and outfielder <a href="Matt%20Murton">Matt Murton</a> to the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, and received first baseman <a href="Doug%20Mientkiewicz">Doug Mientkiewicz</a> from the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, and shortstop <a href="Orlando%20Cabrera">Orlando Cabrera</a> from the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder <a href="Dave%20Roberts%20%28outfielder%29">Dave Roberts</a> from the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as "the Idiots", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed "curse."

Boston began the postseason by sweeping the <a href="American%20League%20West">AL West</a> champion <a href="2004%20Anaheim%20Angels%20season">Anaheim Angels</a> in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> against the <a href="2004%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a>. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19-8 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by <a href="Bill%20Mueller">Bill Mueller</a>, sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning, who also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in game 7 with a 10–3 defeat of the Yankees. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the <a href="1941%E2%80%9342%20Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs%20season">1942 Toronto Maple Leafs</a> and <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20New%20York%20Islanders%20season">1975 New York Islanders</a> as the only <a href="professional%20sports">professional sports</a> teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none. The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Philadelphia%20Flyers%20season">2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers</a> (against the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Boston%20Bruins%20season">Boston Bruins</a>) and the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Los%20Angeles%20Kings%20season">2013–14 Los Angeles Kings</a> (against the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20San%20Jose%20Sharks%20season">San Jose Sharks</a>) would also accomplish the feat.

The Red Sox swept the <a href="2004%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis Cardinals</a> in the <a href="2004%20World%20Series">2004 World Series</a>. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; <a href="Mark%20Bellhorn">Mark Bellhorn</a> hit a game-winning home run off <a href="Pesky%27s%20Pole">Pesky's Pole</a> in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and <a href="Derek%20Lowe">Derek Lowe</a>. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ramírez was named <a href="World%20Series%20MVP">World Series MVP</a>. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a <a href="total%20lunar%20eclipse">total lunar eclipse</a> colored the moon red over <a href="Busch%20Memorial%20Stadium">Busch Stadium</a>. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their incredible season, such as in December, when "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsmen of the Year</a>.

The AL East would be decided on the last weekend of the season, with the <a href="2005%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95–67. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a Wild Card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the Wild Card. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual <a href="2005%20World%20Series">2005 World Series</a> champion <a href="2005%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> in the <a href="2005%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">first round</a> of the playoffs. In <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> broke <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a>'s single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9–21 record in the month of August due to several injuries in club's roster. 

Theo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese <a href="Nippon%20Professional%20Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> superstar pitcher <a href="Daisuke%20Matsuzaka">Daisuke Matsuzaka</a>. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.

The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman <a href="Dustin%20Pedroia">Dustin Pedroia</a> under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager <a href="Terry%20Francona">Terry Francona</a> refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">AL Rookie of the Year Award</a> for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, <a href="Josh%20Beckett">Josh Beckett</a> emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and <a href="Juli%C3%A1n%20Tav%C3%A1rez">Julián Tavárez</a> all struggled at times. Relief pitcher <a href="Hideki%20Okajima">Hideki Okajima</a>, another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up <a href="Clay%20Buchholz">Clay Buchholz</a> provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.
The Red Sox swept the <a href="2007%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Angels</a> in the <a href="2007%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. Facing the <a href="2007%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> in the <a href="2007%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the <a href="2007%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">Colorado Rockies</a> in the <a href="2007%20World%20Series">2007 World Series</a>, and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered <a href="Jon%20Lester">Jon Lester</a>, who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman <a href="Mike%20Lowell">Mike Lowell</a> and pinch-hitter <a href="Bobby%20Kielty">Bobby Kielty</a> secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named World Series MVP.

The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the <a href="2008%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland A's</a> in the <a href="Tokyo%20Dome">Tokyo Dome</a>. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the <a href="2008%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a> 7–0. Down the stretch, outfielder <a href="Manny%20Ramirez">Manny Ramirez</a> became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> that landed them <a href="Jason%20Bay">Jason Bay</a> to replace him in left field. With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. The Red Sox defeated the <a href="2008%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Angels</a> in the <a href="2008%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2008 ALDS</a> three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the <a href="2008%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Rays</a> in the <a href="2008%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>. Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7-0 in the 7th inning to win 8-7. They tied the series at 3 games apiece with a game 6 victory before losing game 7, 3–1, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as world champions.

The Red Sox returned to postseason play the following season, but were swept by the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Los Angeles Angels</a> in three games. In 2011, the Red Sox collapsed in the month of September losing 11 of 14, reminiscent of 1978 and destroying their playoff aspirations. In December 2011, <a href="Bobby%20Valentine">Bobby Valentine</a> was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. finished 69–93 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.

Boston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69–93 record in 2012–26 games behind the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">Yankees</a>, became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L. East division title on September 21, 2013. Many credit the team's turnaround with the hiring of manager <a href="John%20Farrell%20%28pitcher%29">John Farrell</a>, the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007 to 2010. As a former member of the staff, he had the respect of influential players such as Lester, Pedroia, and Ortiz. But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager <a href="Ben%20Cherington">Ben Cherington</a> who targeted "character" players to fill the team's needs. These acquisitions included veteran catcher <a href="David%20Ross%20%28baseball%29">David Ross</a>, <a href="Jonny%20Gomes">Jonny Gomes</a>, <a href="Mike%20Napoli">Mike Napoli</a>, and <a href="Shane%20Victorino">Shane Victorino</a>. While some questioned these players as "re-treads", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011–2012 by bringing in "clubhouse players". Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran <a href="John%20Lackey">John Lackey</a> coming off <a href="Tommy%20John%20surgery">Tommy John surgery</a> and both Jon Lester and <a href="Clay%20Buchholz">Clay Buchholz</a> returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closers</a>, <a href="Joel%20Hanrahan">Joel Hanrahan</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Bailey%20%28baseball%29">Andrew Bailey</a>, went down early with season-ending injuries. Farrell gave the closing job to <a href="Koji%20Uehara">Koji Uehara</a> on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 <a href="Walks%20plus%20hits%20per%20inning%20pitched">WHIP</a>. On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters. Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher <a href="Jake%20Peavy">Jake Peavy</a> when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East, the depth of the bench with players such as <a href="Mike%20Carp">Mike Carp</a> and rookies <a href="Jackie%20Bradley%2C%20Jr.">Jackie Bradley, Jr.</a> and <a href="Xander%20Bogaerts">Xander Bogaerts</a>, and the re-emergence of players such as <a href="Will%20Middlebrooks">Will Middlebrooks</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Nava">Daniel Nava</a>. On September 28, 2013, the team secured <a href="home%20field%20advantage">home field advantage</a> throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition, the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>, lost. The next day, the team finished the season going 97–65, the best record in the American League and tied with the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> for the best record in baseball. They proceeded to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the <a href="2013%20World%20Series">2013 World Series</a>, four games to two. The Red Sox became the first team since the <a href="1991%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">1991 Minnesota Twins</a> to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place, and the second overall. The 2012 Red Sox' .426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship.
Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of <a href="Boston">Boston</a> and its people in relation to the <a href="Boston%20Marathon%20bombings">Boston Marathon bombings</a> that occurred on April 15, 2013. On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, "This is our fucking city! And nobody is going to dictate our freedom! Stay strong!" For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox "B" logo and the word "Strong" within a blue circle. The team also hung up in the <a href="dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugout</a> a custom jersey that read "Boston Strong" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's <a href="area%20code">area code</a>. On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial <a href="first%20pitch">first pitch</a>. Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional <a href="duck%20tour">duck boat</a> victory <a href="parade">parade</a>, in which they placed the <a href="World%20Series%20trophy">World Series trophy</a> and the custom 617 jersey on the <a href="Boston%20Marathon">Boston Marathon</a> finish line on <a href="Boylston%20Street">Boylston Street</a>, followed by a moment of silence and a singing of <a href="God%20Bless%20America">God Bless America</a>. This ceremony helped the city "reclaim" its spirit that was lost after the bombing. Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team's unifying effect on the city.

Following the 2013 championship, the team finished last in the AL East during 2014 with a record of 71–91, and again in 2015 with a record of 78–84. On September 20, 2015, <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> hit his 500th career home run off <a href="Matt%20Moore%20%28baseball%29">Matt Moore</a> in <a href="Tropicana%20Field">Tropicana Field</a> becoming the 27th player in MLB history to achieve that prestigious milestone; in November 2015, Ortiz announced that the 2016 season would be his last.

The Red Sox had a record of 93–69 and won their division in 2016, with six American League All-Stars, the AL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> winner in <a href="Rick%20Porcello">Rick Porcello</a>, and the runner-up for the AL <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a>, <a href="Mookie%20Betts">Mookie Betts</a>. Rookie <a href="Andrew%20Benintendi">Andrew Benintendi</a> established himself in the Red Sox' outfield, and <a href="Steven%20Wright%20%28baseball%29">Steven Wright</a> emerged as one of the year's biggest surprises. The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the AL East early and held on to it throughout the year, which included many teams honoring Ortiz throughout the season. Despite the success, the team lost five of their last six games of the regular season and were swept in the <a href="2016%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> by the eventual American League Champion <a href="2016%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a>.

The unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the Sox spring training facility in Florida.

Former <a href="left%20fielder">left fielder</a> <a href="Mike%20Greenwell">Mike Greenwell</a> is from <a href="Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Fort Myers, Florida</a> and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a>. <a href="City%20of%20Palms%20Park">City of Palms Park</a> was built in for that purpose and holds 8,000 people. It is also the home of the Red Sox Rookie team, the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20League%20Red%20Sox">Gulf Coast League Red Sox</a>, from April through June.

On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. Commissioner Brian Bigelow was the lone dissenting vote. Commissioner Bob Janes was not present for the vote, but stated that he supported it.

Dee was present in the chambers for the vote, and took the agreement back to Boston to meet with John Henry and other team officials. On November 1, 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County that will keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years.

Wednesday, April 30, 2009, the Lee County commissioners selected the Watermen-Pinnacle site on Daniels Parkway (a little more than a mile east of Interstate 75) as the site for the new facility. The backup choice, if negotiations between county staff and the developer falter, is the University Highland site just north of <a href="Germain%20Arena">Germain Arena</a> in <a href="Estero%2C%20Florida">Estero</a>. Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers architect who is volunteering his time toward the project, envisions a facility with a mini-<a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> that would open for Spring 2012.

On March 29, 2011, it was announced that the new field would be named <a href="JetBlue%20Park">JetBlue Park</a> at Fenway South. The park was named JetBlue Park after <a href="JetBlue%20Airlines">JetBlue Airlines</a>, which has maintained major operations at Boston's <a href="Logan%20International%20Airport">Logan International Airport</a> since 2004.

Many characteristics of the stadium will be taken from <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, including a <a href="Green%20Monster">Green Monster</a> wall in left field, featuring seating on top of and behind the wall. Included in the wall will be a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s. The field dimensions at JetBlue Park will be identical to those at Fenway.

The Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest <a href="List%20of%20sports%20rivalries">rivalries in professional sport</a>s. For over 100 years, the Red Sox and <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> have been rivals.

The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern United States</a>. Since the inception of the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">wild card</a> team and an added Division Series, every playoffs has featured one or both of the <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> rivals and they both have squared off in the <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> three times, with the Yankees winning twice in <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1999</a> and <a href="2003%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2003</a> and the Sox winning in <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2004</a>. In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in (when the Red Sox won) and (when the Yankees won).

The teams also finished tied for first in , when the Yankees won a high-profile <a href="1978%20American%20League%20East%20tie-breaker%20game">one-game playoff</a> for the division title. The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series. The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series.

The rivalry is often termed "the best" and "greatest rivalry in all of sports." Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television.

Currently, the <a href="flagship%20station">flagship</a> <a href="radio%20station">radio station</a> of the Red Sox is <a href="WEEI-FM">WEEI-FM</a>/93.7. <a href="Joe%20Castiglione">Joe Castiglione</a>, in his 25th year as the voice of the Red Sox, serves as the lead <a href="play-by-play">play-by-play</a> announcer, along with <a href="Dave%20O%27Brien%20%28sportscaster%29">Dave O'Brien</a> and <a href="Jon%20Rish">Jon Rish</a>. Some of Castiglione's predecessors include <a href="Curt%20Gowdy">Curt Gowdy</a>, <a href="Ken%20Coleman">Ken Coleman</a>, and <a href="Ned%20Martin">Ned Martin</a>. He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and <a href="Jerry%20Trupiano">Jerry Trupiano</a>. Many stations throughout <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and beyond pick up the broadcasts.

All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Fox</a> or <a href="ESPN%20Major%20League%20Baseball">ESPN</a> are seen on <a href="New%20England%20Sports%20Network">New England Sports Network</a> (NESN), until 2015 with <a href="Don%20Orsillo">Don Orsillo</a> calling play-by-play and <a href="Jerry%20Remy">Jerry Remy</a>, former Red Sox <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a>, as <a href="color%20analyst">color analyst</a>. At the start of the 2016 season, <a href="Dave%20O%27Brien%20%28sportscaster%29">Dave O'Brien</a> took over the play-by-play duties. During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players <a href="Dennis%20Eckersley">Dennis Eckersley</a> and <a href="Dave%20Roberts%20%28outfielder%29">Dave Roberts</a> have alternated doing color commentary. NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as <a href="WHDH-TV%20%28defunct%29">the original WHDH-TV</a>, <a href="WHDH%20%28TV%29">WNAC-TV</a> (now the current WHDH), <a href="WBZ-TV">WBZ-TV</a>, <a href="WSBK-TV">WSBK-TV</a>, <a href="WLVI">WLVI</a>, <a href="WBPX">WABU</a>, and <a href="WFXT">WFXT</a> at various points in team history.

The Red Sox used to publish on their website and their annual media guides three official requirements for a player to have his number retired:

These requirements were reconsidered after the election of <a href="Carlton%20Fisk">Carlton Fisk</a> to the Hall of Fame in 2000; who met the first two requirements but played the second half of his career with the White Sox. As a means of meeting the criteria, then-GM Dan Duquette hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox.

In 2008, the Red Sox made an "exception" by retiring #6 for <a href="Johnny%20Pesky">Johnny Pesky</a>. Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited "... his versatility of his contributions—on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout ...", including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned. Pesky spent 55 years with the Red Sox organization; as a player (1942, 1946-1952), minor league manager (1961-1962, 1990), major league manager (1963-1964, 1980), broadcaster (1969-1974), major league coach (1975-1984), and as a special instructor and assistant general manager (1985-2012).

In 2015, the Red Sox chose to forgo the official criteria and retire <a href="Pedro%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Pedro Martínez</a>'s #45. Martínez only spent 7 of his 18 seasons in Boston. In justifying the number's retirement, Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, "To be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro's outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him." After which, the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website nor future media guides.

In 2017, less than eight months after he played the final game of his illustrious career, <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> had his #34 retired by the Red Sox. Ortiz will not be eligible for election to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a> until 2021. Ortiz is the only Red Sox player to have won 3 <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championships since the issuance of jersey numbers starting in 1931.

The number 42 was officially retired by <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> in , but <a href="Mo%20Vaughn">Mo Vaughn</a> was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a <a href="grandfather%20clause">grandfather clause</a>. He last wore it for the team in . In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, <a href="Coco%20Crisp">Coco Crisp</a> (CF), <a href="David%20Ortiz">David Ortiz</a> (DH), and <a href="DeMarlo%20Hale">DeMarlo Hale</a> (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008. Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.

While not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them, specifically:

There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of <a href="Tony%20Conigliaro">Tony Conigliaro</a>'s number 25. Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has continued to be issued to individuals, including players <a href="Orlando%20Cepeda">Orlando Cepeda</a>, <a href="Steve%20Renko">Steve Renko</a>, <a href="Mark%20Clear">Mark Clear</a>, <a href="Ed%20Romero">Ed Romero</a>, <a href="Don%20Baylor">Don Baylor</a>, <a href="Larry%20Parrish">Larry Parrish</a>, <a href="Jack%20Clark%20%28baseball%29">Jack Clark</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Russell">Jeff Russell</a>, <a href="Troy%20O%27Leary">Troy O'Leary</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Giambi">Jeremy Giambi</a>, <a href="Ellis%20Burks">Ellis Burks</a>, <a href="Adam%20Hyzdu">Adam Hyzdu</a>, <a href="Mike%20Lowell">Mike Lowell</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Bradley%2C%20Jr.">Jackie Bradley, Jr.</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Kendrick">Kyle Kendrick</a> and <a href="Rajai%20Davis">Rajai Davis</a>; coach <a href="Dwight%20Evans">Dwight Evans</a>, and manager <a href="Bobby%20Valentine">Bobby Valentine</a>.

Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9–4–1–8. It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the <a href="1918%20World%20Series">1918 World Series</a>, the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order. In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14) followed by Robinson's 42. As additional numbers are retired (e.g.: Pedro's 45, Boggs's 26, Papi's 34), Robinson's 42 is moved to the right so it remains the right-most number hanging.

Baltimore Orioles

The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> team based in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. The Orioles compete in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) as a member of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="American%20League%20East">East</a> division. As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> to become the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>. After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist <a href="Clarence%20Miles">Clarence Miles</a> and Mayor <a href="Thomas%20D%27Alesandro%2C%20Jr.">Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.</a> The team's current majority owner is lawyer <a href="Peter%20Angelos">Peter Angelos</a>.

The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the <a href="Baltimore%20oriole">official state bird of Maryland</a>; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including the team that moved and was later renamed the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. <a href="List%20of%20baseball%20nicknames">Nicknames</a> for the team include the "O's" and the "Birds".

The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983, when they made six <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> appearances, winning three of them (<a href="1966%20World%20Series">1966</a>, <a href="1970%20World%20Series">1970</a>, <a href="1983%20World%20Series">1983</a>). This era saw the club feature several future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famers</a> who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as <a href="third%20baseman">third baseman</a> <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a>, <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a>, <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> <a href="Jim%20Palmer">Jim Palmer</a>, <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a>, <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a>, and <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a>. The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships (1969–1971, 1973–1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">pennants</a> (1966, 1969–1971, 1979, 1983), and three <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild%20card">wild card</a> berths (1996, 2012, 2016). 

After suffering a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, the team has qualified for the postseason three times since 2012 under manager <a href="Buck%20Showalter">Buck Showalter</a>, including a division title and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 17 years in 2014. The Orioles are also well known for their successful stadium, the trend-setting <a href="Oriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a>, which opened in 1992 in <a href="downtown%20Baltimore">downtown Baltimore</a>.

The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor</a> <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>, beginning in 1894, when the league reorganized. The Brewers were there when the WL renamed itself the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> in 1900.

At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues). Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league. As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>). In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the <a href="1901%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a> 14–13 after blowing a nine-run lead in the 9th inning. To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game. During the first American League season in 1901, they finished last (eighth place) with a record of 48–89. Its lone Major League season, the team played at <a href="Lloyd%20Street%20Grounds">Lloyd Street Grounds</a>, between 16th and 18th Streets in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>.

After one year in Milwaukee the club relocated to St Louis, and for a while enjoyed some success, especially in the 1920s behind Hall of Fame first baseman <a href="George%20Sisler">George Sisler</a>. However, the team's fortunes declined from then on, as playing success and gate receipts instead went increasingly to the Browns' own tenants at <a href="Sportsman%27s%20Park">Sportsman's Park</a>, the National League <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">Cardinals</a>. During this period the Browns only won one pennant, in the 1944 season stocked with wartime replacement players, and lost to the Cardinals in the third and last World Series ever played entirely in one ballpark. In 1921 and 1922 the New York Giants and the New York Yankees played the entire World Series at the Polo Grounds in New York. In 1953, with the Browns unable to afford even stadium upkeep, owner Bill Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cards and attempted to move the club back to Milwaukee, but this was vetoed by the other Major League owners. Instead, Veeck sold his franchise to a partnership of Baltimore businessmen.

The Miles-Krieger (<a href="Gunther%20Brewing%20Company">Gunther Brewing Company</a>)-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles soon after taking control of the franchise. The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by a <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%2819th%20century%29">National League team</a> in the 1890s. In 1901, Baltimore and McGraw were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing American League, naming the team the Orioles. After a battle with Ban Johnson, the Head of the American League in 1902, McGraw took many of the top players including Walter Scott "Steve" Brodie, Dan McGann, Roger Bresnahan and Joe McGinnity to the New York Giants. As an affront to Johnson, McGraw kept the black and orange colors of the New York Giants, which San Francisco wears to this day. In 1903, the rest of the team was transferred to New York where they were nicknamed the Highlanders until circa 1912, by which time Yanks or Yankees had taken over as their popular monicker. As a member of the high-minor league level <a href="International%20League">International League</a>, the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">Orioles</a> competed at what is now known as the AAA level from 1903 to 1953; the IL Orioles' most famous player was a local Baltimore product, a hard-hitting lefthanded pitcher named <a href="Babe%20Ruth">George Herman Ruth</a>. When Oriole Park burned down in 1944, the team moved to a temporary home, <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Municipal Stadium</a>, where they won the Junior World Series. Their large postseason crowds caught the attention of the major leagues, eventually leading to a new MLB franchise in Baltimore.

After starting the <a href="1954%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1954 campaign</a> with a two-game split against the <a href="1954%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Tigers</a> in <a href="Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29">Detroit</a>, the <a href="1954%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> returned to Baltimore on April 15 to a welcoming parade that wound through the streets of <a href="Downtown%20Baltimore">downtown</a>, with an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the route. In its first-ever home opener at <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Memorial Stadium</a> later in the afternoon, they treated a sellout crowd of 46,354 to a 3–1 victory over the <a href="1954%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a>. The remainder of the season would not be as pleasant, with the team enduring 100 losses while avoiding the AL cellar by only three games. With fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the franchise's business operations and dissatisfied with yet another seventh-place finish, Clarence Miles resigned in early November 1955. Real estate developer <a href="James%20Keelty">James Keelty, Jr.</a> succeeded him as president with investment banker <a href="Joseph%20Iglehart">Joseph Iglehart</a> the new board chairman.

The seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired <a href="Paul%20Richards%20%28baseball%29">Paul Richards</a> to become the ballclub's manager and general manager. He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the Oriole Way. The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization. Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level.

For the remainder of the 1950s, the Orioles crawled up the standings, reaching as high as fifth place with a <a href="1957%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">76–76</a> record in 1957. Richards succeeded in stocking the franchise with a plethora of young talent which included <a href="Dave%20Nicholson">Dave Nicholson</a>, <a href="Pete%20Ward">Pete Ward</a>, <a href="Ron%20Hansen%20%28baseball%29">Ron Hansen</a> (1960 AL <a href="Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20%28award%29">Rookie of the Year</a>), <a href="Milt%20Pappas">Milt Pappas</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Adair">Jerry Adair</a>, <a href="Steve%20Barber">Steve Barber</a> (20 wins in 1963), <a href="Boog%20Powell">Boog Powell</a>, <a href="Dave%20McNally">Dave McNally</a> and <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a>. Unfortunately, Richards also had the tendency to recklessly spend money on individuals with dubious baseball skills. This became a major problem as bidding wars between the ballclubs to land the best amateur players escalated signing bonuses.

The solution came on November 5, 1958, when <a href="Lee%20MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a> was appointed general manager, allowing Richards to focus on his managerial duties. MacPhail added much needed discipline to the <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scouting</a> staff by establishing cross-checkers who thoroughly evaluated young hopefuls to determine whether they were worthy of being tendered a contract. He also accepted the title of president after Keelty resigned in mid-December 1959.

One month prior to the end of the 1961 season, Richards resigned as the team's skipper to become the general manager of the expansion <a href="Houston%20Colt%20.45s">Houston Colt .45s</a>. A <a href="1960%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">year earlier</a>, he succeeded in establishing the <a href="1960%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> as a legitimate contender when they stood atop the AL standings as late as early September before finishing in second place at 89–65.

In 1964, the <a href="1964%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Birds</a>, piloted by <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a> in his first year of managing the ballclub, were involved in a tight pennant race against the <a href="1964%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> and <a href="1964%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">White Sox</a>. They ended up in third place with a 97–65 record, only two games out. It has been suggested that they would likely have advanced to the <a href="1964%20World%20Series">Fall Classic</a> had it not been for a minor wrist injury that sidelined Powell for two weeks in late August. Nevertheless, Robinson enjoyed a breakout season with a league-high 118 RBIs and won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">AL Most Valuable Player Award</a>.

The television/radio network of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>' purchase of a majority stake in the Yankees on September 9 of that same year resulted in a change to the ownership situation in Baltimore. Iglehart, the Orioles' largest shareholder at 32% and owner of a sizable amount of CBS stock, straightened out his conflict of interest issues on May 25, 1965 by selling his 64,000 shares in the ball-club to the <a href="National%20Bohemian">National Brewing Company</a>, an original team investor which finally had controlling interest at 65%. Brewery president <a href="Jerold%20Hoffberger">Jerold Hoffberger</a> became the Orioles' new chairman of the board. Hoffberger's first action was installing <a href="Frank%20Cashen">Frank Cashen</a>, the Director of Advertising for the National Brewery, as Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer for the Orioles.

With the benefit of a deep talent pool and superior scouts, the franchise continued to make improvements at the major league level. Three months before the start of the 1963 season, the <a href="1963%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> stabilized its infield by acquiring <a href="Luis%20Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a> in a transaction that involved sending a trio of homegrown players (Hansen, Nicholson and Ward) to the White Sox. They also scoured the minor leagues for selections in the <a href="Rule%205%20draft">Rule 5 draft</a> (<a href="Paul%20Blair%20%28baseball%29">Paul Blair</a> from the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">Mets</a> in 1962, <a href="Moe%20Drabowsky">Moe Drabowsky</a> from the Cardinals in 1965) and claims off waivers (<a href="Curt%20Blefary">Curt Blefary</a>, 1965 <a href="AL%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">AL Rookie of the Year</a>, from the Yankees in 1963).

On December 9, 1965, the Orioles traded pitcher <a href="Milt%20Pappas">Milt Pappas</a> (and several others) to the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> in exchange for slugging outfielder <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a>. The following year, Robinson won the <a href="American%20League%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">American League Most Valuable Player</a> award, thus becoming the first (and so far only) man to win the MVP in each league (Robinson won the NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant). In addition to winning the 1966 MVP, Robinson also won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Triple%20Crown">Triple Crown</a> (leading the American League in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in), a feat also achieved the following season by <a href="1962%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston's</a> <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a>. The <a href="1966%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> won their first-ever American League championship in 1966, and in a major upset, swept the <a href="1966%20World%20Series">World Series</a> by out-dueling the defending World Champion <a href="1966%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, whose pitching staff was led by aces <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> and <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a>. The only home run ball ever hit completely out of Memorial Stadium was slugged by Robinson on Mother's Day in 1966, off <a href="1966%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> pitcher <a href="Luis%20Tiant">Luis Tiant</a>. It cleared the left field single-deck portion of the grandstand. A flag was later erected near the spot the ball cleared the back wall, with simply the word "HERE" upon it. The flag is now in the Baltimore Orioles Museum.

Pappas went 30–29 in a little over two years with the Reds before being traded. Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> in 1971 and 1972, including a no-hitter in the latter season, this did not help the <a href="1970%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Reds</a>, who ended up losing the <a href="1970%20World%20Series">1970 World Series</a> to Robinson and the Orioles. This trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a> in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film "<a href="Bull%20Durham">Bull Durham</a>": "Bad trades are a part of baseball. I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?"

In the 1960s, the Orioles farm system produced an especially large number of high-quality players and coaches and laid the foundation for two decades of on-field success. This period included eighteen consecutive winning seasons (1968–1985) -- a run of success that saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball.

During this period, the Orioles played baseball the "Oriole Way", an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Sr.">Cal Ripken, Sr.</a>'s phrase "perfect practice makes perfect!" The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level. It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce "replacement parts" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment. Elaborations on the Oriole way include pitching coach and manager Ray Miller's maxim "Work fast, change speeds, and throw strikes" and manager Earl Weaver's maxim "Pitching, defense and three-run homers."
The "Oriole Way" began flourishing in 1966 after the Robinson-for-Pappas deal, as Robinson won the "Triple Crown Award". His Orioles would easily sweep the <a href="1966%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in the <a href="1966%20World%20Series">1966 World Series</a>. After a mediocre <a href="1967%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">1967 season</a>, <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a> would be replaced by <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a> halfway into 1968. The <a href="1968%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> would finish second in the American League. This would only be a prelude to 1969, when the <a href="1969%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> won 109 games and easily won the newly created <a href="American%20League%20East">American League East</a> division title. <a href="Mike%20Cuellar">Mike Cuellar</a> shared the <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a> with Detroit's <a href="Denny%20McLain">Denny McLain</a>. After sweeping <a href="1969%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Minnesota</a> in the <a href="1969%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a>, Baltimore was shocked by losing to the <a href="1969%20New%20York%20Mets%20season">New York Mets</a> in a five-game <a href="1969%20World%20Series">World Series</a>. The next year, <a href="Boog%20Powell">Boog Powell</a> won the MVP and the Orioles won another 108 games. After sweeping the <a href="1970%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Twins</a> once again in the <a href="1970%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, the Orioles won the <a href="1970%20World%20Series">1970 World Series</a> by defeating the <a href="1970%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a>' <a href="Big%20Red%20Machine">Big Red Machine</a> in five games.

In 1971, the <a href="1971%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> won another division title thanks to four 20-game winners on their pitching staff (Cuellar, <a href="Jim%20Palmer">Jim Palmer</a>, <a href="Pat%20Dobson">Pat Dobson</a>, and <a href="Dave%20McNally">Dave McNally</a>). After defeating the young <a href="1971%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland A's</a> in the <a href="1971%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, the Orioles would lose a heartbreaking seven-game <a href="1971%20World%20Series">World Series</a> to the <a href="1971%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. The <a href="1972%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> would miss the playoffs in 1972, but rebounded to win the division in 1973 and 1974. Each time, they would lose to Oakland in the ALCS. During this stretch, the Orioles began to phase out their veteran infield by replacing <a href="Davey%20Johnson">Davey Johnson</a> and <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a> with younger stars <a href="Bobby%20Grich">Bobby Grich</a> and <a href="Doug%20DeCinces">Doug DeCinces</a>, respectively. Johnson would be dealt along with <a href="Johnny%20Oates">Johnny Oates</a> to the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> for catcher and 1971 <a href="National%20League%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">National League Rookie of the Year</a> <a href="Earl%20Williams%20%281970s%20catcher%29">Earl Williams</a>. Although Williams had hit 63 home runs in two seasons with Atlanta, he would only hit 36 homers in two seasons with the Orioles.

In 1975, the Birds acquired slugger <a href="Lee%20May">Lee May</a> in a trade with Houston, and traded <a href="Dave%20McNally">Dave McNally</a>, <a href="Rich%20Coggins">Rich Coggins</a> and minor-league pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal</a> for star outfielder <a href="Ken%20Singleton">Ken Singleton</a>, and future 20-game winner <a href="Mike%20Torrez">Mike Torrez</a>. Jim Palmer won the Cy Young Award, but the <a href="1975%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> lost the division title to the <a href="1975%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a> and their mega-rookies <a href="Fred%20Lynn">Fred Lynn</a> and <a href="Jim%20Rice">Jim Rice</a>. The 1976 season brought <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a> and <a href="Ken%20Holtzman">Ken Holtzman</a> from a trade with Oakland, but the <a href="1976%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> only won 88 games. It was this season when the Orioles made a trade that brought them players such as <a href="Tippy%20Martinez">Tippy Martinez</a> and <a href="Rick%20Dempsey">Rick Dempsey</a>. This young foundation, along with the departures of the unhappy Jackson and Holtzman, would create the basis for 1977. The <a href="1977%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">"No Name Orioles"</a>, along with Rookie of the Year <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a>, won 97 games and finished tied for second place with <a href="1977%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston</a>. After finishing fourth in 1978, the <a href="1979%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> finally won the division in 1979 thanks to strong play from Ken Singleton and Cy Young winner <a href="Mike%20Flanagan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Flanagan</a>. The Orioles defeated the <a href="1979%20California%20Angels%20season">Angels</a> in the <a href="1979%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, but lost to <a href="1979%20Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20season">Pittsburgh</a> in another <a href="1979%20World%20Series">stunning World Series</a>. This started a short period of heartbreak for Baltimore that would nevertheless culminate in a championship.

The <a href="1980%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> won 100 games in 1980 thanks to Cy Young winner <a href="Steve%20Stone%20%28baseball%29">Steve Stone</a>, but the <a href="1980%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> won 103 games. Although <a href="1981%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Baltimore</a> had the best overall record in the AL East in 1981, they finished second in each half. As a result, they were out of the playoffs due to the postseason structure that year because of the <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike</a>. The 1982 campaign saw Baltimore eliminated on the final weekend of the season by the <a href="1982%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. In an unforgettable scene, despite the season-ending loss eliminating them from the playoffs, fans stayed to honor the retiring <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a>, who would be succeeded by <a href="Joe%20Altobelli">Joe Altobelli</a>. In 1983, Altobelli would lead the Orioles to 98 wins and a division title thanks to MVP <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a>. The <a href="1983%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> defeated the <a href="1983%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> in the <a href="1983%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> thanks to a 10th-inning homer by <a href="Tito%20Landrum">Tito Landrum</a> in the deciding game. The Orioles won the <a href="1983%20World%20Series">World Series</a> in five games by defeating the <a href="1983%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a>.

During their most productive years and only World Series championships thus far, the Orioles saw three of its players named MVP: Frank Robinson in 1966; Boog Powell in 1970; and Cal Ripken, Jr. in 1983. Additionally, Brooks Robinson was named Most Valuable Player in 1964, just two years before the 1966–1983 golden era began. The pitching staff was phenomenal, with four pitchers winning six <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>s (Mike Cuellar in 1969; Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976; Mike Flanagan in 1979; and Steve Stone in 1980). In 1971, the team's four starting pitchers, McNally, Cuellar, Palmer, and Pat Dobson, all won 20 games, a feat that has not been replicated. In that year, the Birds went on to post a 101–61 record for their third-straight AL East title. Also during this stretch three players were named <a href="American%20League%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">rookies of the year</a>: <a href="Al%20Bumbry">Al Bumbry</a> (1973); Eddie Murray (1977); and Cal Ripken, Jr. (1982). One might date the glory years of the Orioles dating back to 1964, which would include two third-place seasons, 1964–65, in which the Orioles won 97 and 94 games, respectively, and a year in which third-baseman Brooks Robinson won his <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a> (1964). The glory years of the Orioles effectively ended when the <a href="1984%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a>, a divisional rival at the time, went 35–5 to open the 1984 season on the way to winning the World Series, in which Hall-of-Fame pitcher Jim Palmer retired during the 1984 season.

After winning the <a href="1983%20World%20Series">1983 World Series</a>, the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing 1986 in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore. The <a href="1988%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">team</a> hit bottom in 1988 when it started the season 0–21, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the majors that year. The "Why Not?" Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the <a href="1989%20Toronto%20Blue%20Jays%20season">Toronto Blue Jays</a> overtook them and seized the AL East title on the final weekend of the regular season. The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken, Jr. winning his second <a href="AL%20MVP%20Award">AL MVP Award</a> in 1991. The <a href="1991%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> said goodbye to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38 years, at the end of the 1991 campaign.

Opening to much fanfare in 1992, <a href="Oriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a> was an instant success, spawning other retro-designed major league ballparks within the next two decades. The stadium became the site of the <a href="1993%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1993 All-Star Game</a>. The Orioles returned to contention in those first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times.

Also in 1993, with then-owner <a href="Eli%20Jacobs">Eli Jacobs</a> forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based attorney <a href="Peter%20Angelos">Peter Angelos</a>, along with the ownership syndicate he headed, was awarded the Orioles in <a href="United%20States%20bankruptcy%20court">bankruptcy court</a> in New York City, returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979.

After the 1993 season, the Orioles acquired first baseman <a href="Rafael%20Palmeiro">Rafael Palmeiro</a> from the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>. The Orioles, who spent all of 1994 chasing the <a href="1994%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a>, occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">players strike</a>, which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season.

The labor impasse would continue into the spring of 1995. Almost all of the major league clubs held spring training using <a href="strikebreaker">replacement players</a>, with the intention of beginning the <a href="1995%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a> with them. The Orioles, whose owner was a labor union lawyer, were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season. Had they fielded a substitute team, <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a>'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized. The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled.

The Ripken countdown resumed once the season began. Ripken finally broke <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>'s consecutive games streak of 2,130 games in a nationally televised game on September 6. This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999. Ripken finished his streak with 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998, the <a href="1998%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> final home game of the season against the <a href="1998%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> at Camden Yards.

The Orioles finished two games under .500 (71–73) in third place in <a href="Phil%20Regan%20%28baseball%29">Phil Regan</a>'s only season of managing the ballclub.

Before the 1996 season, Angelos hired <a href="Pat%20Gillick">Pat Gillick</a> as general manager. Given the green light to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like <a href="B.J.%20Surhoff">B.J. Surhoff</a>, <a href="Randy%20Myers">Randy Myers</a>, <a href="David%20Wells">David Wells</a> and <a href="Roberto%20Alomar">Roberto Alomar</a>. Under new manager <a href="Davey%20Johnson">Davey Johnson</a> and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 home runs in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a 12-year absence by clinching the AL wild card berth. Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into home plate umpire <a href="John%20Hirschbeck">John Hirschbeck</a>'s face during an argument in Toronto. He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason. After dethroning the defending American League champion <a href="1996%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Cleveland Indians</a> 3–1 in the <a href="1996%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">Division Series</a>, the Orioles fell to the <a href="1996%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> 4–1 in an <a href="1996%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a> notable for right field umpire <a href="Rich%20Garcia">Rich Garcia</a>'s failure to call fan interference in the first game of the series, when 12-year-old Yankee fan <a href="Jeffrey%20Maier">Jeffrey Maier</a> reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play ball, which was scored as a home run for <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a>, tying the game at 4–4 in the eighth inning. Absent Maier's interference, it appeared as if the ball might have been off the wall or caught by right fielder <a href="Tony%20Tarasco">Tony Tarasco</a>. The Yankees went on to win the game in extra innings on an ensuing walk-off home run by Bernie Williams.

The Orioles went "wire-to-wire" (first place from start to finish) in winning the AL East title in 1997. After eliminating the <a href="1997%20Seattle%20Mariners%20season">Seattle Mariners</a> 3–1 in the <a href="1997%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">Division Series</a>, the team lost again in the <a href="1997%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, this time to the underdog <a href="1997%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">Indians</a> 4–2, with each Oriole loss by only a run. Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's fine for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's charity. Pitching coach <a href="Ray%20Miller%20%28baseball%20manager%29">Ray Miller</a> replaced Johnson.

With Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season. When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed. Angelos brought in <a href="Frank%20Wren">Frank Wren</a> to take over as GM. The Orioles added volatile slugger <a href="Albert%20Belle">Albert Belle</a>, but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like <a href="Rafael%20Palmeiro">Rafael Palmeiro</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Alomar">Roberto Alomar</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Davis%20%28baseball%29">Eric Davis</a> leaving in free agency. After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren. He named <a href="Syd%20Thrift">Syd Thrift</a> the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager <a href="Mike%20Hargrove">Mike Hargrove</a>.

In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an <a href="1999%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20%E2%80%93%20Cuban%20national%20baseball%20team%20exhibition%20series">exhibition series</a> against the <a href="Cuba%20national%20baseball%20team">Cuban national team</a> in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>. The Orioles won the game 3–2 in 11 innings. They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the <a href="1959%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> faced the <a href="1959%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> in an exhibition. The Cuban team visited Baltimore in May 1999. Cuba won the second game 10–6.

Cal Ripken, Jr. achieved his 3000th hit early in the season. A fire sale occurred late in the season, where the Orioles traded away many veterans for unproven young players and minor league prospects. The Orioles called up many of their AAA players to finish the season. The only acquired player that would have a long-term career with the organization was <a href="Melvin%20Mora">Melvin Mora</a>.
This was Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final season. His number (8) was retired in a ceremony before the final home game of the season.

In an effort to right the Orioles' sinking ship, changes began to sweep through the organization in 2003. General manager <a href="Syd%20Thrift">Syd Thrift</a> was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired <a href="Jim%20Beattie%20%28baseball%29">Jim Beattie</a> as executive vice-president and <a href="Mike%20Flanagan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Flanagan</a> as the vice president of baseball operations. After another losing season, manager <a href="Mike%20Hargrove">Mike Hargrove</a> was not retained and Yankees coach <a href="Lee%20Mazzilli">Lee Mazzilli</a> was brought in as the new manager. The team signed powerful hitters in SS <a href="Miguel%20Tejada">Miguel Tejada</a>, C <a href="Javy%20L%C3%B3pez">Javy López</a>, and former Oriole 1B <a href="Rafael%20Palmeiro">Rafael Palmeiro</a>. The following season, the Orioles traded for OF <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a>.

The team got hot early in 2005 and jumped out in front of the AL East division, holding onto first place for 62 straight days. However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the Orioles started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging <a href="2005%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> and <a href="2005%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Red Sox</a>. Injuries to Lopez, Sosa, <a href="Luis%20Matos">Luis Matos</a>, <a href="Brian%20Roberts">Brian Roberts</a>, and <a href="Larry%20Bigbie">Larry Bigbie</a> came within weeks of each other, and the team grew increasingly dissatisfied with the "band-aid" moves of the front office and manager Mazzilli to help them through this period of struggle. Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick OF <a href="Jeff%20Fiorentino">Jeff Fiorentino</a> were brought up in place of more experienced players such as OF <a href="David%20Newhan">David Newhan</a>, who had batted .311 the previous season.

After starting the season 42–28 (.600), the Orioles finished the season with a stretch of 32–60 (.348), ending at 74–88 (.457). Only the <a href="2005%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a> (.346) had a worse winning percentage for the season than did the Orioles for the final 92 games. The club's major off-season acquisition, <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a>, posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average. The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him. The Orioles also allowed Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him. On August 25, pitcher <a href="Sidney%20Ponson">Sidney Ponson</a> was arrested for DUI, and on September 1, the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and released him. The <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Association</a> filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration and was eventually resolved.

In the <a href="2006%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">2006 World Baseball Classic</a>, the Orioles contributed more players than any other major league team, with eleven players suiting up for their home nations. <a href="%C3%89rik%20B%C3%A9dard">Érik Bédard</a> and <a href="Adam%20Loewen">Adam Loewen</a> pitched for <a href="Canada%20national%20baseball%20team">Canada</a>; <a href="Rodrigo%20L%C3%B3pez%20%28baseball%29">Rodrigo López</a> and <a href="Ger%C3%B3nimo%20Gil">Gerónimo Gil</a> (released before the season began by the club) played for <a href="Mexico%20national%20baseball%20team">Mexico</a>; <a href="Daniel%20Cabrera">Daniel Cabrera</a> and <a href="Miguel%20Tejada">Miguel Tejada</a> for the <a href="Dominican%20Republic%20national%20baseball%20team">Dominican Republic</a>; <a href="Javy%20L%C3%B3pez">Javy López</a> and <a href="Luis%20Matos">Luis Matos</a> for <a href="Puerto%20Rico%20national%20baseball%20team">Puerto Rico</a>; <a href="Bruce%20Chen">Bruce Chen</a> for <a href="Panama%20national%20baseball%20team">Panama</a>; <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Ramón Hernández</a> for <a href="Venezuela%20national%20baseball%20team">Venezuela</a>; and <a href="John%20Stephens%20%28baseball%29">John Stephens</a> for <a href="Australia%20national%20baseball%20team">Australia</a>. The Orioles finished the 2006 season with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses, 27 games behind the AL East-leading <a href="2006%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a>.

On June 18, the Orioles fired <a href="Sam%20Perlozzo">Sam Perlozzo</a> after losing eight straight games. He was replaced on interim basis by <a href="Dave%20Trembley">Dave Trembley</a>. On June 22, Miguel Tejada's consecutive-games streak came to an end due to an injury, the fifth-longest streak in major league history. <a href="Aubrey%20Huff">Aubrey Huff</a> became the first Oriole to hit for the cycle at home, on June 29 against the Angels. On July 7, <a href="%C3%89rik%20B%C3%A9dard">Érik Bédard</a> struck out 15 batters in a game against the <a href="2007%20Texas%20Rangers%20season">Texas Rangers</a> to tie a franchise record held by <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a>. On July 31, 2007, <a href="Andy%20MacPhail">Andy MacPhail</a> named Dave Trembley as the Orioles manager through the remainder of the 2007 season, and advised him to "Keep up the good work." Facing the <a href="2007%20Texas%20Rangers%20season">Texas Rangers</a> in a doubleheader at Camden Yards on August 22, the Orioles surrendered 30 runs in the first game, a modern-era record for a single game, in a 30–3 defeat. The Orioles led the game 3–0 after three innings of play. Sixteen of Texas' thirty runs were scored in the final two innings. The Orioles would also fall in the nightcap, 9–7.

The Orioles began the 2008 season in a rebuilding mode under President of Baseball Operations <a href="Andy%20MacPhail">Andy MacPhail</a>. The Orioles traded away star players <a href="Miguel%20Tejada">Miguel Tejada</a> to the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Astros</a> and ace <a href="%C3%89rik%20B%C3%A9dard">Érik Bédard</a> to the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a> for prized prospect <a href="Adam%20Jones%20%28baseball%29">Adam Jones</a>, lefty reliever <a href="George%20Sherrill">George Sherrill</a>, and minor league pitchers <a href="Kam%20Mickolio">Kam Mickolio</a>, <a href="Chris%20Tillman">Chris Tillman</a>, and Tony Butler. The Orioles started off the first couple weeks of the season near the top of their division as players such as <a href="Nick%20Markakis">Nick Markakis</a> and newcomer <a href="Luke%20Scott">Luke Scott</a> led the team offensively. Although the Orioles hovered around .500 for much of the season, they had fallen back by September and were over 20 games behind the first place <a href="2008%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. They finished the season losing 11 of their final 12 games and 28 of their final 34. The team finished last for the first time since their 1988 season.

After the season ended, the Orioles showcased altered uniforms, with a circular 'Maryland' patch added to the left-hand sleeve of all jerseys and the grey road jerseys displaying "Baltimore" across the chest for the first time in a quarter-century; this reflected the arrival of the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a>, because ever since the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281961%E2%80%9371%29">Washington Senators</a> had departed for Texas in 1972, the Orioles had claimed to represent the Baltimore-Washington metro area.

On June 30, the Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against <a href="2009%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a> after facing a 10–1 deficit in the 7th inning, winning the game by 11–10, setting a Major League Baseball record for the largest comeback by a last-place team over a first-place team. However, the team finished the 2009 season with 64 wins and 98 losses, making it the worst record in the 2009 American League season. Despite this, Manager <a href="Dave%20Trembley">Dave Trembley</a> was re-hired for the 2010 season. Centerfielder Adam Jones was named to the <a href="2009%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2009 All Star team</a> and awarded a Gold Glove award for his defensive play.

On April 12, the team set a club record for the lowest paid attendance in Camden Yards history, only 9,129 attended the game versus the <a href="2010%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Rays</a>. The Orioles then went 2–16 to begin the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">season</a>, one of the worst openings in MLB history. For much of the first half of the season, they had the worst record in the league.

On June 4, with an 8 game losing streak and the worst record in the league at 15-39, the Orioles replaced <a href="Dave%20Trembley">Dave Trembley</a> as manager with third base coach <a href="Juan%20Samuel">Juan Samuel</a> as interim manager. They did well at first, but then they started losing again. The Orioles hired <a href="Buck%20Showalter">Buck Showalter</a> on July 29 to be the full-time manager. He was introduced on August 2 and made his debut on August 3, after the Orioles fired Samuel. Showalter's arrival produced, or coincided with, a turnaround; the Birds went 34–24 in August, September and October.

On February 4, 2011, the Orioles signed free agent <a href="Vladimir%20Guerrero">Vladimir Guerrero</a> to be the team's designated hitter. Playing for the Texas Rangers during the 2010 season, Guerrero had hit 29 home runs, with a .300 batting average. (His career batting average was .320 with 436 home runs.)

The Orioles 2011 record was 69–93, the 14th consecutive losing season for the franchise dating back to 1998. The highlight of the season was their final game on September 28, when they defeated the <a href="2011%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a> 4–3 thanks to 9th inning heroics by <a href="Nolan%20Reimold">Nolan Reimold</a> and <a href="Robert%20Andino">Robert Andino</a>. The Orioles victory prevented the Red Sox from earning the wild card berth as part of "<a href="Game%20162">Game 162</a>", one of the most dramatic nights in Major League Baseball history. On November 8, the Orioles announced the hiring of <a href="Dan%20Duquette">Dan Duquette</a> as the vice president of baseball operations (de facto GM) in the hopes of turning the corner.

The Orioles finished the first half of the 2012 season with a winning record for only the second time since going wire to wire in 1997, with a record of 45–40 before the All-Star break. On May 6, the Orioles played a 17-inning game against the <a href="2012%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a>, the first game since 1925 in which both teams used a position player as a pitcher. The Orioles won that game, and designated hitter <a href="Chris%20Davis%20%28baseball%29">Chris Davis</a> received the win. The Orioles won their 81st game on September 13, ending the streak of 14 straight years with a losing record, as well as ensuring that the team would spend the entire year with a record of .500 or higher. On September 16, they won their 82nd game, securing the first season with a winning record since 1997.

On September 21, closer <a href="Jim%20Johnson%20%28right-handed%20pitcher%29">Jim Johnson</a> earned his 46th save of the season, setting a new Orioles franchise record for saves by one pitcher in a single season. It was previously held by <a href="Randy%20Myers">Randy Myers</a>, who had 45 saves in 1997. Johnson became the tenth player to record 50 saves in Major League history. He finished the regular season with 51 saves.

With the win against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> on September 30 and the loss of the <a href="2012%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Los Angeles Angels</a> to the <a href="2012%20Texas%20Rangers%20season">Texas Rangers</a> in the second game of a double header, the Orioles clinched a playoff berth. This season marked the Orioles return to postseason play.

The Orioles finished the regular season in second place in the AL East with a record of 93–69, reversing the 69–93 record from the previous year. Despite a poor run differential (+7, the lowest of all playoff teams in 2012), they benefited from a 29–9 record in games decided by one run and a 16–2 record in extra-inning games. They went on the road to face the team that finished first in the Wild Card race, the Texas Rangers for a <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Wild%20Card%20Game">one-game playoff series</a> on October 5, winning 5–1 to advance to the <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> against the <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">New York Yankees</a> on October 7.

The season was also distinctive for the fact that Orioles became the only team in MLB history, since 1900, never to have lost a game due to an opponent's walk-off hit. Despite a regular season of avoiding walk-off losses, they lost in Game 3 of the ALDS when Yankee <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Iba%C3%B1ez">Raúl Ibañez</a> hit his own record-setting, game-winning home run in the bottom of the 12th inning. The Orioles would lose the 2012 <a href="American%20League%20Division%20Series">American League Division Series</a> in five games.

During the home opener on April 5, first baseman <a href="Chris%20Davis%20%28baseball%29">Chris Davis</a> set a new MLB record with 16 RBI's during the first four games of a season, as well as becoming the fourth player ever to hit home runs in the first four games, including a grand slam in the fourth. On September 13, Davis hit his 50th home run of the season, against the <a href="2013%20Toronto%20Blue%20Jays%20season">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, tying <a href="Brady%20Anderson">Brady Anderson</a> for the most home runs in Orioles history. Davis would break Anderson's record four days later against the <a href="2013%20Boston%20Red%20Sox%20season">Boston Red Sox</a>. His 51st home run also tied Anderson's record of 92 extra-base hits in a single season, a record he would again break four days later. Davis would go on to finish the season with 53 home runs.

On September 18, the Orioles played their 114th errorless game of the season, setting a new MLB record for the most errorless games in one season since 1900. They played 119 games without an error, ending on September 27.

On September 20, the Orioles played the <a href="2013%20Tampa%20Bay%20Rays%20season">Tampa Bay Rays</a> in an 18 inning game that lasted 6 hours, 54 minutes, a new record for the longest game in terms of time for both franchises, as well as innings for the Rays. The Rays won 5–4.

While the Orioles would ultimately miss the playoffs in 2013, they finished with a record of 85–77, tying the <a href="2013%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">Yankees</a> for third place in the AL East. By posting winning records in 2012 and 2013, the Orioles achieved the feat of back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1996 and 1997.

On September 16, the Orioles clinched the division for the first time since 1997 with a win against the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> as well as making it back to the postseason for the second time in three years. The Orioles finished the 2014 season with a 96–66 record and went on to sweep the Detroit Tigers in the <a href="2014%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>. Notably, the three Tigers starters were winners of the previous 3 AL <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>s; <a href="Max%20Scherzer">Max Scherzer</a> (2013), <a href="Justin%20Verlander">Justin Verlander</a> (2011), and <a href="David%20Price%20%28baseball%29">David Price</a> (2012). The O's were then in turn swept by the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a> in the <a href="2014%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>.

On April 26, the Orioles scored 18 runs against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, the most runs they had scored in a single game, since they defeated the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> 18–9 on April 19, 2006. The Orioles beat the Red Sox 18–7. On June 16, the Orioles scored 19 runs against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>, making it the most runs the Orioles have scored since earlier in the season against the Red Sox. The Orioles had 8 home runs during the game, a franchise record. The team then later got their 5000th win as the Orioles on June 28 with a shutout 4–0 win over the Indians. On August 16, the Orioles defeated the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> 18–2, during which the team tied a franchise record for hits in a single game with 26. On September 11, the Orioles rallied from a two run deficit of 6–4 in the bottom of the 8th inning, against the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>. The Orioles won the game 14–8. The rally included left fielder <a href="Nolan%20Reimold">Nolan Reimold</a> and designated hitter <a href="Steve%20Clevenger">Steve Clevenger</a> both hitting their first career grand slams, making the Orioles the only franchise in the history of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> to hit multiple grand slams in the same inning in two different games, the last time being in 1986. On September 30, in a reverse of fortune, the Toronto Blue Jays clinched the AL East with a win over the Orioles in Baltimore where they watched the Orioles celebrate their division title clinch the previous year.

Out of an abundance of caution, the Baltimore Orioles announced the postponement of the April 27 and 28 games against the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> following <a href="2015%20Baltimore%20riots">violent riots</a> in West Baltimore following the <a href="death%20of%20Freddie%20Gray">death of Freddie Gray</a>. Following the announcement of the second postponement, the Orioles also announced that the third game in the series scheduled for Wednesday, April 29 was to be closed to the public and would be televised only, apparently the first time in 145 years of Major League Baseball that a game had no spectators and breaking the previous 131-year-old record for lowest paid attendance to an official game (the previous record being 6.) The Orioles beat the White Sox, 8–2. The Orioles said the make-up games would be played Thursday, May 28, as a double-header. In addition, the weekend games against the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a> was moved to <a href="Tropicana%20Field">the Rays' home stadium</a> in <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg</a> where Baltimore played as the home team.

The Orioles' home uniform is white with the word "Orioles" written across the chest. The road uniform is gray with the word "Baltimore" written across the chest. A long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the "away" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of <a href="Edward%20Bennett%20Williams">Edward Bennett Williams</a> when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation's capital region after the moving of the former <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281961%E2%80%9371%29">Washington Senators</a> in 1971. After several decades, approximately 20% of the team's attendance came from the metro Washington area. An alternate uniform is black with the word "Orioles" written across the chest. The Orioles wear their black alternate jerseys for Friday night games with the alternate "O's" cap, whether at home or on the road; the cartoon bird batting helmet is still used with this uniform (see description on home and road design).

For 2012, the team unveiled its new uniforms. There was a change to the cap insignia, with the cartoon Oriole returning. Home caps are white in front and black at the back with an orange bill, while the road caps are all black on top with an orange bill. The Orioles also introduced a new alternate orange uniform to be worn on Saturday home games throughout the 2012 season.

In 2013, ESPN ran a "Battle of the Uniforms" contest between all 30 Major League clubs. Despite using a ranking system that had the Orioles as a #13 seed, the Birds beat the #1 seed Cardinals in the championship round.

On June 27, 2014, the Orioles announced since their win in New York against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> they will wear their 'new orange' jerseys every Saturday for the rest of the <a href="2014%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">2014 season</a> both home and away. They have since continued to wear the orange jerseys on most Saturday road games.

For 2017, the Orioles began to use their batting practice caps for select games with the black uniforms. The aforementioned caps resemble their regular road caps save for the black bill.

In Baltimore, Orioles games on radio can be heard over <a href="WJZ-FM">WJZ-FM</a> (105.7 FM). <a href="Fred%20Manfra">Fred Manfra</a> and <a href="Joe%20Angel">Joe Angel</a> alternate as <a href="play-by-play">play-by-play</a> announcers. WJZ-FM also feeds the games to a <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20Radio%20Network">network</a> of 36 stations, covering Washington, D.C. and all or portions of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, and <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>.

WJZ-FM is in its second stint as the Orioles' flagship radio outlet; the station had carried the team previously from 2007 through 2010. Previous radio flagships for the Orioles have been <a href="WCBM">WCBM</a> (680 AM) from 1954 to 1956, and again for the 1987 season; <a href="WBAL%20%28AM%29">WBAL</a> (1090 AM) over three separate stints (1957 to 1978, 1988 to 2006, and 2011 to 2014); and WFBR (1300 AM, now <a href="WJZ%20%28AM%29">WJZ</a>) from 1979 through 1986.

The <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Sports%20Network">Mid-Atlantic Sports Network</a> (MASN), co-owned by the Orioles and the Washington Nationals, is the team's exclusive television broadcaster. MASN airs almost the entire slate of regular season games. Some exceptions include <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20Fox">Saturday games</a> on either <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> (via its Baltimore affiliate, <a href="WBFF">WBFF</a>) or <a href="Fox%20Sports%201">Fox Sports 1</a>, or "<a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20ESPN">Sunday Night Baseball</a>" on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>. Many MASN telecasts in conflict with Nationals' game telecasts air on an alternate MASN2 feed. MASN also produces an over-the-air package of games for broadcast locally by <a href="CBS">CBS</a>–owned <a href="WJZ-TV">WJZ-TV</a> (channel 13); these broadcasts are branded as "MASN on WJZ 13". Veteran sportscaster <a href="Gary%20Thorne">Gary Thorne</a> is the current lead television announcer, with <a href="Jim%20Hunter%20%28sportscaster%29">Jim Hunter</a> as his backup along with Hall of Fame member and former Orioles pitcher <a href="Jim%20Palmer">Jim Palmer</a> and former Oriole infielder <a href="Mike%20Bordick">Mike Bordick</a> as color analysts, who almost always work separately. All telecasts on MASN and WJZ-TV are shown in <a href="High-definition%20television">high-definition</a>.

As part of the settlement of a television broadcast rights dispute with <a href="Comcast%20SportsNet%20Mid-Atlantic">Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic</a>, the Orioles severed their Comcast ties at the end of the 2006 season. Comcast SportsNet had been the Orioles' cable partner since 1984, when it was Home Team Sports.

WJZ-TV has been the Orioles' broadcast TV home since 1994. The station has previously carried the team from their arrival in Baltimore in 1954 through 1978; in the first four seasons, WJZ-TV shared coverage with Baltimore's other two stations, <a href="WMAR-TV">WMAR-TV</a> and <a href="WBAL-TV">WBAL-TV</a>. The games moved to WMAR from 1979 through 1993 before returning to WJZ-TV. From 1994 to 2009, some Orioles games aired on <a href="WNUV">WNUV</a>.

Six former Oriole franchise radio announcers have received the Hall of Fame's <a href="Ford%20C.%20Frick%20Award">Ford C.

In 1991, the Orioles experimented with longtime TV writer/producer <a href="Ken%20Levine%20%28TV%20personality%29">Ken Levine</a> as a play-by-play broadcaster. Levine was best noted for his work on TV shows such as "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" and "<a href="M%2AA%2AS%2AH%20%28TV%20series%29">M*A*S*H</a>", but only lasted one season in the Orioles broadcast booth.

Since its introduction at games by the "Roar from 34", led by <a href="Wild%20Bill%20Hagy">Wild Bill Hagy</a> and others, in the late 1970s, it has been a tradition at Orioles games for fans to yell out the "Oh" in the line "Oh, say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave" in "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>". "The Star-Spangled Banner" has special meaning to Baltimore historically, as it was written during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baltimore">Battle of Baltimore</a> in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> by <a href="Francis%20Scott%20Key">Francis Scott Key</a>, a Baltimorean. "O" is not only short for "Oriole", but the vowel is also a stand-out aspect of the <a href="Baltimorese">Baltimorean accent</a>.

The tradition is often carried out at other sporting events, both professional or amateur, and even sometimes at non-sporting events where the anthem is played, throughout the <a href="Baltimore%E2%80%93Washington%20metropolitan%20area">Baltimore/Washington area</a> and beyond. Fans in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, chanted "O!" even before the <a href="Norfolk%20Tides">Tides</a> became an Orioles affiliate. The practice caught some attention in the spring of 2005, when fans performed the "O!" cry at <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> games at <a href="RFK%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a>. The "O!" chant is also common at sporting events for the various <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins">Maryland Terrapins</a> teams at the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland, College Park</a>. At <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a>'s induction into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, the crowd, comprising mostly Orioles fans, carried out the "O!" tradition during <a href="Tony%20Gwynn">Tony Gwynn</a>'s daughter's rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Additionally, a faint but audible "O!" could be heard on the television broadcast of Barack Obama's pre-inaugural visit to Baltimore as the National Anthem played before his entrance. A resounding "O!" bellowed from the nearly 30,000 Ravens fans that attended the November 21, 2010, away game at the <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>' <a href="Bank%20of%20America%20Stadium">Bank of America Stadium</a> in Charlotte, North Carolina. A similar loud "O!" was heard from fans attending <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII">Super Bowl XLVII</a> between the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> and the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a>. The "O!" chant was also heard during the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, when Baltimore native <a href="Michael%20Phelps">Michael Phelps</a> received one of his gold medals on <a href="August%209">August 9</a>, 2016.

In recent years, when the Orioles host the <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, fans have begun to shout out the multiple instances of the word "O" in ""<a href="O%20Canada">O Canada</a>"". <a href="Washington%20Capitals">Washington Capitals</a> fans will do the same when they play one of the NHL's Canadian teams.

It has been an Orioles tradition since 1975 to play <a href="John%20Denver">John Denver</a>'s "<a href="Thank%20God%20I%27m%20a%20Country%20Boy">Thank God I'm a Country Boy</a>" during the <a href="seventh-inning%20stretch">seventh-inning stretch</a>.

In the edition of July 5, 2007 of Baltimore's weekly sports publication "Press Box", an article by Mike Gibbons covered the details of how this tradition came to be. During "Thank God I'm a Country Boy", Charlie Zill, then an usher, would put on overalls, a straw hat, and false teeth and dance around the club level section (244) that he tended to. He also has an orange violin that spins for the fiddle solos. He went by the name Zillbilly and had done the skit from the 1999 season until shortly before he died in early 2013. During a nationally televised game on September 20, 1997, Denver himself danced to the song atop the Orioles' dugout, one of his final public appearances before dying in a plane crash three weeks later.

Songs from notable games in the team's history include "<a href="One%20Moment%20in%20Time">One Moment in Time</a>" for Cal Ripken's record-breaking game in 1995, as well as the theme from "<a href="Pearl%20Harbor%20%28film%29">Pearl Harbor</a>", "There You'll Be" by <a href="Faith%20Hill">Faith Hill</a>, during his final game in 2001. The theme from "<a href="Field%20of%20Dreams">Field of Dreams</a>" was played at the last game at Memorial Stadium in 1991, and the song "Magic to Do" from the stage musical "<a href="Pippin%20%28musical%29">Pippin</a>" was used that season to commemorate "Orioles Magic" on 33rd Street. During the Orioles' heyday in the 1970s, a club song, appropriately titled "Orioles Magic (Feel It Happen)", was composed by Walt Woodward, and played when the team ran out until Opening Day of 2008. Since then, the song (a favorite among all fans, who appreciated its references to <a href="Wild%20Bill%20Hagy">Wild Bill Hagy</a> and <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a>) is only played (along with a video featuring several Orioles stars performing the song) after wins. <a href="Seven%20Nation%20Army">Seven Nation Army</a> is played as a hype song while the fans chant the signature bass riff as a rally cry during key moments of a game or after a walk-off hit.

During the Orioles' final homestand of the season, it is a tradition to display a replica of the 15-star, 15-stripe <a href="American%20flag">American flag</a> at Camden Yards. Prior to 1992, the 15-star, 15-stripe flag flew from Memorial Stadium's center-field flagpole in place of the 50-star, 13-stripe flag during the final homestand. Since the move to Camden Yards, the former flag has been displayed on the batters' eye. During the Orioles' final home game of the season, <a href="The%20United%20States%20Army%20Field%20Band">The United States Army Field Band</a> from <a href="Fort%20Meade">Fort Meade</a> performs the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">National Anthem</a> prior to the start of the game. The Band has also played the National Anthem at the finales of three <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> in which the Orioles played in: <a href="1970%20World%20Series">1970</a>, <a href="1971%20World%20Series">1971</a> and <a href="1979%20World%20Series">1979</a>. They are introduced as the "First Army Band" during the pregame ceremonies.

For 23 years, <a href="Rex%20Barney">Rex Barney</a> was the <a href="Public%20address">PA announcer</a> for the Orioles. His voice became a fixture of both Memorial Stadium and Camden Yards, and his expression "Give that fan a contract", uttered whenever a fan caught a <a href="foul%20ball">foul ball</a>, was one of his trademarks – the other being his distinct "Thank Yooooou..." following every announcement. (He was also known on occasion to say "Give that fan an error" after a dropped foul ball.) Barney died on August 12, 1997, and in his honor that night's game at Camden Yards against the Oakland Athletics was held without a public–address announcer.

Barney was replaced as Camden Yards' PA announcer by Dave McGowan, who held the position until December 2011.

Lifelong Orioles fan and former <a href="MLB%20Fan%20Cave">MLB Fan Cave</a> resident Ryan Wagner is the current PA announcer. He was chosen out of a field of more than 670 applicants in the 2011–2012 offseason.

Of the eight original American League teams, the Orioles were the last of the eight to win the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a>, doing so in <a href="1966%20World%20Series">1966</a> with its four–game sweep of the heavily favored <a href="1966%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. When the Orioles were the St. Louis Browns, they played in only one World Series, the <a href="1944%20World%20Series">1944 matchup</a> against their Sportsman's Park tenants, the <a href="1944%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">Cardinals</a>. The Orioles won the first-ever <a href="American%20League%20Championship%20Series">American League Championship Series</a> in 1969, and in 2012 the Orioles beat the Texas Rangers in the inaugural American League <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20wild-card%20game">Wild Card game</a>, where for the first time two Wild Card teams faced each other during postseason play.

The Orioles will only retire a number when a player has been inducted into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Fame</a> with <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Jr.">Cal Ripken, Jr.</a> being the only exception. However, the Orioles have placed moratoriums on other former Orioles's numbers following their deaths (see note below). To date, the Orioles have retired the following numbers:

Note: <a href="Cal%20Ripken%2C%20Sr.">Cal Ripken, Sr.</a>'s number 7, <a href="Elrod%20Hendricks">Elrod Hendricks</a>' number 44, and <a href="Mike%20Flanagan%20%28baseball%29">Mike Flanagan</a>'s number 46 have not officially been retired, but a moratorium has been placed on them and they have not been issued by the team since their deaths.

"Jackie Robinson's number 42 is retired throughout Major League Baseball"

The Orioles also have an official team hall of fame, located on display on Eutaw Street at Camden Yards. The most recent inductees are <a href="John%20Lowenstein">John Lowenstein</a>, <a href="Gary%20Roenicke">Gary Roenicke</a>, and <a href="Melvin%20Mora">Melvin Mora</a>, who were inducted in 2015.




The Orioles have a burgeoning regional rivalry with the nearby <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a> nicknamed the <a href="Beltway%20Series">Beltway Series</a> or Battle of the Beltways. Baltimore currently leads the series with a 26–20 record over the Nationals.

Bastarnae

The Bastarnae (<a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> variants: "Bastarni", or "Basternae"; ) were an ancient people who between 200 BC and 300 AD inhabited the region between the <a href="Carpathian">Carpathian</a> mountains and the river <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a>, to the north and east of ancient <a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>. The Peucini, denoted a branch of the Bastarnae by Greco-Roman writers, occupied the region north of the <a href="Danube%20delta">Danube delta</a>.

The ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Bastarnae was probably <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a>, which is supported by ancient historians and modern archeology. However, some ancient literary sources imply <a href="Celtic%20peoples">Celtic</a> or <a href="Scytho-Sarmatian">Scytho-Sarmatian</a> influences. The most likely scenario is that they were originally a group of <a href="East%20Germanic">East Germanic</a> tribes, originally resident in the lower <a href="Vistula%20river">Vistula river</a> valley. In ca. 200 BC, these tribes then migrated, possibly accompanied by some Celtic elements, southeastwards into the North Pontic region. Some elements appear to have become assimilated, to some extent, by the surrounding <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> by the 3rd century.

Although largely sedentary, some elements may have adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle. It has not, so far, been possible to identify archaeological sites which can be conclusively attributed to the Bastarnae. The archaeological horizons most often associated by scholars with the Bastarnae are the <a href="Zarubintsy%20culture">Zarubintsy</a> and Poienesti-Lukashevka cultures.

The Bastarnae first came into conflict with the Romans during the 1st century BC, when, in alliance with <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> and Sarmatians, they unsuccessfully resisted Roman expansion into <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> and <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>. Later, they appear to have maintained friendly relations with the <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman empire</a> during the first two centuries AD. This changed from c. 180, when the Bastarnae are recorded as participants in an invasion of Roman territory, once again in alliance with Sarmatian and Dacian elements. In the mid-3rd century, the Bastarnae were part of a <a href="Goth">Goth</a>ic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the Balkan provinces of the Roman empire.

Large numbers of Bastarnae were resettled within the Roman empire in the late 3rd century.

The origin of the tribal name is uncertain. It is not even clear whether it was an exonym (a name ascribed to them by outsiders) or an endonym (a name by which the Bastarnae described themselves). A related question is whether the groups denoted "Bastarnae" by the Romans considered themselves a distinct ethnic group at all (endonym) or whether it was a generic exonym used by the Greco-Romans to denote a disparate group of tribes of the Carpathian region that could not be classified as Dacians or Sarmatians.

One possible derivation is from the <a href="proto-Germanic">proto-Germanic</a> word "*bastjan" (from <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> root *"bʰas-") means "binding" or "tie". In this case, "Bastarnae" may have had the original meaning of a coalition or "bund" of tribes.

It is possible that the Roman term "<a href="basterna">basterna</a>", denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, the name of the people is derived from it) which was known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon-train for their families.

It has also been suggested that the name is linked with the Germanic word "bastard", meaning illegitimate or mongrel. But Batty considers this derivation unlikely. If the name is an endonym, then this derivation is unlikely, as most endonyms have flattering meanings (e.g. "brave", "strong", "noble").

Trubačev proposes a derivation from <a href="Old%20Persian">Old Persian</a>, <a href="Avestan">Avestan</a> "bast-" "bound, tied; slave" (cf. <a href="Ossetic">Ossetic</a> bættən "bind", bast "bound") and <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian</a> "*arna-" "offspring", equating it with the "δουλόσποροι" "slave Sporoi" mentioned by <a href="Nonnus">Nonnus</a> and <a href="Cosmas%20of%20Maiuma">Cosmas</a>, where <a href="Sporoi">Sporoi</a> is the people <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> mentions as the ancestors of the <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>.

The original homeland of the Bastarnae remains uncertain. Babeş and Shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> on the <a href="Baltic%20sea">Baltic</a> coast of NW Poland, on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material e.g. a Pomeranian-style <a href="fibula%20%28brooch%29">fibula</a> found in a Poieneşti site in <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> (although Batty considers the evidence insufficient). Babeş identifies the Sidoni, a branch of the Bastarnae which <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> places north of the Danube delta with the "Sidini" located by Ptolemy in Pomerania.

Batty argues that Greco-Roman sources of the 1st century AD locate the Bastarnae homeland on the northern side of the <a href="Carpathians">Northern Carpathian</a> mountain range, encompassing S.E. <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and SW <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (i.e. the region traditionally known as <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>). Pliny locates the Bastarnae between the <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a> and the <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a> ("contermini Dacis"). The <a href="Peutinger%20Map">Peutinger Map</a> (produced in ca. 400 AD, but including material from as early as the 1st century) shows the Bastarnae (mis-spelt "Blastarni") north of the Carpathian mountains and appears to name the Galician Carpathians as the "Alpes Bastarnicae".

From Galicia, the Bastarnae expanded into modern-day <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> and <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a>, reaching the <a href="Danube%20delta">Danube delta</a>. Strabo describes the Bastarnae as inhabiting the territory "between the "Ister" (river Danube) and the "Borysthenes" (river Dnieper)". He identifies three sub-tribes of the Bastarnae: the Atmoni, Sidoni and Peucini. The latter derived their name from <a href="Peuce">Peuce</a>, a large island in the Danube delta, which they had colonised. The 2nd-century geographer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> states that the "Carpiani" or <a href="Carpi%20%28Dacian%20tribe%29">Carpi</a> (believed to have occupied <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>) separated the Peucini from the other Bastarnae "above Dacia" (i.e. north of Dacia).

It thus appears that the Bastarnae were settled in a vast arc stretching around the northern and eastern flanks of the Carpathians from SE Poland to the Danube delta. The larger group inhabited the northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians and the region between the <a href="Prut">Prut</a> and <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> rivers (Moldova Republic/Western Ukraine), while a separate group (the Peucini, Sidoni and Atmoni) dwelt in and north of the Danube delta region.

Scholars hold divergent theories about the ethnicity of the Bastarnae. The mainstream view, following what appears to be the most authoritative view among ancient scholars, is that they were <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a>. However others hold that they were mixed Celtic/Germanic, or mixed Germanic/Sarmatian. A fringe theory is that they were <a href="Proto-Slavic">Proto-Slavic</a>. Shchukin argues that ethnicity of the Bastarnae was unique and rather than trying to label the Bastanae as Celtic, Germanic or Sarmatian, it should be accepted that the "Basternae were the Basternae". Batty argues that assigning an "ethnicity" to the Bastarnae is meaningless, as in the context of the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> Pontic-Danubian region, with its multiple overlapping peoples and languages, ethnicity was a very fluid concept: it could and did change rapidly and frequently, according to socio-political vicissitudes. This was especially true of the Bastarnae, who are attested over a relatively vast area.

Greco-Roman geographers of the 1st century AD are unanimous and specific that the Bastarnae were <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> in language and culture. The Greek geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> (writing c. AD 5-20) says the Bastarnae are "of Germanic stock". The Roman geographer <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (c. AD 77), classifies the Bastarnae and Peucini as constituting one of the 5 main subdivisions of Germanic peoples (he lists the other subdivisions as the "Inguaeones", "Istuaeones" and "Hermiones" (<a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic</a> tribes), and the "Vandili" (<a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="East%20Germanic">East Germanic</a>, but he classifies differently than the Bastarnae).

The Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> (c. AD 100) describes the Bastaenae as Germans with substantial Sarmatian influence, but moves on to state: "The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like the Germans in their language, way of life and types of dwelling."

A leading reason to consider the Bastarnae as Celtic is that the regions they are documented to have occupied (northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians) overlapped to a great extent with the locations of Celtic tribes attested in the northern Carpathians. Indeed, a large part of this region, <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, may derive its name from its former Celtic inhabitants the <a href="Taurisci">Taurisci</a>, <a href="Osi%20%28ancient%20tribe%29">Osi</a>, <a href="Cotini">Cotini</a> and <a href="Anartes">Anartes</a> of Slovakia and northern Romania and the <a href="Britogalli">Britogalli</a> of the Danubian Mouth region. In addition, archaeological cultures, which some scholars have linked to the Bastarnae (Poieneşti-Lukashevka asnd Zarubintsy), display pronounced Celtic influences. Finally, the arrival of the Bastarnae in the Pontic-Danubian region, which can be dated to 233-216 BC according to two ancient sources, coincides with the latter phase of Celtic migration into the region (400-200 BC).

The Roman historian <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, writing in c. AD 10, appears to imply that the Bastarnae were of Celtic speech. Relating the Bastarnic invasion of the Balkans of 179 BC (see <a href="Bastarnae%23Conflict%20with%20Rome">Conflict with Rome</a> below), he describes them then as "similar in language and customs" to the <a href="Scordisci">Scordisci</a>, a tribe of <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>, whose onomastics and material culture have been identified as Celtic by several scholars. The Scordisci are described as Celtic by <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> (although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians). However, a Celtic identity for the Bastarnae is apparently contradicted by <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> (writing ca. 150 BC), who was an actual contemporary of the events described, unlike Livy, who was writing some 200 years later. Polybius clearly distinguishes the Bastarnae from the "Galatae" (i.e. Celts): "an embassy from the <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a> arrived [at the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>], talking of the Bastarnae, their huge numbers, the strength and valour of their warriors, and also reporting that Perseus [king of Macedon] and the Galatae were in league with this tribe". In addition, inscription AE (1905) 14, recording a campaign on the <a href="Hungarian%20Plain">Hungarian Plain</a> by the Augustan-era general <a href="Marcus%20Vinicius%20%28consul%2019%20BC%29">Marcus Vinucius</a> (10 BC or 8 BC), also appears to distinguish the Bastarnae from neighbouring Celtic tribes: "Marcus Vinucius... governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome."

The names of three Bastarnae leaders are preserved in the ancient sources: Cotto, Clondicus, and Teutagonus These names have been identified as Celtic by some scholars. However, the names could also be Germanic, according to Müllenhoff, and thus do not assist determination of whether the Bastarnae were Celtic or Germanic.

Strabo includes the <a href="Roxolani">Roxolani</a>, generally considered by scholars to have been a <a href="Sarmatian">Sarmatian</a> tribe, in a list of Bastarnae subgroups. However, this may simply be an error due to the close proximity of the two peoples north of the Danube delta. In the 3rd century, the Greek historian <a href="Dio%20Cassius">Dio Cassius</a> states that the "Bastarnae are properly classed as Scythians" and "members of the Scythian race". Likewise, the 6th-century historian <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a>, reporting events around AD 280, refers to "the Bastarnae, a Scythian people". However, it appears that these late Greco-Roman chroniclers used the term "Scythian" more often in a geographical sense (i.e. inhabitants of the region they called Scythia i.e. the Pontic region north of the Danube) rather than in an ethnic one (i.e. members of the <a href="Scythians">Scythian</a> people, steppe nomads of Iranic origin, related to the Sarmatians, who had supplanted the Scythians' dominance of the steppes in the period BC). For example, Zosimus also routinely refers to the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, who were undoubtedly Germanic-speakers, as "Scythians".

It is possible that some Bastarnae may have been assimilated by the surrounding (and possibly dominant) Sarmatians, perhaps adopting their tongue (which belonged to the <a href="Iranian%20languages">Iranian</a> group of Indo-European languages) and/or Sarmatian customs. Thus Tacitus' comment that "mixed marriages are giving [the Bastarnae] to some extent the vile appearance of the Sarmatians". On the other hand, the Bastarnae maintained a separate name-identity until ca. AD 300, probably implying retention of their distinctive ethno-linguistic heritage until that time. It seems, on balance, likely that the core population of Bastarnae had always been, and continued to be, Germanic in language and culture.

According to Todd, traditional archaeology has not been able to construct a typology of Bastarnae material culture, and thus to ascribe particular archaeological sites to the Bastarnae. A complicating factor is that the regions where Bastarnae are attested contained a patchwork of peoples and cultures (Sarmatians, Scythians, Dacians, Thracians, Celts, Germans and others), some sedentary, some nomadic. In any event, post-1960's archaeological theory questions the validity of equating material "cultures", as defined by archaeologists, with distinct ethnic groups. On this view, it is impossible to attribute a "culture" to a particular ethnic group: it is likely that the material cultures discerned in the region belonged to several, if not all, of the groups inhabiting it. These cultures probably represent relatively large-scale socio-economic interactions between disparate communities of the broad region, possibly including mutually antagonistic groups.

It is not even certain whether the Bastarnae were <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a> or <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic (or semi-nomadic). Tacitus' statement that they were "German in their way of life and types of dwelling" implies a sedentary bias, but their close relations with the Sarmatians, who were nomadic, may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle for some Bastarnae, as does the wide geographical range of their attested inhabitation. If the Bastarnae were nomadic, then the sedentary "cultures" identified by archaeologists in their "lebensraum" would not represent them. Nomadic peoples generally leave scant traces, due to the impermanent materials and foundations used in the construction of their dwellings.

Scholars have identified two closely related sedentary "cultures" as possible candidates to represent the Bastarnae (among other peoples) as their locations broadly correspond to where ancient sources placed the Basternae: the <a href="Zarubintsy%20culture">Zarubintsy culture</a> lying in the forest-steppe zone in northern Ukraine-southern Belarus, and the Poieneşti-Lukashevka (<a href="Luc%C4%83%C5%9Feuca">Lucăşeuca</a>) culture in northern Moldavia. These cultures were characterised by agriculture, documented by numerous finds of sickles. Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types, with posts supporting the walls, a hearth in the middle, and large conical pits located nearby. Some sites were defended by ditches and banks, structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe. Inhabitants practiced cremation. Cremated remains were either placed in large, hand-made ceramic urns, or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne%20culture">La Tène</a>-type "fibulae" (attesting the continuing strength of Celtic influence in this region).

A major problem with associating Lukashevka and Zarubintsy with the Bastarnae is that both cultures had disappeared by the early 1st century AD, although the Bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the Roman <a href="Principate">Principate</a>. Another issue is that the Poieneşti-Lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the <a href="Costoboci">Costoboci</a>, a people considered ethnic-<a href="Dacians">Dacian</a> by mainstream scholarship, which inhabited northern Moldavia, according to Ptolemy (ca. AD 140). Indeed, Mircea Babeş and Silvia Theodor, the two Romanian archaeologists who identified Lukashevka as Bastarnic, nevertheless insisted that the majority of the population in the Lukashevka sphere (N. Moldavia) was "Geto-Dacian". A further problem is that neither of these cultures were present in the Danube delta region, where a major concentration of Bastarnae are attested by the ancient sources.

Starting in about AD 200, the <a href="Chernyakhov">Chernyakhov</a> culture became established in the W. Ukraine/Moldova region inhabited by the Bastarnae. The culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts, as well as of uniformity over a vast area. Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the <a href="Goth">Goth</a>ic "ethnos" into the region from the Northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian. Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, <a href="Early%20Slavs">proto-Slavs</a>, <a href="Carpi%20%28people%29">Carpi</a>, and possibly the Bastarnae.

The Bastarnae first appear in the historical record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in massive force. They did so at the invitation of their long-time ally, king <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V of Macedon</a>, a direct descendant of <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus</a>, one of the <a href="Diadochi">Diadochi</a>, the generals of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> who had shared out his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Romans in the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a> (200-197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army. After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate's dictats, Philip had been goaded beyond endurance by the incessant and devastating raiding of the <a href="Dardani">Dardani</a>, a warlike Thraco-Illyrian tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively. Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations in earlier times, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence. First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani. After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>/<a href="Skopje">Skopje</a> region), to ensure that the region was permanently subdued. In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast. Although he was aware that the Bastarnae were hardly likely to achieve the same success as <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> some 40 years earlier, and would most likely end up cut to pieces by the Romans, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece.

But Philip, now 60 years of age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive. The Bastarnae host was still "en route" through Thrace, where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals, who were unable (or unwilling) to provide them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through. Probably in the vicinity of <a href="Plovdiv">Philippopolis</a> (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide. The terrified local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of "Mons Donuca", the highest mountain in Thrace (<a href="Musala">Mt. Musala</a>, Rila Mts., Bulgaria). A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm. Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout. Back at their <a href="laager">wagon-laager</a> in the plain, around half the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving c. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia.

Philip's son and successor <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus</a>, while protesting his loyalty to Rome, deployed his Bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in Dardania, presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the Dardani the following summer. But in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the Dardani. The Bastarnae easily beat off the attackers, chased them back to their chief town, and besieged them. But they were surprised in the rear by a second force of Dardani, which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths, and proceeded to storm and ransack it. Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home. Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way. Despite the failure of Philip's Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state. Rome declared war on Perseus in 171 BC and after the Macedonian army was crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">Battle of Pydna</a> (168 BC), Macedonia was split up into 4 Roman puppet-cantons (167 BC). 21 years later, these were in turn abolished and annexed to the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> as the <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">province of Macedonia</a> (146 BC).

The Bastarnae first came into direct conflict with Rome as a result of expansion into the lower Danube region by the <a href="proconsuls">proconsuls</a> (governors) of Macedonia in the period 75-72 BC. <a href="Gaius%20Scribonius%20Curio">Gaius Scribonius Curio</a> (proconsul 75-3 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the <a href="Moesi">Moesi</a>, becoming the first Roman general to reach the river Danube with his army. His successor, <a href="Marcus%20Terentius%20Varro%20Lucullus">Marcus Licinius Lucullus</a> (brother of the famous <a href="Lucullus">Lucius Lucullus</a>), campaigned against the Thracian <a href="Bessi">Bessi</a> tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a>, the region between the Haemus (<a href="Balkan">Balkan</a>) mountain range and the Danube. In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of <a href="Scythia%20Minor">Scythia Minor</a> (modern <a href="Dobruja">Dobruja</a> region, Romania/Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome's <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> arch-enemy, king <a href="Mithridates%20VI">Mithridates VI</a> of <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a>, in the <a href="Third%20Mithridatic%20War">Third Mithridatic War</a> (73-63 BC).

The presence of Roman forces in the Danube delta was seen as a major threat by all the neighbouring transdanubian peoples: the Peucini Bastarnae, the Sarmatians and, most importantly, by <a href="Burebista">Burebista</a> (ruled 82-44 BC), king of the <a href="Getae">Getae</a>. The Getae occupied the region today called <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> as well as Scythia Minor and were either a <a href="Dacian%20language">Dacian</a>- or <a href="Thracian%20language">Thracian</a>- speaking people. Burebista had unified the Getae tribes into a single kingdom, for which the Greek cities were vital trade outlets. In addition, he had established his hegemony over neighbouring Sarmatian and Bastarnae tribes. At its peak, the Getae kingdom reportedly was able to muster 200,000 warriors. Burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against Roman encroachment, conducting many raids against Roman allies in <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> and Thrace, penetrating as far as Macedonia and <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>.

The coalition's main chance came in 62 BC, when the Greek cities rebelled against Roman rule. In 61 BC, the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of Macedonia, <a href="Gaius%20Antonius%20Hybrida">Gaius Antonius</a>, nicknamed "Hybrida" ("The Monster", an uncle of the famous <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>) led an army against the Greek cities. As his army approached <a href="Histria%20%28Sinoe%29">Histria (Sinoe)</a>, Antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion, leaving his infantry without cavalry cover, a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the Dardani. Dio implies that he did so out of cowardice, in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition. But it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force, probably <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>. A Bastarnae host, which had crossed the Danube to assist the Histrians, promptly attacked, surrounded and massacred the Roman infantry, capturing several of their "<a href="vexillum">vexilla</a>" (military standards). This battle resulted in the collapse of the Roman position on the lower Danube. Burebista apparently annexed the Greek cities (55-48 BC). At the same time, the subjugated "allied" tribes of Moesia and Thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with Rome, as they had to be re-conquered by <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> in 29-8 BC (see below).

For 44 BC, Roman <a href="dictator%20perpetuus">dictator-for-life</a> <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> planned to lead a major campaign to crush Burebista and his allies once and for all, but he was assassinated before it could start. However, the campaign was made redundant by Burebista's overthrow and death in the same year, after which his Getae empire fragmented into 4, later 5 independent petty kingdoms. These were militarily far weaker, as Strabo assessed their combined military potential at just 40,000 armed men, and were often involved in internecine warfare. The <a href="Geto-Dacians">Geto-Dacians</a> did not again become a threat to Roman hegemony in the lower Danube until the rise of <a href="Decebal">Decebal</a> 130 years later (AD 86).

Once he had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC, Caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire's southeastern European border to the line of the Danube from the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, the <a href="Dinaric%20Alps">Dinaric Alps</a> and Macedonia. The primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply-route between the Roman armies in the region.

On the lower Danube, which was given priority over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia. The Romans' target were thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from West to East) the <a href="Triballi">Triballi</a>, Moesi and those Getae who dwelt South of the Danube. The Bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers "Utus" (<a href="Vit">Vit</a>) and "Ciabrus" (<a href="Tsibritsa">Tsibritsa</a>), with their chief town at <a href="Oescus">Oescus</a> (Gigen, Bulgaria). In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of <a href="Gaius%20Antonius%20Hybrida">C. Antonius</a> at <a href="Histria%20%28Sinoe%29">Histria (Sinoe)</a> 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards. These were held in a powerful fortress called <a href="Genucla">Genucla</a> (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Romania, in the Danube delta region), controlled by <a href="Zyraxes">Zyraxes</a>, the local Getan king. The man selected for the task was <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus%20%28consul%2030%20BC%29">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>, grandson of <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Crassus</a> the <a href="triumvir">triumvir</a> and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC.

The Bastarnae provided the "casus belli" by crossing the Haemus and attacking the <a href="Dentheletae">Dentheletae</a>, a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies. Crassus marched to the Dentheletae's assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach. Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but they would not be drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa. Crassus now turned his attention to the Moesi, his prime target. After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae. Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem. Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood. As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid. The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon-train carrying their women and children, as these could not move through the trees. Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed. Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome's highest military honour, "<a href="spolia%20opima">spolia opima</a>", but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality. Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube. Nevertheless, a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort. Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of <a href="Rholes">Rholes</a>, a Getan petty king, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of "socius et amicus populi Romani" ("ally and friend of the Roman people").

The following year (28 BC), Crassus marched on Genucla. Petty king Zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the Danube into Scythia to seek aid from the Bastarnae. But before he was able to bring reinforcements, Genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the Romans. The strategic result of Crassus' campaigns was the permanent annexation of Moesia by Rome.

About a decade later, in 10 BC, the Bastarnae again clashed with Rome during Augustus' conquest of <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> (the "bellum Pannonicum" 14–9 BC). Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the <a href="Hungarian%20Plain">Hungarian Plain</a> by the Augustan-era general <a href="Marcus%20Vinicius%20%28consul%2019%20BC%29">Marcus Vinucius</a>: "Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC]...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the <a href="Cotini">Cotini</a>, Osi...[missing tribal name] and <a href="Anartes">Anartii</a> to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome." Most likely, the Bastarnae, in alliance with Dacians, were attempting to assist the hard-pressed Illyrian/Celtic tribes of Pannonia in their resistance to Rome.

It appears that in the final years of Augustus' rule, the Bastarnae made their peace with Rome. The "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>" ("Acts of the divine Augustus" AD 14), a self-congratulatory inscription commissioned by Augustus to list his achievements, states that he received an embassy from the Bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship.

It appears that a treaty was concluded and apparently proved remarkably effective, as no hostilities with the Bastarnae are recorded in surviving ancient sources until c. 175, some 160 years after Augustus' inscription was carved. But surviving evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the Bastarnae clashed with Rome during it. The Bastarnae may have been involved in the Dacian Wars of <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a> (86-88) and <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> (101-102 and 105-106), since these took place in the lower Danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes.

In the late 2nd century, the "Historia Augusta" mentions that in the rule of <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> (161-80), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the <a href="Costoboci">Costoboci</a> took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper Danube (the <a href="Marcomannic%20Wars">Marcomannic Wars</a>) to invade Roman territory.

During the late 2nd century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the <a href="Taifali">Taifali</a> and the <a href="Hasdingi">Hasdingi</a>, a branch of the <a href="Vandal">Vandal</a> people. This migration was part of a series of major population movements in the European "barbaricum" (the Roman term for regions outside their empire). The Goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region.

Under the leadership of the Goths, a series of major invasions of the Roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from c. 238 onwards. The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus' and other chroniclers' tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term "Scythians" - meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific <a href="Iranic%20languages">Iranic</a>-speaking people called the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>. Thus, in 250-1, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abrittus">Battle of Abrittus</a> and the slaying of the emperor <a href="Decius">Decius</a> (251). This disaster was the start of the <a href="Third%20Century%20Crisis">Third Century Crisis</a> of the Roman empire, a period of military and economic chaos. At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the <a href="plague%20of%20Cyprian">plague of Cyprian</a> (251-70). The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier <a href="Antonine%20Plague">Antonine plague</a> (166-80), which probably killed 15-30% of the empire's inhabitants.

Taking advantage of Roman military disarray, a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire. The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253-8 and 260-8. The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/8 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river "Tyras" (<a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a>). The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked. The barbarians sailed along the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success. They then attacked the provincial capital <a href="Marcianopolis">Marcianopolis</a> (Devnya, Bulg.), also in vain. Sailing on through the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a>, the expedition laid siege to <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> in Macedonia. Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by emperor <a href="Claudius%20II">Claudius II</a> (r. 268-70) at <a href="Battle%20of%20Naissus">Naissus</a> (269).

Claudius II was the first of a sequence of military emperors (the so-called "<a href="Illyrian%20emperors">Illyrian emperors</a>" from their main ethnic origin) who restored order in the empire in the late 3rd century. These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. But it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire. In the 4th century, such communities were known as "<a href="laeti">laeti</a>".

The emperor <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius%20Probus">Probus</a> (r. 276-82) is recorded as resettling 100,000 Bastarnae in Moesia, in addition to other peoples (Goths, Gepids and Vandals). The Bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor, while the other resettled peoples mutinied while Probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the Danubian provinces far and wide. A further massive transfer of Bastarnae was carried out by emperor <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> (ruled 284-305) after he and his colleague <a href="Galerius">Galerius</a> defeated a coalition of Bastarnae and <a href="Carpi%20%28Dacian%20tribe%29">Carpi</a> in 299.

The remaining transdanubian Bastarnae disappear into historical obscurity in the late empire. Neither of the main ancient sources for this period, <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> and <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a>, mention the Bastarnae in their accounts of the 4th century, possibly implying the loss of their separate identity, presumably assimilated by the regional hegemons, the Goths. Such assimilation would have been facilitated if, as is possible, the Bastarnae spoke an <a href="East%20Germanic">East Germanic</a> language closely related to <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a>. If the Bastarnae remained an identifiable group, it is highly likely that they participated in the vast Gothic-led migration, driven by <a href="Hun">Hun</a>nic pressure, that was admitted into Moesia by emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a> in 376 and eventually defeated and killed Valens at <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Adrianople</a> in 378. Although Ammianus refers to the migrants collectively as "Goths", he states that, in addition, "Taifali and other tribes" were involved.

However, after a gap of 150 years, there is a final mention of Bastarnae in the mid-5th century. In 451, the <a href="Hun">Hun</a>nic leader <a href="Attila">Attila</a> invaded Gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ch%C3%A2lons">Battle of Châlons</a> by a Roman-led coalition under the general <a href="Flavius%20Aetius">Aetius</a>. Attila's host, according to <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, included contingents from the "innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway." One such were the Bastarnae, according to the Gallic nobleman <a href="Sidonius%20Apollinaris">Sidonius Apollinaris</a>. However, E.A. Thompson argues that Sidonius' mention of Bastarnae at Chalons is probably false: his purpose was to write a <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> and not a history, and Sidonius added some spurious names to the list of real participants (e.g. <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>, <a href="Scirii">Sciri</a> and <a href="Franks">Franks</a>) for dramatic effect.

Bohemia

Bohemia (; ; ; ; ; ; ) is the westernmost and largest <a href="historical%20region">historical region</a> of the <a href="Czech%20lands">Czech lands</a> in the present-day <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> and <a href="Czech%20Silesia">Czech Silesia</a>, especially in a historical context, such as the <a href="Lands%20of%20the%20Bohemian%20Crown">Lands of the Bohemian Crown</a> ruled by <a href="List%20of%20Bohemian%20monarchs">Bohemian kings</a>.

Bohemia was a <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bohemia">duchy</a> of <a href="Great%20Moravia">Great Moravia</a>, later an independent principality, a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">kingdom</a> in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, and subsequently a part of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a> and the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>. After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the establishment of an <a href="History%20of%20Czechoslovakia%20%281918%E2%80%9338%29">independent Czechoslovak state</a>, Bohemia became a part of <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. Between 1938 and 1945, border regions with sizeable German-speaking minorities of all three Czech lands were joined to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> as the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>. 

The remainder of Czech territory became the <a href="Second%20Czechoslovak%20Republic">Second Czechoslovak Republic</a> and was subsequently occupied as the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</a>, In 1969, the Czech lands (including Bohemia) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the <a href="Czech%20Socialist%20Republic">Czech Socialist Republic</a>. In 1990, the name was changed to the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, which become a separate state in 1993 with the <a href="dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia">dissolution of Czechoslovakia</a>. 
Until 1948, Bohemia was an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia as one of its "lands" ("země"). Since then, administrative reforms have replaced self-governing lands with a modified system of "regions" ("kraje") which do not follow the borders of the historical Czech lands (or the regions from the 1960 and 2000 reforms). However, the three lands are mentioned in the preamble of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic">Constitution of the Czech Republic</a>: "We, citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia…" 

Bohemia had an area of and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republic's 10.5 million inhabitants. Bohemia was bordered in the south by <a href="Upper%20Austria">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Austria">Lower Austria</a> (both in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>), in the west by <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and in the north by <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> and <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a> (all in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>), in the northeast by <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> (in <a href="Poland">Poland</a>), and in the east by <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> (also part of the Czech Republic). Bohemia's borders were mostly marked by mountain ranges such as the <a href="Bohemian%20Forest">Bohemian Forest</a>, the <a href="Ore%20Mountains%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Ore Mountains</a>, and the <a href="Krkono%C5%A1e">Krkonoše</a>, a part of the <a href="Sudetes">Sudetes</a> range; the Bohemian-Moravian border roughly follows the Elbe-Donau watershed.

In the 2nd century BC, the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> were competing for dominance in <a href="northern%20Italy">northern Italy</a>, with various peoples including the <a href="Boii">Boii</a>. The Romans defeated the Boii at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Placentia%20%28194%20BC%29">Battle of Placentia (194 BC)</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina%20%28193%20BC%29">Battle of Mutina (193 BC)</a>. After this, many of the Boii retreated north across the Alps.

Much later Roman authors refer to the area they had once occupied (the "desert of the Boii" as <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> called it) as "Boiohaemum". The earliest mention was by <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>' "<a href="Germania%20%28book%29">Germania</a>" 28 (written at the end of the 1st century AD), and later mentions of the same name are in Strabo and <a href="Velleius%20Paterculus">Velleius Paterculus</a>. The name appears to include the tribal name "Boi-" plus the <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Germanic</a> element *"haimaz" "home" (whence Gothic "haims", German "Heim", English "home"). This Boiohaemum was apparently isolated to the area where King <a href="Marobod">Marobod</a>'s kingdom was centred, within the <a href="Hercynian%20forest">Hercynian forest</a>.

The Czech name "Čechy" is derived from the name of the Slavic ethnic group, the <a href="Czechs">Czechs</a>, who settled in the area during the 6th or 7th century AD.

Bohemia, like neighbouring <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, is named after the <a href="Boii">Boii</a>, who were a large <a href="Celtic%20nations">Celtic nation</a> known to the Romans for their migrations and settlement in northern Italy and other places. Another part of the nation moved west with the <a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a> into southern France, which was one of the events leading to the interventions of Julius Caesar's Gaulish campaign of 58 BC. The emigration of the Helvetii and Boii left southern Germany and Bohemia a lightly inhabited "desert" into which <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>c peoples arrived, speaking Germanic languages, and became dominant over remaining Celtic groups. To the south, over the Danube, the Romans extended their empire, and to the southeast in Hungaria, were <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatian</a> peoples.

In the area of modern Bohemia the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> and other Suebic groups were led by their king <a href="Marobodus">Marobodus</a>, after suffering defeat to Roman forces in Germany. He took advantage of the natural defenses provided by its mountains and forests. They were able to maintain a strong alliance with neighbouring tribes including (at different times) the <a href="Lugii">Lugii</a>, <a href="Quadi">Quadi</a>, <a href="Hermunduri">Hermunduri</a>, <a href="Semnones">Semnones</a>, and <a href="Buri%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Buri</a>, which was sometimes partly controlled by the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and sometimes in conflict with it, for example in the second century when they fought <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>.

In late classical times and the early <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, two new Suebic groupings appeared to the west of Bohemia in southern Germany, the <a href="Alemanni">Alemanni</a> (in the Helvetian desert), and the Bavarians (<a href="Baiuvarii">Baiuvarii</a>). Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal. With them were also tribes who had pushed from the east, such as the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, and <a href="Alans">Alans</a>. 

Other groups pushed southwards towards <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>. The last known mention of the kingdom of the Marcomanni, concerning a queen named <a href="Fritigil">Fritigil</a> is in the 4th century, and she was thought to have lived in or near Pannonia. The Suebian <a href="Langobardi">Langobardi</a>, who moved over many generations from the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, via the Elbe and Pannonia to Italy, recorded in a <a href="Origo%20Gentis%20Langobardorum">tribal history</a> a time spent in "Bainaib".

After this <a href="migration%20period">migration period</a>, Bohemia was partially repopulated around the 6th century, and eventually <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> tribes arrived from the east, and their language began to replace the older Germanic, Celtic and <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatian</a> ones. These are precursors of today's <a href="Czech%20people">Czechs</a>, though the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate. The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves. The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> left Bohemia (c. 568 AD). Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by <a href="Samo">Samo</a>'s tribal confederation. His death marked the end of the old "Slavonic" confederation, the second attempt to establish such a Slavonic union after <a href="Carantania">Carantania</a> in <a href="Carinthia%20%28province%29">Carinthia</a>.

Other sources ("<a href="Descriptio%20civitatum%20et%20regionum%20ad%20septentrionalem%20plagam%20Danubii">Descriptio civitatum et regionum ad septentrionalem plagam Danubii</a>", Bavaria, 800–850) divide the population of Bohemia at this time into the Merehani, Marharaii, Beheimare (Bohemani) and Fraganeo. (The suffix "-ani" or "-ni" means "people of-"). Christianity first appeared in the early 9th century, but only became dominant much later, in the 10th or 11th century.

The 9th century was crucial for the future of Bohemia. The <a href="Manorialism">manorial system</a> sharply declined, as it did in Bavaria. The influence of the central "Fraganeo-Czechs" grew, as a result of the important cultic centre in their territory. They were Slavic-speaking and thus contributed to the transformation of diverse neighbouring populations into a new nation named and led by them with a united "slavic" ethnic consciousness.

Bohemia was made a part of the early Slavic state of <a href="Great%20Moravia">Great Moravia</a>, under the rule of <a href="Svatopluk%20I">Svatopluk I</a> (r. 870–894). After Svatopluk's death Great Moravia was weakened by years of internal conflict and constant warfare, ultimately collapsing and fragmenting due to the continual incursions of the invading nomadic <a href="Magyars">Magyars</a>. Bohemia's initial incorporation into the Moravian Empire resulted in the extensive <a href="Christianization%20of%20Bohemia">Christianization of the population</a>. A native monarchy arose to the throne, and Bohemia came under the rule of the <a href="P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty">Přemyslid dynasty</a>, which would rule the Czech lands for the next several hundred years.

The Přemyslids secured their frontiers from the remnant Asian interlocurs, after the collapse of the Moravian state, by entering into a state of semi-vassalage to the Frankish rulers. This alliance was facilitated by Bohemia's conversion to Christianity, in the 9th century. Continuing close relations were developed with the East <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> kingdom, which devolved from the <a href="Carolingians">Carolingian</a> Empire, into East Francia, eventually becoming the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

After a decisive victory of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia over invading Magyars in the 955 <a href="Battle%20of%20Lechfeld">Battle of Lechfeld</a>, <a href="Boleslav%20I%20of%20Bohemia">Boleslaus I</a> of Bohemia was granted the <a href="March%20of%20Moravia">March of Moravia</a> by German emperor <a href="Otto%20the%20Great">Otto the Great</a>. Bohemia would remain a largely autonomous state under the Holy Roman Empire for several decades. The jurisdiction of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> was definitively reasserted when <a href="Jaromir%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia">Jaromír of Bohemia</a> was granted fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia by Emperor <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">King Henry II</a> of the Holy Roman Empire, with the promise that he hold it as a vassal once he re-occupied Prague with a German army in 1004, ending the rule of <a href="Boleslaw%20I%20of%20Poland">Boleslaw I of Poland</a>.

The first to use the title of "King of Bohemia" were the Přemyslid dukes <a href="Vratislav%20II%20of%20Bohemia">Vratislav II</a> (1085) and <a href="Vladislav%20II%20of%20Bohemia">Vladislav II</a> (1158), but their heirs would return to the title of <a href="duke">duke</a>. The title of king became hereditary under <a href="Ottokar%20I%20of%20Bohemia">Ottokar I</a> (1198). His grandson <a href="Ottokar%20II%20of%20Bohemia">Ottokar II</a> (king from 1253–1278) conquered a short-lived empire which contained modern <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>. The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as the court sought to replace losses from the brief <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe">Mongol invasion of Europe</a> in 1241. Germans settled primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns throughout the kingdom.

The <a href="House%20of%20Luxembourg">House of Luxembourg</a> accepted the invitation to the Bohemian throne with the marriage to the Premyslid heiress, Elizabeth and the crowning subsequent of <a href="John%20I%20of%20Bohemia">John I of Bohemia</a> in 1310. His son, <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV</a> became King of Bohemia in 1346. He founded <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">Charles University in Prague</a>, central Europe's first university, two years later. 

His reign brought Bohemia to its peak both politically and in total area, resulting in his being the first King of Bohemia to also be elected as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Under his rule the <a href="Bohemian%20crown">Bohemian crown</a> controlled such diverse lands as <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>, <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, <a href="Upper%20Lusatia">Upper Lusatia</a> and <a href="Lower%20Lusatia">Lower Lusatia</a>, Brandenburg, an area around <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> called New Bohemia, <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, and several small towns scattered around Germany.

During the ecumenical <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a> in 1415, <a href="Jan%20Hus">Jan Hus</a>, the <a href="Rector%20%28academia%29">rector</a> of Charles University and a prominent reformer and religious thinker, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake as a <a href="Heresy">heretic</a>. The verdict was passed despite the fact that Hus was granted formal protection by Emperor <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund of Luxembourg</a> prior to the journey. Hus was invited to attend the council to defend himself and the Czech positions in the religious court, but with the emperor's approval, he was executed on 6 July 1415. The execution of Hus, as well as five consecutive papal <a href="crusades">crusades</a> against followers of Hus, forced the Bohemians to defend themselves. Their defense and rebellion against Roman Catholics became known as the <a href="Hussite%20Wars">Hussite Wars</a>.

The uprising against imperial forces was led by a former mercenary, <a href="Jan%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEka">Jan Žižka</a> of Trocnov. As the leader of the Hussite armies, he used innovative tactics and weapons, such as howitzers, pistols, and fortified wagons, which were revolutionary for the time, and established Žižka as a great general who never lost a battle.

After Žižka's death, <a href="Prokop%20the%20Great">Prokop the Great</a> took over the command for the army, and under his lead the Hussites were victorious for another ten years, to the sheer terror of Europe. The Hussite cause gradually splintered into two main factions, the moderate <a href="Utraquism">Utraquists</a> and the more fanatic <a href="Taborite">Taborite</a>s. The <a href="Utraquists">Utraquists</a> began to lay the groundwork for an agreement with the Catholic Church and found the more radical views of the Taborites distasteful. Additionally, with general <a href="war-weariness">war-weariness</a> and yearning for order, the Utraquists were able to eventually defeat the Taborites in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lipany">Battle of Lipany</a> in 1434. Sigismund said after the battle that "only the Bohemians could defeat the Bohemians."

Despite an apparent victory for the Catholics, the Bohemian Utraquists were still strong enough to negotiate <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> in 1436. This happened in the so-called Basel Compacts, declaring peace and freedom between Catholics and Utraquists. It would only last for a short period of time, as <a href="Pope%20Pius%20II">Pope Pius II</a> declared the Basel Compacts to be invalid in 1462.

In 1458, <a href="George%20of%20Podebrady">George of Podebrady</a> was elected to ascend to the Bohemian throne. He is remembered for his attempt to set up a pan-European "Christian League", which would form all the states of Europe into a community based on religion. In the process of negotiating, he appointed <a href="Leo%20of%20Rozmital">Leo of Rozmital</a> to tour the European courts and to conduct the talks. However, the negotiations were not completed, because George's position was substantially damaged over time by his deteriorating relationship with the Pope.

After the death of King <a href="Louis%20II%20of%20Hungary%20and%20Bohemia">Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moh%C3%A1cs">Battle of Mohács</a> in 1526, Archduke <a href="Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand</a> of <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Austria</a> became the new King of Bohemia and the country became a constituent state of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a>.

Bohemia enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1620, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period. In 1609, Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolph II</a>, who made Prague again the capital of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Empire</a> at the time, himself a Roman Catholic, was moved by the Bohemian nobility to publish "Maiestas Rudolphina", which confirmed the older "Confessio Bohemica" of 1575.

After Emperor <a href="Matthias%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Matthias II</a> and then King of Bohemia <a href="Ferdinand%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand II</a> (later Holy Roman Emperor) began oppressing the rights of Protestants in Bohemia, the resulting <a href="Bohemian%20Revolt">Bohemian Revolt</a> led to outbreak of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> in 1618. Elector <a href="Frederick%20V%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Frederick V</a> of the <a href="Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Electorate of the Palatinate</a>, a Protestant, was elected by the Bohemian nobility to replace Ferdinand on the Bohemian throne, and was known as the <a href="Winter%20King">Winter King</a>. Frederick's wife, the popular <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth Stuart</a> and subsequently Elizabeth of Bohemia, known as the Winter Queen or Queen of Hearts, was the daughter of King <a href="James%20VI%20of%20Scotland">James VI of Scotland</a>. 

After Frederick's defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Mountain">Battle of White Mountain</a> in 1620, 27 Bohemian estates leaders together with <a href="Jan%20Jesenius">Jan Jesenius</a>, rector of the <a href="Charles%20University">Charles University</a> of Prague were executed on the Prague's Old Town Square on 21 June 1621 and the rest were exiled from the country; their lands were then given to Catholic loyalists (mostly of Bavarian and Saxon origin), this ended the pro-reformation movement in Bohemia and also ended the role of Prague as ruling city of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

In the so-called "renewed constitution" of 1627, the German language was established as a second official language in the Czech lands. The Czech language formally remained the first language in the kingdom, however, both German and Latin were widely spoken among the ruling classes, although German became increasingly dominant, while Czech was spoken in much of the countryside.

The formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian <a href="Diet%20%28assembly%29">Diet</a> approved administrative reform in 1749. It included the indivisibility of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy%23Rulers%20of%20the%20Habsburg%20Monarchy%2C%201526%E2%80%931918">Habsburg Empire</a> and the centralization of rule; this essentially meant the merging of the Royal Bohemian Chancellery with the Austrian Chancellery.

At the end of the 18th century, the <a href="Czech%20National%20Revival">Czech National Revival</a> movement, in cooperation with part of the Bohemian aristocracy, started a campaign for restoration of the kingdom's historic rights, whereby the Czech language was to regain its historical role and replace German as the language of administration. The <a href="enlightened%20absolutism">enlightened absolutism</a> of <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a> and <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold II</a>, who introduced minor language concessions, showed promise for the Czech movement, but many of these reforms were later rescinded. During the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Habsburg%20areas">Revolution of 1848</a>, many Czech nationalists called for autonomy for Bohemia from Habsburg Austria, but the revolutionaries were defeated. The old Bohemian Diet, one of the last remnants of the independence, was dissolved, although the Czech language experienced a rebirth as <a href="romantic%20nationalism">romantic nationalism</a> developed among the Czechs.

In 1861, a new elected Bohemian Diet was established. The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown (<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>, <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Moravia">Margraviate of Moravia</a>, and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Upper%20and%20Lower%20Silesia">Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia</a>) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy ("state rights program"), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called "Verfassungstreue"). 

After the defeat of Austria in the <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> in 1866, Hungarian politicians achieved the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Compromise%20of%201867">Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</a>, ostensibly creating equality between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. An attempt by the Czechs to create a tripartite monarchy (Austria-Hungary-Bohemia) failed in 1871. The "state rights program" remained the official platform of all Czech political parties (except for social democrats) until 1918.

After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Bohemia (as the largest and most populous land) became the core of the newly formed country of <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, which combined Bohemia, <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>, <a href="Czech%20Silesia">Czech Silesia</a>, <a href="Upper%20Hungary">Upper Hungary</a> (present-day <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>) and <a href="Carpathian%20Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a> into one state. Under its first president, <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Masaryk">Tomáš Masaryk</a>, Czechoslovakia became a liberal democratic republic but serious issues emerged regarding the Czech majority's relationship with the native German and Hungarian minorities.

Following the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> in 1938, the border regions of Bohemia historically inhabited predominantly by ethnic Germans (the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>) were annexed to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. This was the only time in Bohemian history that its territory was politically divided. The remnants of Bohemia and Moravia were then annexed by Germany in 1939, while the Slovak lands became the separate <a href="Slovak%20Republic%20%281939-1945%29">Slovak Republic</a>, a puppet state of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. From 1939 to 1945 Bohemia, (without the Sudetenland), together with Moravia formed the German <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</a> ("Reichsprotektorat Böhmen und Mähren"). 

Any open opposition to German occupation was brutally suppressed by the Nazi authorities and many Czech patriots were executed as a result. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> ended in 1945, the vast majority of remaining Germans were <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Czechoslovakia%20after%20World%20War%20II">expelled</a> by force by the order of the re-established Czechoslovak central government, based on the Potsdam Agreement, and their property was confiscated by the Czech authorities. This severely depopulated the area and from this moment on locales were only referred to in their Czech equivalents regardless of their previous demographic makeup. 

The Communist Party won the most votes in free elections but not a <a href="majority">simple majority</a>. <a href="Klement%20Gottwald">Klement Gottwald</a>, the communist leader, became Prime Minister of a coalition government. 

In February 1948 the non-communist members of the government resigned in protest against arbitrary measures by the communists and their Soviet protectors in many of the state's institutions. Gottwald and the communists responded with a coup d'état and installed a pro-Soviet authoritarian state. In 1949, Bohemia ceased to be an administrative unit of Czechoslovakia, as the country was divided into administrative regions that did not follow the historical borders. 

In 1989, <a href="Agnes%20of%20Bohemia">Agnes of Bohemia</a> became the first saint from a <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>an country to be canonized by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> before the "<a href="Velvet%20Revolution">Velvet Revolution</a>" later that year.

After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20Czechoslovakia">dissolution of Czechoslovakia</a> in 1993, the territory of Bohemia remained in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. The new <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic">Constitution of the Czech Republic</a> provided for higher administrative units to be established, providing for the possibility of Bohemia as an administrative unit, but did not specify the form they would take. A constitutional act in 1997 rejected the restoration of self-governing historical Czech lands and decided for the regional system that has been in use since 2000. <a href="Petr%20Pithart">Petr Pithart</a>, former Czech prime minister and president of the <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic">Senate</a> at the time, remained one of the main advocates of the land system, claiming that the primary reason for its refusal was the fear of possible Moravian separatism.

Bohemia thus remains a <a href="historical%20region">historical region</a>, and its administration is divided between the Prague, <a href="Central%20Bohemian%20Region">Central Bohemia</a>, <a href="Pilsen%20Region">Plzeň</a>, <a href="Carlsbad%20Region">Karlovy Vary</a>, <a href="%C3%9Ast%C3%AD%20nad%20Labem%20Region">Ústí nad Labem</a>, <a href="Liberec%20Region">Liberec</a>, and <a href="Hradec%20Kr%C3%A1lov%C3%A9%20Region">Hradec Králové</a> <a href="Regions%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic">Regions</a>, as well as parts of the <a href="Pardubice%20Region">Pardubice</a>, <a href="Vyso%C4%8Dina%20Region">Vysočina</a>, <a href="South%20Bohemian%20Region">South Bohemian</a> and <a href="South%20Moravian%20Region">South Moravian Region</a>s. In addition to their use in the names of the regions, the historical land names remain in use in names of municipalities, cadastral areas, railway stations or geographical names. The distinction and border between the Czech lands is also preserved in <a href="Czech%20language">local dialects</a>.

The area around <a href="K%C5%82odzko">Kłodzko</a> (; ; ) in south-western <a href="Poland">Poland</a> was culturally and traditionally a part of Bohemia. <a href="K%C5%82odzko%20Land">Kłodzko Land</a> has now been a part of <a href="Lower%20Silesia">Lower Silesia</a> since its conquest by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a> in 1763. Referred to as "Little <a href="Prague">Prague</a>" (), the <a href="K%C5%82odzko%20Valley">Kłodzko Valley</a> region on the <a href="Nysa%20K%C5%82odzka">Nysa Kłodzka</a> river was the focus of several attempts to reincorporate the area into <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, one of several <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Czechoslovak%20border%20conflicts">Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts</a>. 

The last attempt occurred in May 1945 when <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> tried to annex the area on behalf of the <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> minority present in the western part of the <a href="K%C5%82odzko%20Valley">Kłodzko Valley</a> and known as the "<a href="Czech%20Corner">Czech Corner</a>". Pressure brought on by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> led to a ceasing of military operations, with the Czech minority being expelled to <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and Czechoslovakia. According to <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, the area remained part of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Prague">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague</a> until 1972.

Capitalizing on interest regarding the <a href="Kladsko">Kladsko</a> area in the Czech national psyche, a special tourist area in the <a href="N%C3%A1chod%20District">Náchod District</a> has been designated as the "Kladsko Borderland Tourist Area" (tourism district; ). This area, entirely within the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, was formerly known as the "<a href="Alois%20Jir%C3%A1sek">Jirásek</a>'s Region" (), "<a href="Adr%C5%A1pach%20rocks">Adršpach rocks</a>" ().

BBC Radio 1

BBC Radio 1 is a British <a href="radio%20broadcasting">radio station</a> operated by the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> which also broadcasts internationally, specialising in modern and current <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> and chart hits throughout the day. Radio 1 provides alternative genres after 7:00 pm, including electronic dance, hip hop, rock, indie or interviews. It was launched in 1967 to meet the demand for music generated by <a href="pirate%20radio">pirate radio</a> stations, when the average age of the UK population was 27. Recently, the BBC claimed that it still targets the 15–29 age group, although the average age of its UK audience in 2008 had risen to 33. BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991.

Radio 1 was established in 1967 (along with the more <a href="Middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29">middle of the road</a> <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">BBC Radio 2</a>) as a successor to the <a href="BBC%20Light%20Programme">BBC Light Programme</a>, which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945. Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore <a href="Pirate%20radio%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">pirate radio</a> stations such as <a href="Radio%20Caroline">Radio Caroline</a> and <a href="Wonderful%20Radio%20London">Radio London</a>, which had been outlawed by <a href="Marine%2C%20%26amp%3Bc.%2C%20Broadcasting%20%28Offences%29%20Act%201967">Act of Parliament</a>. Radio 1 was launched at 6:55 am on Saturday 30 September 1967.

The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was <a href="Tony%20Blackburn">Tony Blackburn</a>, whose cheery style, first heard on <a href="Radio%20Caroline">Radio Caroline</a> and <a href="Wonderful%20Radio%20London">Radio London</a>, won him the prime slot on what became known as the "Radio 1 Breakfast Show". The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, Robin Scott, and a jingle, recorded at <a href="PAMS">PAMS</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, beginning "The voice of Radio 1" – were "... And, good morning everyone. Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1". This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio. The first music to be heard on the station was "Theme One", specially composed for the launch by <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>. It was followed by an extract from "Beefeaters" by <a href="Johnny%20Dankworth">Johnny Dankworth</a>. The first complete record played on Radio 1 was "<a href="Flowers%20in%20the%20Rain">Flowers in the Rain</a>" by <a href="The%20Move">The Move</a>. The second single was "<a href="Massachusetts%20%28Bee%20Gees%20song%29">Massachusetts</a>" by <a href="Bee%20Gees">The Bee Gees</a>. The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter exciting considerable media interest.
The initial rota of staff included <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> and a gaggle of others, some hired from pirates, such as <a href="Keith%20Skues">Keith Skues</a>, <a href="Ed%20Stewart">Ed Stewart</a>, <a href="Mike%20Raven">Mike Raven</a>, David Ryder, Jim Fisher, <a href="Jimmy%20Young%20%28broadcaster%29">Jimmy Young</a>, <a href="Dave%20Cash%20%28disc%20jockey%29">Dave Cash</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Everett">Kenny Everett</a>, <a href="Simon%20Dee">Simon Dee</a>, <a href="Terry%20Wogan">Terry Wogan</a>, Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, <a href="Tommy%20Vance">Tommy Vance</a>, <a href="Chris%20Denning">Chris Denning</a>, <a href="Emperor%20Rosko">Emperor Rosko</a>, <a href="Pete%20Murray%20%28DJ%29">Pete Murray</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Holness">Bob Holness</a>. Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week, ("Midday Spin.") <a href="Annie%20Nightingale">Annie Nightingale</a>, who joined in 1970, was Britain's first female DJ and is now the longest serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times.

Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">Radio 2</a> and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as <a href="Jimmy%20Young%20%28broadcaster%29">Jimmy Young</a> being in their 40s. The very fact that it was part of an "establishment" institution such as the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> was a turn-off for some, and <a href="needle%20time">needle time</a> restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had. It also had limited finances (partially because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives.

Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows). In the early-mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work. The popularity of Radio 1's touring summer live broadcasts the <a href="Radio%201%20Roadshow">Radio 1 Roadshow</a> – usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road – drew some of the largest crowds of the decade. The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from <a href="Radio%20Luxembourg%20%28English%29">Radio Luxembourg</a> and <a href="Manx%20Radio">Manx Radio</a> in the Isle of Man. (<a href="Independent%20Local%20Radio">Independent Local Radio</a> did not begin until October 1973 and took many years to cover virtually all of the UK). <a href="Alan%20Freeman">Alan Freeman</a>'s 'Saturday Rock Show' was voted 'Best Radio Show' 5 years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery.

In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under <a href="Matthew%20Bannister">Matthew Bannister</a>. One of these "<a href="Loud%27n%27proud">Loud'n'proud</a>" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and was aired from August 1993). Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor <a href="Gay%20Pride">Gay Pride</a> event in 1994. Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993. His aim was to rid the station of its '<a href="Smashie%20and%20Nicey">Smashie and Nicey</a>' image and make it appeal to the under 25s. Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history. Many long-standing DJs, such as <a href="Simon%20Bates">Simon Bates</a>, <a href="Dave%20Lee%20Travis">Dave Lee Travis</a>, <a href="Alan%20Freeman">Alan Freeman</a>, <a href="Bob%20Harris%20%28radio%29">Bob Harris</a>, <a href="Gary%20Davies">Gary Davies</a>, and later <a href="Steve%20Wright%20%28DJ%29">Steve Wright</a>, <a href="Bruno%20Brookes">Bruno Brookes</a> and <a href="Johnnie%20Walker%20%28DJ%29">Johnnie Walker</a> left the station or were sacked, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was banned from the daytime <a href="playlist">playlist</a>.

Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, <a href="BBC%20GLR">GLR</a>) with <a href="Emma%20Freud">Emma Freud</a> and <a href="Danny%20Baker">Danny Baker</a>. Another problem was that, at the time, <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">Radio 2</a> was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the <a href="BBC%20Light%20Programme">Light Programme</a>, and commercial radio, which was targeting the "Radio 1 and a half" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1.

After the departure of <a href="Steve%20Wright%20%28DJ%29">Steve Wright</a>, who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired <a href="Chris%20Evans%20%28presenter%29">Chris Evans</a> to present the prime morning slot in April 1995. Evans was a popular but controversial presenter who was eventually sacked in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week. Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by <a href="Mark%20and%20Lard">Mark and Lard</a> – <a href="Mark%20Radcliffe">Mark Radcliffe</a> (along with his sidekick <a href="Marc%20Riley">Marc Riley</a>), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them. They were replaced by <a href="Zo%C3%AB%20Ball">Zoë Ball</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Greening">Kevin Greening</a> eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter. The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> in the mid-90s – bands like <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>, <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> and <a href="Pulp%20%28band%29">Pulp</a> were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them. Documentaries like John Peel's "Lost in Music" which looked at the influence that the use of <a href="drugs">drugs</a> have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside <a href="Broadcasting%20House">Broadcasting House</a>.

Later in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop (<a href="boy%20bands">boy bands</a> and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts. New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of <a href="rave">rave</a> culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ <a href="Pete%20Tong">Pete Tong</a> amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the <a href="Essential%20Mix">Essential Mix</a> where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as <a href="Judge%20Jules">Judge Jules</a>, <a href="Danny%20Rampling">Danny Rampling</a> and <a href="Seb%20Fontaine">Seb Fontaine</a> all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in <a href="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>.

Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups. Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day. Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as <a href="The%20Surgery%20with%20Aled">The Surgery with Aled</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Friction">Bobby Friction</a> and <a href="DJ%20Nihal">Nihal</a>, "The Evening Session" with <a href="Steve%20Lamacq">Steve Lamacq</a> and its successor <a href="Zane%20Lowe">Zane Lowe</a>. Its website has also been well received.
However, the breakfast show and the <a href="UK%20Top%2040">UK Top 40</a> continued to struggle. In 2000, Zoë Ball was replaced in the mornings by friend and fellow <a href="ladette">ladette</a> <a href="Sara%20Cox">Sara Cox</a>, but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall. In 2004 Cox was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Moyles">Chris Moyles</a>. The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as <a href="The%20Chris%20Moyles%20Show">The Chris Moyles Show</a> and it increased its audience, ahead of <a href="Today%20programme">The Today Programme</a> on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">Radio 4</a> as the second most popular breakfast show (after <a href="The%20Chris%20Evans%20Breakfast%20Show">The Chris Evans Breakfast Show</a> hosted by <a href="Chris%20Evans%20%28presenter%29">Chris Evans</a>). Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the 'Wake up with Wogan' show; in 2006, for example, creating a 'SAY NO TO WOGAN' campaign live on-air. This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time – Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles.
The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host <a href="Mark%20Goodier">Mark Goodier</a>, amid falling single sales in the UK. Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's <a href="Pepsi%20Chart%20%28UK%29">Network Chart</a> overtook it in the ratings for the first time. However, the BBC denied he was being sacked. The BBC show now competes with networked commercial radio's <a href="The%20Big%20Top%2040%20Show">The Big Top 40 Show</a> which is broadcast at the same time.

Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as <a href="Johnnie%20Walker%20%28DJ%29">Johnnie Walker</a>, <a href="Bob%20Harris%20%28radio%29">Bob Harris</a> and <a href="Steve%20Wright%20%28DJ%29">Steve Wright</a>) have joined <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">Radio 2</a> which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s.
The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general. In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, <a href="Scott%20Mills">Scott Mills</a> and <a href="Zane%20Lowe">Zane Lowe</a> all won gold <a href="Radio%20Academy%20Awards">Sony Radio Awards</a>, while the station itself came away with the best station award.
A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre. Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows.
Following the death of <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> in October 2004, <a href="Annie%20Nightingale">Annie Nightingale</a> is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970.

The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector. In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by <a href="John%20Myers%20%28radio%20executive%29">John Myers</a>. His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was "to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings."

The controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt. Ben Cooper answers to the Director of BBC Audio and Music, Tim Davie.

On 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced. Skream & Benga, <a href="Toddla%20T">Toddla T</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Sloth">Charlie Sloth</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Friction">Friction</a> replaced Judge Jules, <a href="Gilles%20Peterson">Gilles Peterson</a>, Kissy Sell Out and Fabio & Grooverider. A number of shows were shuffled to incorporate the new line up. On 28 February 2012, further changes were announced. Greg James and Scott Mills swapped shows and <a href="Jameela%20Jamil">Jameela Jamil</a>, <a href="Gemma%20Cairney">Gemma Cairney</a> and <a href="Danny%20Howard">Danny Howard</a> joined the station. The new line up of DJs for "In New DJs We Trust" was also announced with <a href="B.Traits">B.Traits</a>, Mosca, <a href="Jordan%20Suckley">Jordan Suckley</a> and Julio Bashmore hosting shows on a four weekly rotation. This new schedule took effect on Monday, 2 April 2012.

In September 2012, Nick Grimshaw replaced Chris Moyles as host of "Radio 1's Breakfast Show". Grimshaw previously hosted Mon-Thurs 10pm-Midnight, Weekend Breakfast and Sunday evenings alongside Annie Mac. Grimshaw was replaced by Phil Taggart and Alice Levine on the 10pm-Midnight show.

In November 2012, another series of changes were announced. This included the departure of Reggie Yates and Vernon Kay. Jameela Jamil was announced as the new presenter of "The Official Chart". Matt Edmondson will host a weekend morning show and Tom Deacon will return to present a Wednesday night show. <a href="Dan%20Howell">Dan Howell</a> and <a href="Phil%20Lester">Phil Lester</a>, famous <a href="YouTubers">YouTubers</a> also joined the station. The changes took effect in January 2013.

Former breakfast presenter Sara Cox hosted her last show on Radio 1 in February 2014 before moving to Radio 2. In March 2014, Gemma Cairney left the weekend breakfast show to host the weekday early breakfast slot, swapping shows with Dev.

In September 2014, Radio 1 operated a series of changes to their output which saw many notable presenters leave the station – including Edith Bowman, Nihal and Rob da Bank. Huw Stephens gained a new show hosting 10pm-1am Mon-Wed with Alice Levine presenting weekends 1pm-4pm. Radio 1's Residency also expanded with Skream joining the rotational line-up on Thursday nights 10pm-1am.

From December 2014 to April 2016, Radio 1 included a weekly late night show presented by a well known Internet personality called "The Internet Takeover". Shows have been presented by various YouTubers such as <a href="Jim%20Chapman%20%28Internet%20celebrity%29">Jim Chapman</a> and <a href="Hannah%20Witton">Hannah Witton</a>.

In January 2015, Clara Amfo replaced Jameela Jamil as host of The Official Chart on Sundays (4pm-7pm) and in March, Zane Lowe left Radio 1 and was replaced by Annie Mac on the new music evening show.

In May 2015, <a href="Fearne%20Cotton">Fearne Cotton</a> left the station after almost 10 years. Her weekday morning show was taken over by Clara Amfo. Adele Roberts also joined the weekday schedule line-up, hosting the Early Breakfast show.

In July 2015, The Official Chart moved to a Friday from 4pm-5.45pm, hosted by Greg James. The move took place in order to take into account the changes to the release dates of music globally. Cel Spellman joined Radio 1 to host Sunday evenings 4pm-7pm.

From inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.

In 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from <a href="Broadcasting%20House">Broadcasting House</a> to <a href="Egton%20House">Egton House</a>. The station moved to <a href="Yalding%20House">Yalding House</a> in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House. This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing.

Until recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on <a href="Great%20Portland%20Street">Great Portland Street</a> in <a href="central%20London">central London</a>. They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production). These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the "<a href="Live%20Lounge">Live Lounge</a>", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as <a href="Maida%20Vale%20Studios">Maida Vale Studios</a> is used instead for larger set-ups. The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the "Live Lounge", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows. Y2 is the studio from where "<a href="The%20Chris%20Moyles%20Show">The Chris Moyles Show</a>" was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the "Live Cam". The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House.

In December 2012 Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new <a href="Broadcasting%20House">BBC Broadcasting House</a>, Portland Place, just a few metres away from the "Peel Wing", formerly the "Egton Wing", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the "Peel Wing" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>, who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004.

Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably "The Mark and Lard Show", broadcast every weekday from <a href="New%20Broadcasting%20House%20%28Manchester%29">New Broadcasting House</a>, Oxford Road, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> for over a decade (October 1993 – March 2004) — the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital.

Radio 1 originally broadcast on 1214 kHz <a href="medium%20wave">medium wave</a> (or 247 metres). On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to 1053/1089 kHz (275/285 m), but did not broadcast nationally on its own FM frequencies until late 1987. The BBC was allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then <a href="BBC%20Light%20Programme">Light Programme</a> (now <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">BBC Radio 2</a>), <a href="BBC%20Third%20Programme">Third Programme</a> (now <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>) and <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">Home Service</a> (now <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>) stations. This meant when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM. Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over <a href="BBC%20Radio%202">Radio 2's</a> FM transmitters for a few hours per week – Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening – most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons – 10:00 pm to midnight on weeknights including <a href="Sounds%20of%20the%20Seventies">Sounds of the Seventies</a> until 1975, and thereafter the <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> show (Mon – Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show and most Bank Holiday afternoons when Radio 2 was broadcasting a bank holiday edition of <a href="5%20live%20Sport">Sport on 2</a>.

To coincide with Radio 1's 20th birthday, the first full-time FM broadcast went live in the London area on 31 October 1987, but this was at low power on 104.8 MHz FM. A year later the FM frequencies became national when the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97–99 FM, which the BBC acquired. The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England. A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended. Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995. The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995.

The Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to <a href="Independent%20National%20Radio">Independent National Radio</a>. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with <a href="Stephen%20Duffy">Stephen Duffy</a>'s "Kiss Me" being the last record played on MW just before 9:00 am. For those who continued to listen, just after 9:00 am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with <a href="Mark%20Goodier">Mark Goodier</a> was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an "FM-only" station. Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on <a href="Sky%20Television%20plc">Sky Television's</a> analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on <a href="Gold%20%28UK%20TV%20channel%29">UK Gold</a>) and later in stereo (on <a href="Sky%20Living">UK Living</a>).

The BBC launched its national radio stations on <a href="Digital%20Audio%20Broadcasting">DAB</a> digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies. DAB was "officially" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper. Today it can also be heard on UK digital TV services <a href="Freeview%20%28UK%29">Freeview</a>, <a href="Virgin%20Media">Virgin Media</a>, <a href="Sky%20%28UK%20and%20Ireland%29">Sky</a> and the Internet as well as FM. In July 2005, <a href="Sirius%20Satellite%20Radio">Sirius Satellite Radio</a> began <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>ing Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on <a href="Dish%20Network">Dish Network</a> satellite TV. <a href="Sirius%20Canada">Sirius Canada</a> began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11). The Sirius simulcasts were <a href="Time%20shifting">time shifted</a> five hours to allow U.S. and Canadian listeners in the <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern Time Zone</a> to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners. On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29, moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011. Until the full station was removed in August 2011, Radio 1 was able to be heard by approximately 20.6 million listeners in North America on satellite radio alone.
BBC Radio 1 can be heard on cable in the Netherlands at 105.10 FM.

At 12am on 9 August 2011, <a href="Sirius%20XM%20Radio">Sirius XM</a> ceased carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no prior warning. On 10 August 2011 the BBC issued the following statement:
The BBC’s commercial arm BBC Worldwide has been in partnership with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to broadcast Radio 1 on their main network, since 2005. This agreement has now unfortunately come to an end and BBC Worldwide are in current discussions with the satellite radio station to find ways to continue to bring popular music channel, BBC Radio 1, to the US audience. We will keep you posted.

Thousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM Radio. One week later, Sirius and the BBC agreed on a new carriage agreement that saw Radio 1 broadcast on a time-shifted format on the Sirius XM Internet Radio platform only, on channel 815. The channel is still unavailable on the satellite platform of the service.

Starting on 15 January 2012, "The Official Chart Show" began broadcasting on SiriusXM "20on20" channel 3, at 4pm and 9pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a>.

On 19 August 2014, SiriusXM again stopped carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no advanced notice. The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform.

From 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the <a href="home%20nations">home nations</a> for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent. Most recently, these shows were under the <a href="BBC%20Introducing">BBC Introducing</a> brand. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England.

From January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae. Previously it was hosted by <a href="Vic%20Galloway">Vic Galloway</a> (who also presents for <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Scotland">BBC Radio Scotland</a>); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed.

Wales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012. Previously <a href="Bethan%20Elfyn">Bethan Elfyn</a> occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens, until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales - a Welsh-language music show on <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Cymru">BBC Radio Cymru</a> on Thursday evenings)

Phil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012. The show was formerly presented by <a href="Rory%20McConnell">Rory McConnell</a>. Before joining the national network, <a href="Colin%20Murray">Colin Murray</a> was a presenter on the Session in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge; after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place.

The regional opt-outs originally went out from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm on Thursdays (the Evening Session's time slot) and were known as the Session in the Nations (the 'Session' tag was later dropped due to the demise of the Evening Session); they later moved to run from 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK. On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from 12:00 am to 2:00 am under the "BBC Introducing" banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally. In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of 00:00 to 02:00 on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long.

The opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies. Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised.

The <a href="BBC%20Trust">BBC Trust</a> announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC. In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single "BBC Introducing" show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae.

Because of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a mix of current songs, including <a href="indie%20rock">independent</a>/<a href="alternative%20rock">alternative</a>, <a href="rap">rap</a>, <a href="hip%20hop">hip hop</a>, <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="House%20music">house</a>, <a href="electronica">electronica</a>, <a href="Dance%20music">dance</a>, <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a>, <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a> and <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a>.

Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the "<a href="needle%20time">needle time</a>" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances. Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs. The sessions recorded for <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>'s late night programme are particularly renowned.

The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews. Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity. The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs. While the station is often criticised for "waffling" by presenters, an experimental "more music day" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it.

Radio 1 has a <a href="Public%20service%20broadcasting%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">public service broadcasting</a> obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through <a href="Newsbeat">Newsbeat</a> bulletins throughout the day. Shared with <a href="BBC%20Radio%201Xtra">1Xtra</a>, short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two 15-minute bulletins at 12:45 and 17:45 on weekdays. The main presenter is Chris Smith, with <a href="Tina%20Daheley">Tina Daheley</a> presenting during Radio 1's breakfast hours.

In recent years, Radio 1 has aimed to include more of its content online in order to relate to the changing nature of its audience. Its <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel now has over 3 million subscribers and many features and events are streamed on both that and the Radio 1 website.

The station also has a heavy presence on social media, with audience interaction now occurring mainly through <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> as well as <a href="Short%20Message%20Service">text messaging</a>.

It was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a> where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location. Plans were approved by the <a href="BBC%20Trust">BBC Trust</a> in November 2014 and the channel launched on 10 November 2014.

BBC Radio 1 operates a system that separates all of the DJs between 'Day' and 'Night' DJs.

Weekdays


Weekends
Monday to Thursday

Friday evenings feature 11 hours of dance music.
Saturday evenings include 11 hours of <a href="urban%20music">urban music</a> "1Xtra Takeover" which, since October 2009, has been simulcast entirely on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201Xtra">BBC Radio 1Xtra</a>.
Sunday evenings

The breakfast show has been presented by many famous names over the years. Currently this slot is broadcast between 6:30 am and 10:00 am, Monday to Friday and is hosted by <a href="Nick%20Grimshaw">Nick Grimshaw</a>.

BBC Radio 1's chart show had aired the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> exclusively on Sunday afternoons since the programme began; but this was moved to Fridays in July 2015. Currently broadcasting from 4:00 pm until 5:45 pm, the format, length and starting time have varied over the years. For many years, the show prided itself on playing all 40 singles in the top 40 but this practice ended when <a href="Wes%20Butters">Wes Butters</a> took over as presenter in 2003; then only tracks below number 20 to be played were the new entries. The show took its current format on 10 July 2015, being presented by <a href="Greg%20James">Greg James</a> in his usual drive time slot. Numbers 40 to 26 are quickly overviewed and then the top 25 are played in full.

Radio 1 provides alternative programming on some Bank Holidays. Programmes have included 'The 10 Hour Takeover', a request-based special, in which the DJs on air would encourage listeners to select any available track to play, 'One Hit Wonder Day' and 'The Chart Of The Decade' where the 150 biggest selling singles in the last 10 years were counted down and played in full.

On Sunday 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday. To mark this anniversary Radio 1 hosted a week of special features, including:

On Saturday 30 September 2017, Radio 1 celebrated its 50th birthday. <a href="Tony%20Blackburn">Tony Blackburn</a> recreated the first ever Radio 1 broadcast on <a href="Radio%202">Radio 2</a>, simulcast on <a href="pop-up">pop-up</a> station Radio 1 Vintage, followed by <a href="The%20Radio%201%20Breakfast%20Show">The Radio 1 Breakfast Show</a> celebration, tricast on Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 1 Vintage, presented by Tony Blackburn and Nick Grimshaw, featuring former presenters <a href="Simon%20Mayo">Simon Mayo</a>, <a href="Sara%20Cox">Sara Cox</a> and <a href="Mike%20Read">Mike Read</a> .

Radio 1 regularly supports charities <a href="Comic%20Relief">Comic Relief</a>, <a href="Sport%20Relief">Sport Relief</a> and <a href="Children%20in%20Need">Children in Need</a>.

On 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest serving breakfast DJ <a href="Chris%20Moyles">Chris Moyles</a> and sidekick <a href="Comedy%20Dave">Dave Vitty</a> broadcast for 52 hours as part of a <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> attempt, in aid of <a href="Comic%20Relief">Comic Relief</a>. The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)’ after already breaking <a href="Simon%20Mayo">Simon Mayo</a>'s 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief.

The presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30 am on 18 March 2011. During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over £2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit. After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit. The appearance of Cotton between 10:10 am and 10:30 am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic.

In total the event raised £2,622,421 for Comic Relief.

In 1981, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a> film, "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28radio%29">Star Wars</a>". The 13-episode serial was adapted for radio by the author <a href="Brian%20Daley">Brian Daley</a> and directed by <a href="John%20Madden%20%28director%29">John Madden</a>, and was a <a href="International%20co-production">co-production</a> between the BBC and the American Broadcaster <a href="NPR">NPR</a>.

The <a href="Radio%201%20Roadshow">Radio 1 Roadshow</a>, which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973, hosted by <a href="Alan%20Freeman">Alan Freeman</a> in <a href="Newquay">Newquay</a>, <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, with the final one held at <a href="Heaton%20Park">Heaton Park</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> in 1999. Although the Roadshow attracted large crowds and the style changed with the style of the station itself—such as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 ("2minuteTour")—they were still rooted in the older style of the station, and therefore fit for retirement.

In March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it "One Big Sunday" in the process. Several of these "Sundays" were held in large city-centre parks. In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded "<a href="Radio%201%27s%20Big%20Weekend">One Big Weekend</a>", with each event occurring biannually and covering two days. Under this name, it visited <a href="Derry">Derry</a> in Northern Ireland, as part of the "Music Lives" campaign, and <a href="Perry%20Park%20%28Birmingham%29">Perry Park</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>.

The most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as <a href="Radio%201%27s%20Big%20Weekend">Radio 1's Big Weekend</a>. Venues under this title have included <a href="Herrington">Herrington Country Park</a>, <a href="Camperdown%20Country%20Park">Camperdown Country Park</a>, <a href="Moor%20Park%2C%20Preston">Moor Park</a>–which was the first "Weekend" to feature a third stage–<a href="Mote%20Park">Mote Park</a>, <a href="Lydiard%20Park">Lydiard Park</a>, <a href="Bangor%2C%20Gwynedd">Bangor</a> and <a href="Carlisle%20Lake%20District%20Airport">Carlisle Airport</a>.

Tickets for each "Big Weekend" are given away free of charge, making it the largest free ticketed music festival in Europe.

BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend was replaced by a larger festival in 2012, named 'Radio 1's Hackney Weekend', with a crowd capacity of 100,000. The Hackney Weekend took place over the weekend of 23–24 June 2012 in <a href="Hackney%20Marshes">Hackney Marshes</a>, <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a>, <a href="London">London</a>. The event was to celebrate the <a href="2012%20Cultural%20Olympiad">2012 Cultural Olympiad</a> in London and had artists such as <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> and <a href="Florence%20and%20the%20Machine">Florence and the Machine</a>.

In 2013, Radio 1's Big Weekend returned to <a href="Derry">Derry</a> as part of the City of Culture 2013 celebrations. So far, Derry is the only city to have hosted the Big Weekend twice.

In May 2014, Radio 1's Big Weekend was held in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Acts which played at the event included <a href="Rita%20Ora">Rita Ora</a>, <a href="The%201975">The 1975</a>, <a href="Katy%20Perry">Katy Perry</a>, <a href="Jake%20Bugg">Jake Bugg</a> and <a href="Pharrell%20Williams">Pharrell Williams</a>. The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in <a href="George%20Square">George Square</a>, featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as <a href="Danny%20Howard">Danny Howard</a> and <a href="Pete%20Tong">Pete Tong</a>, and other well-known acts such as <a href="Martin%20Garrix">Martin Garrix</a> and <a href="Ti%C3%ABsto">Tiesto</a>.

BBC Red Button

BBC Red Button is a branding used for digital <a href="interactive%20television">interactive television</a> services provided by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, and broadcast in the United Kingdom. The services replaced <a href="Ceefax">Ceefax</a>, the BBC's analogue <a href="teletext">teletext</a> service. The service can be accessed via <a href="Digital%20terrestrial%20television">Digital terrestrial television</a> (DTT) (<a href="DVB-T">DVB-T</a>), satellite television (<a href="DVB-S">DVB-S</a>) and cable television (<a href="DVB-C">DVB-C</a>).

The service was launched in September 1999 as BBC Text. It was relaunched in November 2001 under the BBCi brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button. The "red button" name refers to the common interface on <a href="remote%20control">remote control</a>s for digital televisions and <a href="set-top%20box">set-top box</a>es, a red <a href="push-button">push-button</a> which launches digital teletext services.

Although initially marketed as a spectacular new form of television, by 2008 this had given way to positioning iTV as ‘everyday’. This was due in part to the institutional landscape of television in the UK.

BBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services in September 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms. In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax. A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes.
BBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour). BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay (i.e. opaque blocks of colour on top of the television channel, with the black background now transparent; not 'translucent blocks of colour with a translucent black background') above the television picture. The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases.

BBC Text pioneered an early form of "<a href="Video%20on%20demand">on-demand</a>" <a href="interactive%20television">interactive television</a>, called Enhanced TV. During the <a href="1999%20Wimbledon%20Championships">1999 Wimbledon Championships</a>, the BBC presented a service which allowed viewers to select a video stream of different matches, and access additional information such as player profiles, scores and interactive quizzes. Although the experimental service was publicly available, there were no digital set-top boxes or receivers available on the market which could decode the signal and the service was only presented to the public via BBC demonstrations using prototype receivers.

The BBCi brand launched in November 2001 and was conceived as a cohesive <a href="cross-platform">multi-platform</a> brand name for all the BBC's digital interactive services, encompassing the corporation's digital teletext, interactive television and website services. According to the BBC, the "i" in BBCi stood for "interactivity" as well as "innovation".

The various services all took on a common interface device, an "i-bar" branded with the BBCi logo, which sought to emphasise the brand across different technologies by providing similar navigation. For example, the <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC website</a>, which had previously been called BBC Online, took on the BBCi brand from 2001, displaying an i-bar across the top of every page, offering a category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index, and a search. Similarly, BBC interactive television services all offered a horizontal i-bar along the bottom of television screens, with four colour-coded interactions linked to the four colour buttons on TV remote controls.

After three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed <a href="BBC%20Online">bbc.co.uk</a>, after the main <a href="Uniform%20resource%20locator">URL</a> used to access the site. Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until late 2008.

Today, the broadcaster's online video player, the <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a>, reflects the branding legacy by retaining an i-prefix in its branding.

From 2008, the BBC gradually began to drop the BBCi name from its digital interactive TV services also, replacing it with the name BBC Red Button. The BBCi logo continued in on-screen presentation for some time.

In November 2008, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service.

BBC Connected Red Button launched in December 2012 on Virgin TiVo and on some Freeview and Freesat 'Smart TVs' in December 2013. The service is a composite IP and broadcast service and may be the future of Red Button on internet connected televisions.

The service was renamed BBC Red Button+ in April 2015. It launched with an updated brand.

BBC Red Button is available on all digital television platforms in the UK, including <a href="digital%20cable">digital cable</a> through <a href="Virgin%20Media">Virgin Media</a>, digital <a href="satellite%20television">satellite</a> through <a href="Sky%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Sky</a> and <a href="Freesat">Freesat</a> and <a href="digital%20terrestrial%20television">digital terrestrial television</a> through <a href="Freeview%20%28UK%29">Freeview</a>. It is also available in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> through <a href="Sky%20Ireland">Sky</a>. On Freeview interactivity does not permit users to submit data (such as answering questions in a quiz or requesting <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a>), as the platform does not provide a <a href="bounce%20address">return path</a>. BBC Red Button currently provides one video stream to all platforms, which can be accessed directly from Freeview channel 601, Freesat channel 981, Sky channel 980 and Virgin Media channel 991, however the feed is standard definition only. One advantage of the feed is the DVR ability as the conventional Red Button interaction restricts DVR record / pause / rewind functions, and is a major caveat for many. It is currently unknown if the BBC plans to re-introduce a permanent high-definition service of the direct channel feed, but until they do, viewers will continue to move to rival satellite services for high-definition broadcasts of live sporting events such as tennis, cycling and snooker. The BBC does have the ability to increase the amount of streams during major events and has done so on numerous occasions, as follows:

Generally, BBC Red Button offers text and video based services, as well as enhanced television programmes which offer extra information, video or quizzes.

In September 2005, BBCi launched an update to the interactivity available from the <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC's Radio</a> channels on Freeview. Originally only Radiotext was available. After the update, users could access information about the programme, schedules, news, sport and weather. From 2005, Freeview users could access the CBBC Extra video stream.

The same team behind the BBC's digital text service also launched the early incarnations of the BBC's Interactive Wimbledon and Interactive Open Golf services in 2000, which were awarded an Interactive <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> that year.

The News Multiscreen was removed from the digital service in October 2009, to make room for future Freeview HD broadcasts.

Here is a table of the contents of the BBC Red Button (Last updated April 2013):-

The service was initially compatible with <a href="ONdigital">ONdigital</a> and <a href="ITV%20Digital">ITV Digital</a> boxes, though loading speeds were slower than newer Freeview boxes.

Page numbers were introduced in 2004 to aid navigation, with 3-digit page numbers matching with those of the analogue Ceefax in 2006. Pages exclusive to digital are given a four digit number.

The <a href="Teletext%20Ltd.">Teletext</a> service from the UK commercial broadcasters had stopped supporting the old boxes in 2005. As of 2010, the ONdigital boxes only load pages 100 and 199 and some interactive services that use channel 301, if any other page is loaded it exits the service.

Usage of these boxes dwindled further as technology developed. They used "original" technology and as such were not upgradable. Following each regional changeover to full digital TV broadcasting, the remaining units are no longer of use, as they do not support the "8K-mode" for DVB-T introduced across the UK as part of the <a href="Digital%20terrestrial%20television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Post-switchover">digital switchover</a>.

Backplane

A backplane (or "backplane system") is a group of <a href="electrical%20connector">electrical connector</a>s in parallel with each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors, forming a <a href="computer%20bus">computer bus</a>. It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete <a href="computer%20system">computer system</a>. Backplanes commonly use a <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>, but <a href="wire-wrap">wire-wrap</a>ped backplanes have also been used in <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a>s and high-reliability applications.

Early microcomputer systems like the <a href="Altair%208800">Altair 8800</a> used a backplane for the processor and <a href="expansion%20card">expansion card</a>s. A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements. A backplane uses plug-in cards for storage and processing.

Backplanes are normally used in preference to cables because of their greater <a href="Reliability%20engineering">reliability</a>. In a cabled system, the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added or removed from the system; this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures. A backplane does not suffer from this problem, so its service life is limited only by the longevity of its connectors. For example, the <a href="DIN%2041612">DIN 41612</a> connectors used in the <a href="VMEbus">VMEbus</a> system can withstand 50 to 500 insertions and removals (called "mating cycles"), depending on their quality. To transmit information, Serial Back-Plane technology uses a <a href="low%20voltage%20differential%20signaling">low voltage differential signaling</a> transmission method for sending information.

In addition, there are bus expansion cables which will extend a computer bus to an external backplane, usually located in an enclosure, to provide more or different slots than the host computer provides. These cable sets have a transmitter board located in the computer, an expansion board in the remote backplane, and a cable between the two.

Backplanes have grown in complexity from the simple <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">Industry Standard Architecture</a> (ISA) (used in the original <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>) or <a href="S-100%20bus">S-100</a> style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus. Due to limitations inherent in the <a href="Peripheral%20Component%20Interconnect">Peripheral Component Interconnect</a> (PCI) specification for driving slots, backplanes are now offered as passive and active.

True passive backplanes offer no active bus driving circuitry. Any desired arbitration logic is placed on the daughter cards. Active backplanes include chips which <a href="Buffer%20%28computer%20science%29">buffer</a> the various signals to the slots.

The distinction between the two isn't always clear, but may become an important issue if a whole system is expected to not have a <a href="single%20point%20of%20failure">single point of failure</a> (SPOF). A passive backplane, even if it "is" single, is not usually considered a SPOF. Active backplanes are more complicated and thus have a non-zero risk of malfunction.

When a backplane is used with a plug-in <a href="single%20board%20computer">single board computer</a> (SBC) or <a href="System%20Host%20Board">system host board</a> (SHB), the combination provides the same functionality as a <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a>, providing processing power, memory, I/O and slots for plug-in cards. While there are a few motherboards that offer more than 8 slots, that is the traditional limit. In addition, as technology progresses, the availability and number of a particular slot type may be limited in terms of what is currently offered by motherboard manufacturers.

However, backplane architecture is somewhat unrelated to the SBC technology plugged into it. There are some limitations to what can be constructed, in that the SBC chip set and processor have to provide the capability of supporting the slot types. In addition, virtually an unlimited number of slots can be provided with 20, including the SBC slot, as a practical though not an absolute limit. Thus, a PICMG backplane can provide any number and any mix of ISA, PCI, PCI-X, and PCI-e slots, limited only by the ability of the SBC to interface to and drive those slots. For example, an SBC with the latest i7 processor could interface with a backplane providing up to 19 ISA slots to drive legacy I/O cards.

Some backplanes are constructed with slots for connecting to devices on both sides, and are referred to as midplanes. This ability to plug cards into either side of a midplane is often useful in larger systems made up primarily of modules attached to the midplane.

Midplanes are often used in computers, mostly in <a href="blade%20server">blade server</a>s, where server blades reside on one side and the peripheral (power, networking, and other I/O) and service modules reside on the other.
Midplanes are also popular in networking and telecommunications equipment where one side of the chassis accepts system processing cards and the other side of the chassis accepts network interface cards.

Orthogonal midplanes connect vertical cards on one side to horizontal boards on the other side.
One common orthogonal midplane connects many vertical telephone <a href="line%20card">line card</a>s on one side, each one connected to copper telephone wires, to a horizontal communications card on the other side.

A "virtual midplane" is an imaginary plane between vertical cards on one side that directly connect to horizontal boards on the other side; the card-slot aligners of the card cage and self-aligning connectors on the cards hold the cards in position.

Some people use the term "midplane" to describe a board that sits between and connects a hard drive hot-swap backplane and redundant power supplies.

Servers commonly have a backplane to attach hot swappable hard drives; backplane pins pass directly into hard drive sockets without cables. They may have single connector to connect one <a href="disk%20array%20controller">disk array controller</a> or multiple connectors that can be connected to one or more controllers in arbitrary way. Backplanes are commonly found in <a href="disk%20enclosure">disk enclosure</a>s, <a href="disk%20array">disk array</a>s, and <a href="Server%20%28computing%29">server</a>s.

Backplanes for SAS and SATA HDDs most commonly use the <a href="SGPIO">SGPIO</a> protocol as means of communication between the <a href="host%20adapter">host adapter</a> and the backplane. Alternatively <a href="SCSI%20Enclosure%20Services">SCSI Enclosure Services</a> can be used. With <a href="Parallel%20SCSI">Parallel SCSI</a> subsystems, <a href="SAF-TE">SAF-TE</a> is used.

A single-board computer meeting the PICMG 1.3 specification and compatible with a PICMG 1.3 backplane is referred to as a <a href="system%20host%20board">system host board</a>.

In the Intel Single Board Computer world, <a href="PICMG">PICMG</a> provides standards for the backplane interface:
<a href="PICMG%201.0">PICMG 1.0</a>, 1.1 and 1.2 provide ISA and PCI support, with 1.2 adding PCIX support.
PICMG 1.3 provides PCI-Express support.

Baldric

A baldric (also baldrick, bawdrick, bauldrick as well as other rare or obsolete variations) is a <a href="belt%20%28clothing%29">belt</a> worn over one shoulder that is typically used to carry a weapon (usually a <a href="sword">sword</a>) or other implement such as a <a href="bugle%20%28instrument%29">bugle</a> or <a href="drum">drum</a>. The word may also refer to any belt in general, but this usage is poetic or archaic.

Baldrics have been used since ancient times, usually as part of <a href="military%20dress">military dress</a>. The early Islamic Arabs wore baldrics with their armor. The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and while allowing easy access to the object carried. For example, the late 18th-century British Army's distinctive "<a href="Red%20coat%20%28British%20army%29">Red coat</a>" uniform pattern featured a pair of white baldrics crossed at the chest, with a soldier's <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> sheath suspended from one and his <a href="canteen%20%28bottle%29">canteen</a> suspended from the other. Alternatively, and especially in modern times, the baldric may fill a ceremonial role rather than a practical one.

During <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Roman times</a> the balteus (plural "baltei") was a type of baldric commonly used to suspend a <a href="gladius">sword</a>. It was a belt generally worn over the shoulder, passing obliquely down to the side, typically made of leather, often ornamented with precious stones, metals or both. There was also a similar belt worn by the Romans, particularly by soldiers, called a "cintus" (pl. "cinti") that fastened around the waist. The word "accintus" meaning a soldier (literally, "girt" as for battle) attests to this differing usage.

Many non-military or paramilitary organisations include baldrics as part of ceremonial dress. The <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> 4th Degree Colour Corps uses a baldric as part of their uniform; it supports a ceremonial sword.

The University of Illinois Marching Illini wore two baldrics as a part of their uniform until 2009, with one over each shoulder. They crossed in the front and back and were buttoned onto the jacket beneath a cape and epaulets. Today, the current Marching Illini wears one baldric with two sides: ILLINI is on one side and the traditional orange and white baldric from the previous uniform.

A crossed pair of baldrics is often worn as part of uniform of <a href="Morris%20dance">Morris dance</a> sides; different colours of baldric help to distinguish different sides.

The baldric appears in the literary canon. Britomart, in <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>'s <a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">Faerie Queene</a>, clothes herself in a borrowed armour "with brave bauldrick garnished" before embarking on her quest (pageRank.Book III, canto iii). Benedick, from <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Much%20Ado%20About%20Nothing">Much Ado About Nothing</a>", says "But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldric all women shall pardon me." A baldric features prominently in Chapter 4 of <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>'s "<a href="The%20Three%20Musketeers">The Three Musketeers</a>". The yeoman in <a href="Chaucer">Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="Canterbury%20Tales">Canterbury Tales</a> "is described as wearing a "baldrick of bright green." The baldric of <a href="Pallas%20%28son%20of%20Evander%29">Pallas</a> plays a key part in the <a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>, leading Aeneas to kill Turnus. In "<a href="The%20Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring">The Fellowship of the Ring</a>", <a href="Boromir">Boromir</a> is described: "On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees." In <a href="Sir%20Gawain%20and%20the%20Green%20Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a> Gawain returns from his battle with the Green Knight wearing the green girdle "obliquely, like a baldric, bound at his side,/ below his left shoulder, laced in a knot, in betokening the blame he had borne for his fault."

Some <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>s wear baldrics in "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", such as <a href="Kor%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Kor</a>, <a href="Koloth">Koloth</a>, <a href="Kang%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Kang</a> or <a href="Worf">Worf</a> although sometimes they are referred to as a <a href="sash">sash</a>. The character Worf does so in almost every one of his appearances through two series and four films. In "" episode "", Worf, due to amnesia, mistakenly believes that the baldric indicates his rank or authority, so he briefly assumes command of the Enterprise.

<a href="Baldrick">Baldrick</a> is a character in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> comedy series "<a href="Blackadder">Blackadder</a> "played by <a href="Tony%20Robinson">Tony Robinson</a>.

A baldrick is also mentioned in the epic poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson; <a href="http%3A//www.bbc.co.uk/poetryseason/poems/the_lady_of_shalott.shtml">The Lady of Shallot</a>; in the tenth stanza:

Battle of Waterloo

The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Belgium">Waterloo</a> in present-day <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, then part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">United Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>. A <a href="Army%20of%20the%20North%20%28France%29">French army</a> under the command of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> was defeated by two of the armies of the <a href="Seventh%20Coalition">Seventh Coalition</a>: a <a href="British%20Army">British</a>-led Allied army under the command of the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a>, and a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n army under the command of <a href="Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, Prince of Wahlstatt</a>.

Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition, and began to mobilize armies. Wellington and Blücher's armies were <a href="canton%20%28military%29">cantoned</a> close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a co-ordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ligny">Battle of Ligny</a> with his main force, while at the same time a portion of the French army attacked an Allied army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras</a>. Despite holding his ground at Quatre Bras, the defeat of the Prussians forced Wellington to withdraw to <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Belgium">Waterloo</a>. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, who had . This resulted in the separate and simultaneous <a href="Battle%20of%20Wavre">Battle of Wavre</a> with the Prussian rear-guard.

Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the <a href="Mont-Saint-Jean%2C%20Belgium">Mont-Saint-Jean</a> <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a>, across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.

Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the <a href="Waterloo%20Campaign">Waterloo Campaign</a> and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was "the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life". <a href="Abdication%20of%20Napoleon%2C%201815">Napoleon abdicated</a> four days later, and on 7 July coalition forces entered Paris. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as <a href="Emperor%20of%20the%20French">Emperor of the French</a>, and marked the end of his <a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a> return from exile. This ended the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>, and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace.

The battlefield is located in the municipalities of <a href="Braine-l%27Alleud">Braine-l'Alleud</a> and <a href="Lasne">Lasne</a>, about south of <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, and about from the town of <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Belgium">Waterloo</a>. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by a large monument, the <a href="Lion%27s%20Mound">Lion's Mound</a>. As this mound was constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, the contemporary topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.

On 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a> . Four days later, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon. Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the <a href="Seventh%20Coalition">Seventh Coalition</a> from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised.

Had Napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might have been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians.

An additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> had been sent to North America to fight in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Wellington's initial dispositions were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through <a href="Mons">Mons</a> to the south-west of Brussels. This would have pushed Wellington closer to Blücher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a>. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.

By June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers. Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by <a href="Michel%20Ney">Marshal Ney</a>, a right wing commanded by <a href="Emmanuel%2C%20marquis%20de%20Grouchy">Marshal Grouchy</a> and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> before dawn on 15 June, the French , securing Napoleon's "central position" between Wellington's and Blücher's armies. He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's.

Only very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the <a href="Duchess%20of%20Richmond%27s%20ball">Duchess of Richmond's ball</a> in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the <a href="William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince of Orange</a> and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on <a href="Quatre%20Bras">Quatre Bras</a>, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of <a href="Bernhard%20Carl%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar</a>, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.

Ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of <a href="Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras">Quatre Bras</a> lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.

Meanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ligny">Battle of Ligny</a> using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French. The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.

Crucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Freiherr%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Bülow's</a> IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of <a href="Wavre">Wavre</a>.

With the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable. The next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had <a href="reconnaissance">reconnoitred</a> the previous year—the low <a href="ridge">ridge</a> of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Belgium">Waterloo</a> and the <a href="Sonian%20Forest">Sonian Forest</a>.

Napoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry <a href="action%20at%20Genappe">action at Genappe</a>, there was no substantial engagement.

Before leaving Ligny, Napoleon had ordered Grouchy, who commanded the right wing, to with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy.

As the 17th of June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around to the east of the city. Early on the morning of the 18th, Wellington received an assurance from Blücher that the Prussian army would support him. He decided to hold his ground and give battle.

Three armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's "Armée du Nord", a multinational army under Wellington, and a Prussian army under Blücher.
The French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns. Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured <a href="heavy%20cavalry">heavy cavalry</a>, and seven of highly versatile <a href="lancers">lancers</a> who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.

However as the army took shape, French officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust. Crucially, some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given.

The French army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open. Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon.

Wellington later said that he had "an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff". His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a> (KGL). All of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> veterans. In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hanover">Hanover</a>, 6,000 from <a href="Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg%23Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Brunswick</a>, and 3,000 from <a href="Nassau%20%28duchy%29">Nassau</a>.

Many of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced. The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and "foreign" troops did not prove significant under fire.

Wellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The <a href="Prince%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany">Duke of York</a> imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the <a href="Henry%20Paget%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Anglesey">Earl of Uxbridge</a>. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had <a href="Blank%20cheque">carte blanche</a> from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at <a href="Halle%2C%20Belgium">Halle</a>, away to the west. They were not recalled to participate in the battle but were to serve as a fallback position should the battle be lost. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under <a href="William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince of Orange's</a> younger brother <a href="Prince%20Frederick%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince Frederick of the Netherlands</a>. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.

The Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and "Freikorps" volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many "<a href="Landwehr">Landwehr</a>" (militia) regiments. The "Landwehr" were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state. Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance – guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.

Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its <a href="German%20General%20Staff">General Staff</a> organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours notice.

After Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours. Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under Bülow, commander of IV Corps, attacked <a href="Georges%20Mouton">Lobau</a> at 16:30, while <a href="Hans%20Ernst%20Karl%20von%20Zieten">Zieten's</a> I Corps and parts of <a href="Pirch%20I">Pirch I's</a> II Corps engaged at about 18:00.

The Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the <a href="Ohain%2C%20Belgium">Ohain</a> road, a deep <a href="sunken%20lane">sunken lane</a>. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was <a href="Waterloo%20Elm">a large elm tree</a> that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.

Using the <a href="Reverse%20slope%20defence">reverse slope</a>, as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his <a href="skirmisher">skirmisher</a>s and artillery. The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at . This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of <a href="Braine-l%27Alleud">Braine-l'Alleud</a>, in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.
In front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of <a href="Hougoumont%20%28farmhouse%29">Hougoumont</a>. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as "the hollow-way") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of <a href="Papelotte">Papelotte</a>.

Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's <a href="Flanking%20maneuver">flanks</a> securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of <a href="La%20Haye%20Sainte">La Haye Sainte</a>, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a>. On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the <a href="95th%20Rifles">95th Rifles</a> were posted as sharpshooters.

Wellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfilading fire</a> from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the <a href="List%20of%20Waterloo%20Battlefield%20locations%23Eastern%20end%20of%20the%20line%20of%20battle">other garrisoned buildings</a> on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain <a href="defile%20%28geography%29">defile</a>.

The French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Drouet%2C%20Comte%20d%27Erlon">d'Erlon</a> with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Charles%20Reille">Reille</a> with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn "<a href="La%20Belle%20Alliance">La Belle Alliance</a>" were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the <a href="Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29">Imperial Guard</a>, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.

In the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of <a href="Plancenoit">Plancenoit</a>, and at the extreme right, the "Bois de Paris" wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near "La Belle Alliance" early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.

Wellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, <a href="August%20Neidhardt%20von%20Gneisenau">August Neidhardt von Gneisenau</a>, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.

From 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ligny">Battle of Ligny</a>. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88 artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.

Napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at "Le Caillou", the house where he had spent the night. When <a href="Jean-de-Dieu%20Soult">Soult</a> suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, "Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast".

Napoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim "in war, morale is everything". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.

Later on, being told by his brother, <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Bonaparte">Jerome</a>, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at "Le Caillou" had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.
Napoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had <a href="bivouac%20shelter">bivouacked</a> well to the south of "La Belle Alliance". At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to "head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]" and then "push before him" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo "as soon as possible".

At 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A "<a href="Grand%20Battery">grande batterie</a>" of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.

The historian Andrew Roberts notes that "It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began". Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at "about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont". Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30. The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of <a href="Foot%20Guards">Guards</a>, and the wood and park by Hanoverian "<a href="J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29">Jäger</a>" and the 1/2nd Nassau.

The initial attack by Bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard. The <a href="Coldstream%20Guards">Coldstream Guards</a> and <a href="Scots%20Guards">the Scots Guards</a> arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.
Fighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the <a href="71st%20%28Highland%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">71st Highlanders</a>, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by <a href="Hugh%20Halkett">Hugh Halkett's</a> 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.

The fighting at Hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead. In fact there is a good case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33 battalions in all, 14,000 troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21 battalions (12,000 troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that "the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont".

The 80 guns of Napoleon's "grande batterie" drew up in the centre. These opened fire at 11:50, according to <a href="Rowland%20Hill%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hill">Lord Hill</a> (commander of the Anglo-allied II Corps), while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30. The "grande batterie" was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of Kempt and Pack, and <a href="Hendrik%20George%20de%20Perponcher%20Sedlnitsky">Perponcher's</a> 2nd Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic "<a href="reverse%20slope%20defence">reverse slope defence</a>").
Nevertheless, the bombardment caused a large number of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.

At about 13:00, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of <a href="Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert">Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert</a>, four or five miles (six to eight kilometres) away from his right flank—about three hours march for an army. Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians. Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians "with your sword against his back" towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo. Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Maurice%20G%C3%A9rard">Gérard</a>, to "march to the sound of the guns", but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of <a href="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Baron">Baron</a> <a href="Johann%20von%20Thielmann">Johann von Thielmann</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wavre">Battle of Wavre</a>. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bülow would not actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00.

A little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began in large <a href="column%20%28formation%29">columns</a>. Bernard Cornwell writes "[column] suggests an elongated formation with its narrow end aimed like a spear at the enemy line, while in truth it was much more like a brick advancing sideways and d'Erlon's assault was made up of four such bricks, each one a division of French infantry". Each division, with one exception, was drawn up in huge masses, consisting of the eight or nine battalions of which they were formed, deployed, and placed in a column one behind the other, with only five paces interval between the battalions.

The one exception was the 1st Division (Commanded by <a href="Joachim%20J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Quiot%20du%20Passage">Quiot</a>, the leader of the 1st Brigade). Its two brigades were formed in a similar manner, but side by side instead of behind one another. This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other (<a href="Baron%20Charles-Francois%20Bourgeois">Bourgeois'</a>) was to attack the eastern side of the same post.

The divisions were to advance in <a href="echelon%20%28formation%29">echelon</a> from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart — the 2nd Division (<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Xavier%20Donzelot">Donzelot's</a>) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division (<a href="Pierre-Louis%20Binet%20de%20Marcognet">Marcognet's</a>) next, and the 4th Division (<a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Joseph%20Durutte">Durutte's</a>) on the right.They were led by Ney to the assault, each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred <a href="File%20%28formation%29">files</a>.

The leftmost division, advanced on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was defended by the <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a>. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of <a href="cuirassiers">cuirassiers</a>, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.

At about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000 men over a front of about , against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000 men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st "<a href="Brigade%20van%20Bylandt">Brigade van Bylandt</a>" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Picton">Sir Thomas Picton</a>, who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.

At the moment these skirmishers were rejoining their parent battalions, the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire. On the left of the brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a "few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred". The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap. D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the command of Colonel <a href="Pieter%20Hendrik%20van%20Zuylen%20van%20Nijevelt">Van Zuylen van Nijevelt</a>. A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later. Bylandt was wounded and retired off the field, passing command of the brigade to Lt. Kol. De Jongh.

D'Erlon's men ascended the slope and advanced on the sunken road, "Chemin d'Ohain", that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with <a href="Willem%20Frederik%20van%20Bylandt">Bylandt's</a> brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Xavier%20Donzelot">Donzelot's</a> division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the "45e Régiment de Ligne" and followed by the "25e Régiment de Ligne", somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the "21e" and "45e" regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was <a href="Denis%20Pack">Pack's</a> 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the <a href="Royal%20Scots">Royal Scots</a>, the 42nd <a href="Black%20Watch">Black Watch</a>, the 92nd Gordons and the <a href="44th%20Foot">44th Foot</a> totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.

The French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French "45e Ligne" burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.

Reports from <a href="Karl%20Freiherr%20von%20M%C3%BCffling">Baron von Muffling</a>, the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: "After 3 o’clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon".

At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry. The <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Brigade</a>, known as the Household Brigade, commanded by Major-General <a href="Lord%20Edward%20Somerset">Lord Edward Somerset</a>, consisted of guards regiments: the <a href="1st%20Regiment%20of%20Life%20Guards">1st</a> and <a href="2nd%20Regiment%20of%20Life%20Guards">2nd Life Guards</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a> (the Blues), and the <a href="1st%20King%27s%20Dragoon%20Guards">1st (King's) Dragoon Guards</a>. The <a href="2nd%20Cavalry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Brigade</a>, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General <a href="William%20Ponsonby%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Sir William Ponsonby</a>, was so called as it consisted of an English, the <a href="1st%20The%20Royal%20Dragoons">1st (The Royals)</a>; a Scottish, <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Greys">2nd ('Scots Greys')</a>; and an Irish, <a href="6th%20%28Inniskilling%29%20Dragoons">6th (Inniskilling)</a>; regiment of heavy dragoons.

More than 20 years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm. British cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry some units had scant experience of warfare. The Scots Greys, for example, had not been in action since 1795. According to Wellington, though they were superior individual horsemen, they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability. "I considered one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers".

The two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve. There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, the morning of the battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to "support movements to their front". It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of <a href="Sir%20John%20Ormsby%20Vandeleur">Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur</a>, <a href="Hussey%20Vivian%2C%201st%20Baron%20Vivian">Hussey Vivian</a> and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies. Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying "I committed a great mistake", when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support.

The Household Brigade crossed the crest of the Allied position and charged downhill. The <a href="cuirassiers">cuirassiers</a> guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.

Continuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in <a href="infantry%20square">squares</a>.

To their left, the Union Brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend that some of the <a href="92nd%20%28Gordon%20Highlanders%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">92nd Gordon Highland Regiment</a> clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge. From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th "Ligne". The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th "Ligne", as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th "Ligne" and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade. These would be the only two <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">French eagles</a> captured by the British during the battle. On Wellington's extreme left, <a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Joseph%20Durutte">Durutte's</a> division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.

As with the Household Cavalry, the officers of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.

Napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two <a href="Chevau-l%C3%A9ger">Chevau-léger</a> (lancer) regiments in the I Corps <a href="light%20cavalry">light cavalry</a> division. Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and <a href="La%20Belle%20Alliance">La Belle Alliance</a>, the Scots Greys and the rest of the British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of <a href="%C3%89douard%20Jean%20Baptiste%20Milhaud">Milhaud's</a> <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a>s, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.

As Ponsonby tried to rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was attacked by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue. By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry. A countercharge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch–Belgian light dragoons and <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s under Major-General <a href="Charles%20%C3%89tienne%20de%20Ghigny">Ghigny</a> on the left wing, and Dutch–Belgian "<a href="carabinier">carabinier</a>s" under Major-General Trip in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.

All figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates, as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole. Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest. The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties. On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses.

Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, assert that the British heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades). This service was rendered at a very high cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only 3 squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process. At the end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.

14,000 French troops of D'Erlon's I Corps had been committed to this attack. The I Corps had been driven in rout back across the valley costing Napoleon 3,000 casualties including over 2,000 prisoners taken. Also some valuable time was lost, the charge had dispersed numerous units and it would take until 16:00 hours for D'Erlon's shaken corps to reform. And although elements of the Prussians now began to appear on the field to his right, Napoleon had already ordered Lobau's VI corps to move to the right flank to hold them back before D'Erlon's attack began.

A little before 16:00, Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.
Initially <a href="%C3%89douard%20Jean%20Baptiste%20Milhaud">Milhaud's</a> reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and <a href="Charles%2C%20comte%20Lefebvre-Desnouettes">Lefebvre-Desnoëttes'</a> light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800 sabres, were committed. When these were repulsed, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20%C3%89tienne%20de%20Kellermann">Kellermann's</a> heavy cavalry corps and <a href="Claude-%C3%89tienne%20Guyot">Guyot's</a> heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000 cavalry in 67 squadrons. When Napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon.

Wellington's infantry responded by forming <a href="infantry%20square">squares</a> (hollow box-formations four ranks deep). Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle – a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.

Witnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12 assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite "<a href="Carabiniers-%C3%A0-Cheval">carabinier</a>" brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.

A British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:

In essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. <a href="Cavali%C3%A9%20Mercer">Captain Mercer</a>, who commanded <a href="G%20Parachute%20Battery%20%28Mercer%27s%20Troop%29%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">'G' Troop</a>, <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a>, thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.

For reasons that remain unclear, no attempt was made to <a href="Touch%20hole">spike</a> other allied guns while they were in French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent. Their casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed – testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front. Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the "Grenadiers à Cheval" numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period. Overall Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47% of its strength.

Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500 infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.

Uxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General <a href="Albert%20Dominicus%20Trip%20van%20Zoudtlandt">Trip</a>, to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him. Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence. However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources. Meanwhile, Bachelu's and Tissot's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by fire from artillery and from Adam's infantry brigade, and they eventually fell back. Although the French cavalry caused few direct casualties to Wellington's centre, artillery fire onto his infantry squares caused many. Wellington's cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, and had taken significant losses. The situation appeared so desperate that the Cumberland Hussars, the only Hanoverian cavalry regiment present, fled the field spreading alarm all the way to Brussels.

At approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th "Légère," renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.

With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney then moved skirmishers and <a href="horse%20artillery">horse artillery</a> up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with <a href="canister%20shot">canister</a>. The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square.

The success Napoleon needed to continue his offensive had occurred. Ney was on the verge of breaking the Allied centre.

Along with this artillery fire a multitude of French "tirailleurs" occupied the dominant positions behind La Haye Sainte and poured an effective fire into the squares. The situation was now so dire that the 33rd Regiment's colours and all of Halkett's brigade's colours were sent to the rear for safety, described by historian Alessandro Barbero as, "... a measure that was without precedent". Wellington, noticing the slackening of fire from La Haye Sainte, with his staff rode closer to it. French skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the British command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road. Alten ordered a single battalion, the Fifth KGL to recapture the farm. Their Colonel Ompteda obeyed and chased off some French skirmishers until French cuirassiers fell on his open flank, killed him, destroyed his battalion and took its colour. A Dutch–Belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge, retreated from the field instead, fired on by their own infantry. Merlen's Light Cavalry Brigade charged the French artillery taking position near La Haye Sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart. The Netherlands Cavalry Division, Wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the centre having lost half their strength was now useless and the French cavalry, despite its losses, were masters of the field compelling the allied infantry to remain in square. More and more French artillery was brought forward.

A French battery advanced to within 300 yards of the 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers . Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, "The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped".

French "tirailleurs" occupied the dominant positions, especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry because of the presence of French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the "tirailleurs". That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.

During this time many of Wellington's generals and aides were killed or wounded including Somerset, Canning, de Lancey, Alten and Cooke. The situation was now critical and Wellington, trapped in an infantry square and ignorant of events beyond it, was desperate for the arrival of help from the Prussians. He later wrote, 

The first Prussian corps to arrive in strength was Bülow's IV Corps. Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teaux%20Frichermont">Châteaux Frichermont</a> using the Bois de Paris road. Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack. General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.

At about this time, the 15th Brigade IV Corps was sent to link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-<a href="La%20Haye%2C%20Lasne">La Haie</a> area, with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past the rear of the "Armee Du Nord's" right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.

Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed. The Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out. Napoleon sent two battalions of the Middle/Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting—they did not deign to fire their muskets—this force recaptured the village.

Throughout the late afternoon, Zieten's I Corps had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of La Haie. General Müffling, Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet I Corps.

Zieten had by this time brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid.

Müffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank. Müffling warned Zieten that "The battle is lost if the corps does not keep on the move and immediately support the English army". Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.

The French were expecting Grouchy to march to their support from Wavre, and when Zieten's I Corps appeared at Waterloo instead of Grouchy, "the shock of disillusionment shattered French morale" and "the sight of Zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in Napoleon's army". I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30 the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape. The ends of the line were now based on Hougoumont on the left, Plancenoit on the right, and the centre on La Haie. Durutte had taken the positions of La Haie and Papelotte in a series of attacks, but now retreated behind Smohain without opposing the Prussian 24th Regiment as it retook both. The 24th advanced against the new French position, was repulsed, and returned to the attack supported by Silesian "Schützen" (riflemen) and the F/1st "Landwehr". The French initially fell back before the renewed assault, but now began seriously to contest ground, attempting to regain Smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of Papelotte.

The 24th Regiment linked up with a Highlander battalion on its far right and along with the 13th "Landwehr" regiment and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions. Further attacks by the 13th "Landwehr" and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont. Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield. The soldiers of D’Erlon's Corps alongside this attack on Durutte's division also broke and fled in panic, while to the west the French Middle Guard were assaulting Wellington's centre. The Prussian I Corps then advanced towards the Brussels road and the only line of retreat available to the French.

Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed by the fall of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard. Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the allied line.

Napoleon himself oversaw the initial deployment of the Middle and Old Guard. The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals <a href="Louis%20Friant">Friant</a> and <a href="Paul-Jean-Baptiste%20Poret%20de%20Morvan">Poret de Morvan</a>, on the right along the road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading the square of the 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General <a href="Claude-Etienne%20Michel">Michel</a>, next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion. Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance. Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault, however Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabbé to order Ney to adjust, but Crabbé was unable to get there in time.

Other troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'Érlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the allied line. Of these, Pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.

It was at this moment that the timely arrival of the Dutch General <a href="David%20Hendrik%20Chass%C3%A9">Chassé</a> turned the tide in favour of the Anglo-allied army.Chassé's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain <a href="Carel%20Frederik%20Krahmer%20de%20Bichin">Krahmer de Bichin</a>. The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank. This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (Colonel <a href="Hendrik%20Detmers">Hendrik Detmers</a>) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke. The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired.

To the left of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had suffered more from artillery fire than the grenadiers. But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under <a href="Peregrine%20Maitland">Maitland</a> who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the <a href="52nd%20%28Oxfordshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">52nd Light Infantry</a>, led by <a href="John%20Colborne">John Colborne</a>, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd. The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.

The last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: ""La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut"!" ("The Guard is retreating. Every man for himself!") Wellington now stood up in <a href="Copenhagen%20%28horse%29">Copenhagen's</a> stirrups and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating French. 

The surviving Imperial Guard rallied on their three reserve battalions (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte for a <a href="last%20stand">last stand</a>. A charge from <a href="Frederick%20Adam">Adam's</a> Brigade and the Hanoverian "Landwehr" Osnabrück Battalion, plus Vivian's and Vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right, threw them into confusion. Those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards "La Belle Alliance". It was during this retreat that some of the Guards were invited to surrender, eliciting the famous, if apocryphal, retort ""La Garde meurt, elle ne se rend pas!"" ("The Guard dies, it does not surrender!")

At about the same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were starting to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day. The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard—the French centre of resistance—had corpses strewn about "as if by a whirlwind". Five Guard battalions were deployed in support of the Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps. The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south. Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods.

The 25th Regiment's musketeer battalions threw the 1/2e Grenadiers (Old Guard) out of the Chantelet woods, outflanking Plancenoit and forcing a retreat. The Old Guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic, and became part of that rout. The Prussian IV Corps advanced beyond Plancenoit to find masses of French retreating in disorder from British pursuit. The Prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting Wellington's units. This was the fifth and final time that Plancenoit changed hands.

French forces not retreating with the Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96 per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.

The French right, left, and centre had all now failed. The last cohesive French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around "La Belle Alliance"; they had been so placed to act as a final reserve and to protect Napoleon in the event of a French retreat. He hoped to rally the French army behind them, but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of "La Belle Alliance", in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn. Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square, while the Prussians engaged the other.

As dusk fell, both squares withdrew in relatively good order, but the French artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the Prussian and Anglo-allied armies. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops. Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as Genappe before ordering a halt. There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing of <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a>'s "<a href="The%20Prince">The Prince</a>", and diamonds left behind in the rush to escape. These diamonds became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the <a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a> with oak leaves for the feat. By this time 78 guns and 2,000 prisoners had also been taken, including more generals.

Other sources agree that the meeting of the commanders took place near "La Belle Alliance", with this occurring at around 21:00.

Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded and Blücher some 7,000 (810 of which were suffered by just one unit: the 18th Regiment, which served in Bülow's 15th Brigade, had fought at both Frichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33 <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a>es). Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or wounded and included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.

At 10:30 on 19 June General Grouchy, still following his orders, defeated General Thielemann at <a href="Battle%20of%20Wavre">Wavre</a> and withdrew in good order—though at the cost of 33,000 French troops that never reached the Waterloo battlefield. Wellington sent describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815; it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette Extraordinary</a>" on 22 June. Wellington, Blücher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris.

Napoleon announced his <a href="abdication%20of%20Napoleon%20%281815%29">second abdication</a> on 24 June 1815. In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal <a href="Davout">Davout</a>, Napoleon's minister of war, was defeated by Blücher at <a href="Battle%20of%20Issy">Issy</a> on 3 July 1815. Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> was blockading French ports to forestall such a move. He finally surrendered to <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Frederick%20Lewis%20Maitland%20%28Rear%20Admiral%29">Frederick Maitland</a> of <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Ship">HMS</a> "<a href="HMS%20Bellerophon%20%281786%29">Bellerophon</a>" on 15 July. There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; <a href="Longwy">Longwy</a> capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so. <a href="Louis%20XVIII">Louis XVIII</a> was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, where he died in 1821. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281815%29">Treaty of Paris</a> was signed on 20 November 1815.

Maitland's <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">1st Foot Guards</a>, who had defeated the Chasseurs of the <a href="Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29">Guard</a>, were thought to have defeated the Grenadiers, although they had only faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard. They were nevertheless awarded the title of <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins in the style of the Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the <a href="Polish%201st%20Light%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20of%20the%20Imperial%20Guard">Imperial Guard lancers</a>.

Teeth of tens of thousands of dead soldiers were removed by surviving troops, locals or even scavengers who had travelled there from Britain, then used for making denture replacements in Britain and elsewhere.

Waterloo was a decisive battle in more than one sense. Every generation in Europe up to the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the <a href="Concert%20of%20Europe">Concert of Europe</a>, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> of the early 1790s. It also ended the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.

It was followed by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the <a href="Holy%20Alliance">Holy Alliance</a> of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> into a <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> increasingly marked by the political dominance of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. The bicentenary of Waterloo has prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.
General <a href="Antoine-Henri%20Jomini">Antoine-Henri</a>, Baron Jomini, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.

The Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a>, who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:

Wellington himself wrote in back to London: "I should not do justice to my own feelings, or to Marshal Blücher and the Prussian army, if I did not attribute the successful result of this arduous day to the cordial and timely assistance I received from them. The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".

Despite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the "Campaign of 1815" and "Wellington's famous 1842 essay" in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment. Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.

An alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: "Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. …. Blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat". Steele (2014) writes: "Blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blücher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank. Wellington was able to shift to the offensive".

Some portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June "a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field". In 1820, the Netherlands' King <a href="William%20I%20of%20the%20Netherlands">William I</a> ordered the construction of a monument. The <a href="Lion%27s%20Hillock">Lion's Hillock</a>, a giant mound, was constructed here using of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.

The alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.

Other terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels–Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.

Apart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels–Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud–Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a> troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled "L'Aigle blessé" ("The Wounded Eagle"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.

A monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of <a href="Plancenoit">Plancenoit</a> on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The <a href="Guillaume%20Philibert%20Duhesme">Duhesme</a> mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of <a href="Genappe">Genappe</a>.

The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012. He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the <a href="King%27s%20German%20Legion">King's German Legion</a>.

As part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> minted a 2 <a href="Euro">Euro</a> coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested this issue, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo. After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2½ Euros. Legally only valid within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 Euros. A 10 Euro coin, showing Wellington, Blücher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 Euros.

Boomerang

A boomerang is a tool, typically constructed as a flat <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a> that, when thrown, is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight. A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower. It is well known as a weapon used by <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> for hunting.

Boomerangs have been historically used for <a href="Hunting%20in%20Australia">hunting</a>, as well as a sport, and entertainment. They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon, and come in various shapes and sizes.

A boomerang is traditionally a long wooden device, although historically boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones. Modern boomerangs used for sport are often made from thin aircraft plywood, plastics such as <a href="Acrylonitrile%20butadiene%20styrene">ABS</a>, <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a>, <a href="phenolic%20paper">phenolic paper</a>, or even high-tech materials such as <a href="Carbon%20fiber-reinforced%20polymer">carbon fibre-reinforced plastics</a>. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function. Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumblestick, the boomabird and many other less common types.

An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs. Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air man-made flight. A returning boomerang has two or more <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a> wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> forces that curve its path so that it travels in an <a href="Ellipse">elliptical</a> path and returns to its point of origin when thrown correctly. While a <a href="throwing%20stick">throwing stick</a> can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game. Its surfaces therefore are symmetrical and not uneven like the aerofoils which give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight.

The most recognizable type of the boomerang is the returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or shaunies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation. Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten <a href="game%20%28food%29">game</a> birds into flight and into waiting nets. Modern returning boomerangs can be of various shapes or sizes as can be seen in a photo in the "<a href="%23Modern%20use">Modern use</a>" section.

Historical evidence also points to the use of non-returning boomerangs by the Native Americans of California and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, and inhabitants of southern <a href="India">India</a> for killing birds and rabbits. Indeed, some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in <a href="hand%20to%20hand%20combat">hand to hand combat</a> by <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>. Ancient Egyptian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs.

Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons, <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussive musical instruments</a>, battle <a href="Club%20%28weapon%29">clubs</a>, fire-starters, <a href="decoy">decoy</a>s for hunting <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a>, and as recreational play toys. The smallest boomerang may be less than from tip to tip, and the largest over in length. <a href="tribe">Tribal</a> boomerangs may be inscribed and/or painted with designs meaningful to their makers. Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type.

The origin of the term is mostly certain, but many researchers have different theories on how the word entered into the English vocabulary. One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct Aboriginal language of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Australia, but mentions a variant, "wo-mur-rang", which it dates to 1798. The boomerang was first encountered by western people at <a href="Farm%20Cove%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Farm Cove</a> (<a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a>), Australia, in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal <a href="Skirmisher">skirmish</a>:

<a href="David%20Collins%20%28governor%29">David Collins</a> listed "Wo-mur-rāng" as one of eight aboriginal "Names of clubs" in 1798. A 1790 anonymous <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> on <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">aboriginal</a> language of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> reported "Boo-mer-rit" as "the Scimiter".

In 1822, it was described in detail and recorded as a "bou-mar-rang" in the language of the <a href="Turuwal">Turuwal</a> people (a sub-group of the <a href="Darug">Darug</a>) of the <a href="Georges%20River">Georges River</a> near Port Jackson. The Turawal used other words for their hunting sticks but used "boomerang" to refer to a returning <a href="Throwing%20stick">throw-stick</a>. They were also mistakenly referred to as a "woomerang" in confusion with the Aboriginal spear-throwing device called "<a href="woomera%20%28spear-thrower%29">woomera</a>".

Depictions of boomerangs being thrown at animals, such as kangaroos, appear in some of the oldest rock art in the world, the <a href="Indigenous%20Australian%20art">Indigenous Australian rock art</a> of the Kimberly region, which is potentially up to 50,000 years old. Stencils and paintings of boomerangs also appear in the rock art of <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea">West Papua</a>, including on <a href="Bird%27s%20Head%20Peninsula">Bird's Head Peninsula</a> and <a href="Kaimana">Kaimana</a>, likely dating to the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, when lower sea levels led to cultural continuity between Papua and <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a> in Northern Australia. The oldest surviving <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Australian Aboriginal</a> boomerangs come from a cache found in a peat bog in the Wyrie Swamp of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and date to <a href="8th%20millennium%20BC">10,000 BP</a>.

Though traditionally thought of as Australian, boomerangs have been found also in ancient Europe, Egypt, and North America. Hunting sticks discovered in Europe seem to have formed part of the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> arsenal of weapons. One boomerang that was discovered in Jaskinia Obłazowa in the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> in Poland was made of mammoth's tusk and is believed, based on <a href="Accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">AMS dating</a> of objects found with it, to be about 30,000 years old. In the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, boomerangs have been found in <a href="Vlaardingen">Vlaardingen</a> and <a href="Velsen">Velsen</a> from the first century BC. <a href="Tutankhamun">King Tutankhamun</a>, the famous <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> of ancient Egypt, who died over 3,300 years ago, owned a collection of boomerangs of both the straight flying (hunting) and returning variety.

No one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick, still used by the <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Australian Aborigines</a> and other indigenous peoples around the world, including the <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> in North America. A hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one. The curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to "tune" their throwing sticks to fly straight.

Today, boomerangs are mostly used as sporting items. There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; <a href="maximum%20time%20aloft">maximum time aloft</a>; fast catch; and endurance (see below). The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch <a href="plywood">plywood</a>, <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>, plastic or <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s and comes in many different shapes and colours. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than , with MTA boomerangs (boomerangs used for the maximum-time-aloft event) often under .

Boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to <a href="clay%20pigeons">clay pigeons</a> in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target.

The modern boomerang is often <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a>ed with precision airfoils. The number of "wings" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2.

In 1992, German astronaut <a href="Ulf%20Merbold">Ulf Merbold</a> performed an experiment aboard Spacelab that established that boomerangs function in <a href="Weightlessness">zero gravity</a> as they do on Earth. French Astronaut <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Clervoy">Jean-François Clervoy</a> aboard MIR repeated this in 1997. In 2008, Japanese astronaut <a href="Takao%20Doi">Takao Doi</a> again repeated the experiment on board the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

It is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals, or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, or, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower. It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters. In southeastern Australia, it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs. Despite these notions and similar claims by a few European writers, there is no independently contemporaneous record of any aboriginal peoples using a returning boomerang as a weapon.

Traditionally, most boomerangs used by aboriginal groups in Australia were 'non-returning'. These weapons, sometimes called "throwsticks" or "kylies", were used for hunting a variety of prey, from <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s to parrots; at a range of about , a 2-kg (4.4 lb) non-returning boomerang could inflict mortal injury to a large animal. A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck. Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as "beaked kylies", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock. It should be noted that throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together.

A returning boomerang is a rotating wing. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point.

Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a>.

As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, this creates airflow over the wings and this creates lift on both "wings". However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip-speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed. Thus if thrown nearly upright each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom.

While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, gyroscopic effect causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, and this is what curves the flight in such a way that it will tend to return.

Thus <a href="gyroscopic%20precession">gyroscopic precession</a> is what makes the boomerang return to the thrower when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang fly straight up into the air when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a <a href="Flying%20disc">Frisbee</a>, but rather thrown with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost-vertical plane.

Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximise the boomerang's hover-time in descending from the highest point in its flight.

Some boomerangs have <a href="turbulator">turbulator</a>s—bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation).

The pattern is placed on the plywood so that the wood grain runs across from the tip of one end of the boomerang to the tip of the other end. Try to get the grain of the outer ply running at 45 degrees to the length of the arms. If there is any warp in the wood, make sure that this produces dihedral on the upper side of the boomerang, i.e., if the airfoil is uppermost and the boomerang is on a flat surface, then the wingtips are raised slightly above the surface. (Any anhedral and the boomerang won't fly.) The pattern is traced on to the boomerang with a pencil. The boomerang shape is cut out of the plywood. This basic cut out is called the blank. An outline is drawn on the top of the blank to show the areas to be shaped for the leading and trailing edges of the wings. The profiles of the wings are shaped. The top of the leading edge of each wing is decreased at a 45° angle, while the rear of the wing is angled down to leave 1–2 mm thick trailing edge. The bottom face of the leading edge is trimmed back slightly. The tips of the wings are shaped down to the same thickness as the trailing edge. The various layers of the plywood serve as an outline that helps the worker achieve equal slopes. A shallow section may also be cut out from the bottom surface of each wing. For example, this might consist of a 5-cm long strip near the wing tip and behind the leading edge. Using progressively finer sandpaper, the surface of the boomerang is smoothed carefully. Check the boomerang for a slight amount of dihedral (2–3 mm) on both wings at this point. If there isn't any, introduce some by heating the boomerang either over a heat source or a brief spell in the microwave oven (about 30 seconds on high) – if the boomerang is just about uncomfortably hot to handle, you've got it just about right. Bend up the tips of the wings and place the boomerang on a flat surface with a coin under each tip and a weight (bag of sugar?) on the elbow of the boomerang. Allow it to cool for twenty minutes or more. After spraying the surface with sanding sealer, the surface is smoothed with fine steel wool. The boomerang is then painted again.

The boomerang is then thrown several times to check if it works. The extreme subtleties of the <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> forces on the light wooden boomerang make it surprisingly difficult to predict how the finished boomerang will perform. Two apparently identical boomerangs may radically differ in their flight patterns. For example, they may climb uncontrollably, they may fall repeatedly into the ground, they may exhibit long narrow pattern non-returning flight, or display other erratic behaviour. The only sure way to know is to flight-test them. There are several methods to correct problems, for example the wing profiles might be adjusted by additional sanding. Plywood boomerangs may be heated for a short time in a <a href="microwave%20oven">microwave oven</a> which softens the glue between the layers and then can be carefully intentionally warped. <a href="Angle%20of%20attack">Angle of attack</a> of the leading arm and the dingle arm can be adjusted, as can the overall <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a> of the wings all with some effect. There are many other esoteric tuning techniques as well. Tuning boomerangs is more of a slowly learned art than a science. The quality of the boomerang is also checked throughout this process. A tuned boomerang should be stored carefully on a flat surface away from too much humidity, direct sunlight, or heat. These conditions can subtly affect the shape of the boomerang and ruin its flight characteristics, and the boomerang will then need to be re-tuned.

The hunting boomerang is more delicately balanced and is therefore much harder to make than a returning one. When thrown, this type of boomerang needs to develop no unbalanced aerodynamic forces that would affect its flight path, so that it will fly true to the target.

Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs. These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects often do not look like boomerangs at all. The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success. As long as there are somewhere in the object several airfoil contoured surfaces, whether wing shaped or not, these boomerangs can be thrown and will return. Designs are amazingly diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract. Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse.

A right-handed boomerang is thrown with a counter-clockwise spin causing a counter-clockwise flight (as seen from above). Conversely, a left-handed boomerang is constructed as a mirror image with the aerofoils' leading edges on the left side of the wings, as seen from above, causing it to produce lift when circling clockwise. Although appearing symmetrical from a plan view, the leading edges are on opposite edges of the wings (leading and trailing) so as to present the leading edges of the aerofoil to the wind when spinning.
Most sport boomerangs are in the range of about . The range on most is between . Boomerangs are generally thrown in treeless, large open spaces that are twice as large as the range of the boomerang. A right- or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers may find awkward.

The correct launch orientation makes the boomerang's flight begin by flying into the wind, then having its flight take it through the "eye of the wind" and finally returning downwind using the wind's speed to help complete its flight back to the thrower. It is the spin that makes the boomerang return and the strength of throw and spin must be varied according to the speed of the wind – the stronger the wind, the less power is required to provide lift enough to make the return journey. In other words, the stronger the wind, the softer the boomerang is thrown. A light wind of three to five miles per hour is considered ideal. If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it is usually too strong for boomerangs.

Properly thrown boomerang should curve around to the left, climb gently, level out in mid-flight, arc around and descend slowly, and then finish by popping up slightly, hovering, then stalling near the thrower. Ideally, this momentary hovering or stalling will allow the catcher the opportunity to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands.

In international competition, a "world cup" is held every second year. , teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition. The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2016 by Swiss thrower <a href="Manuel%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Manuel Schütz</a>. In 1992, 1998, 2006 and 2008 <a href="Fridolin%20Frost">Fridolin Frost</a> from Germany won the title.

The team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team). World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time. Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian <a href="Alejandro%20Palacio">Alejandro Palacio</a>. In 2016 USA became team world champion. 

Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least from the thrower. Throwing takes place individually. The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field.

Events include:


"Non-discipline record": Smallest Returning Boomerang: Sadir Kattan of Australia in 1997 with long and wide. This tiny boomerang flew the required , before returning to the accuracy circles on 22 March 1997 at the Australian National Championships.

A boomerang was used to set a <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> with a throw of 1,401.5 feet (427.2 metres) by David Schummy on at <a href="Murrarie%20Recreation%20Ground">Murrarie Recreation Ground</a>, Australia. This broke the record set by Erin Hemmings who threw an <a href="Aerobie">Aerobie</a> 1,333 feet (406.3 metres) on 14 July 2003 at <a href="Fort%20Funston">Fort Funston</a>, San Francisco.

Long-distance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point. In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an <a href="infinity">infinite</a> <a href="Vertical%20angles">vertical</a> <a href="extrusion">extrude</a> of a large line centred on the thrower. Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and the thrower is happy whenever he/she does not have to travel after the throw, to recover the boomerang.

Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return. For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline. For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic.

Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an "S" or "? – question mark" shape and have a <a href="bevel">bevel</a>ed edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut). This is to minimise drag and lower the lift. Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat). Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> composites.

The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a <a href="Drop%20%28liquid%29">water drop</a>. For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent. Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half.

From theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its <a href="derivative">derivative</a> crosses 0. Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity. The <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> of the forward component is then stored in the <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a>. This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag).

In <a href="Noongar%20language">Noongar language</a>, "kylie" is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals
"Kylie" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals. Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers. They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent. The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning "boomerang" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the <a href="Warlpiri%20language">Warlpiri</a> word "karli".

Bodybuilding

Bodybuilding is the use of <a href="Weight%20training">progressive resistance exercise</a> to control and develop one's <a href="Muscle">musculature</a>. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. In <a href="professional%20bodybuilding">professional bodybuilding</a>, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.

The winner of the annual <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20BodyBuilders">IFBB</a> <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a> contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder. The title is currently held by <a href="Phil%20Heath">Phil Heath</a>, who has won every year from 2011 to 2017. The winner of the Women's Physique portion of the competition is widely regarded as the world's top female professional bodybuilder. The title is currently held by <a href="Juliana%20Malacarne">Juliana Malacarne</a>, who has won every year since 2014. Since 1950, the <a href="National%20Amateur%20Body-Builders%27%20Association">NABBA</a> <a href="Universe%20Championships">Universe Championships</a> have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as <a href="Reg%20Park">Reg Park</a>, <a href="Lee%20Priest">Lee Priest</a>, <a href="Steve%20Reeves">Steve Reeves</a>, and <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>.

Stone-lifting traditions were practised in ancient <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Tamilakam">Tamilakam</a>. Western weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with <a href="Strongman%20%28strength%20athlete%29">strongmen</a> displaying feats of <a href="Physical%20strength">strength</a> for the public and challenging each other. The focus was not on their physique, and they often had large bellies and fatty limbs.

Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German <a href="Eugen%20Sandow">Eugen Sandow</a>, now called the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding". He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, <a href="Florenz%20Ziegfeld">Florenz Ziegfeld</a>. The <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a>-winning 1936 <a href="musical%20film">musical film</a> "<a href="The%20Great%20Ziegfeld">The Great Ziegfeld</a>" depicts this beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.

Sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined <a href="dumbbell">dumbbell</a>s, spring <a href="pulley">pulley</a>s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in "<a href="cabinet%20card">cabinet card</a>s" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect "gracilian", a standard of <a href="Golden%20ratio">ideal body proportions</a> close to those of ancient Greek and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> statues. Men were judged by how closely they matched these proportions.

Sandow organised the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the "Great Competition". It was held at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy, now the most famous of all, was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe. In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to <a href="Steve%20Reeves">Steve Reeves</a> for winning the inaugural <a href="National%20Amateur%20Body-Builders%27%20Association">NABBA</a> <a href="Universe%20Championships">Mr. Universe</a>. It would not resurface again until 1977, when the winner of the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20BodyBuilders">IFBB</a> <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a> contest, <a href="Frank%20Zane">Frank Zane</a>, was presented with the bronze trophy, or at least a replica of it. Since then, <a href="Mr.%20Olympia">Mr. Olympia</a> winners have been awarded a replica of the bronze trophy.

On January 16, 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The competition was promoted by <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a>, the father of physical culture and publisher of the original bodybuilding magazines such as "Health & Strength". The winner was Al Treloar, who was declared "The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World". Treloar won a <a href="US%20dollar">$</a>1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. Two weeks later, <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before. Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. In the early 20th century, Macfadden and <a href="Charles%20Atlas">Charles Atlas</a> continued to promote bodybuilding across the world. <a href="Alois%20P.%20Swoboda">Alois P. Swoboda</a> was an early pioneer in America.

Many other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include <a href="Earle%20Liederman">Earle Liederman</a> (writer of some of the earliest bodybuilding instruction books), <a href="Zishe%20Breitbart">Zishe Breitbart</a>, <a href="Georg%20Hackenschmidt">Georg Hackenschmidt</a>, Emy Nkemena, George F. Jowett, Finn Hateral (a pioneer in the art of posing), <a href="Frank%20Saldo">Frank Saldo</a>, <a href="Monte%20Saldo">Monte Saldo</a>, <a href="William%20Bankier">William Bankier</a>, Launceston Elliot, Sig Klein, Sgt. Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel Strongfort ("Strongfortism"), <a href="Gustav%20Fri%C5%A1tensk%C3%BD">Gustav Frištenský</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Parcaut">Ralph Parcaut</a> (a champion wrestler who also authored an early book on "physical culture"), and Alan P. Mead (who became an impressive muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>). Actor <a href="Francis%20X.%20Bushman">Francis X. Bushman</a>, who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous silent movie career.

Bodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for bulking up and cutting down, the use of protein and other food supplements, and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, most notably the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB), founded by Canadian brothers <a href="Joe%20Weider">Joe</a> and <a href="Ben%20Weider">Ben Weider</a>. Other bodybuilding organizations included the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the male-dominated contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many "Mr. (insert town, city, state, or region)" championships, the most prestigious titles were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia (which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world).

During the 1950s, the most famous competing bodybuilders were <a href="Bill%20Pearl">Bill Pearl</a>, <a href="Reg%20Park">Reg Park</a>, <a href="Leroy%20Colbert">Leroy Colbert</a>, and <a href="Clarence%20Ross">Clarence Ross</a>. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as movies. The most notable were <a href="Jack%20LaLanne">Jack LaLanne</a>, <a href="Steve%20Reeves">Steve Reeves</a>, Reg Park, and <a href="Mickey%20Hargitay">Mickey Hargitay</a>. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in <a href="North%20Hollywood%2C%20California">North Hollywood, California</a> and <a href="Vic%20Tanny">Vic Tanny</a>'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no "hardcore" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of <a href="Gold%27s%20Gym">Gold's Gym</a> in the mid-1960s. Finally, the famed <a href="Muscle%20Beach">Muscle Beach</a> in <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica, California</a> continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The 1960s grew more in TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> in popular shows and movies.

In the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a href="Franco%20Columbu">Franco Columbu</a>, <a href="Lou%20Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a>, and others in the 1977 docudrama "<a href="Pumping%20Iron">Pumping Iron</a>". By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Union">Amateur Athletic Union</a> (AAU) took a back seat. The <a href="National%20Physique%20Committee">National Physique Committee</a> (NPC) was formed in 1981 by <a href="Jim%20Manion">Jim Manion</a>, who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America, and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.

This period also saw the rise of <a href="anabolic%20steroid">anabolic steroid</a>s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of "mass monsters", beginning with <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a href="Sergio%20Oliva">Sergio Oliva</a>, and <a href="Lou%20Ferrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing to the present day with <a href="Lee%20Haney">Lee Haney</a>, <a href="Dorian%20Yates">Dorian Yates</a>, <a href="Ronnie%20Coleman">Ronnie Coleman</a>, and <a href="Markus%20R%C3%BChl">Markus Rühl</a>. Bodybuilders such as <a href="Greg%20Kovacs">Greg Kovacs</a> and <a href="Paul%20Demayo">Paul Demayo</a> attained mass and size that were not seen previously, but were not particularly successful at the pro level. At the time of shooting "Pumping Iron", Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that "you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition". He would later say that he does not regret using anything.

To combat steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the <a href="IOC">IOC</a>, the IFBB introduced <a href="Use%20of%20performance-enhancing%20drugs%20in%20sport">doping</a> tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal. In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Congress</a> placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the <a href="Controlled%20Substances%20Act">Controlled Substances Act</a> (CSA). In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, steroids were added to the <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Canadian Criminal Code</a> as a Class IV controlled substance (a class created expressly for steroids).

In 1990, <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> promoter <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> announced that he was forming a new bodybuilding organization named the <a href="World%20Bodybuilding%20Federation">World Bodybuilding Federation</a> (WBF). McMahon wanted to bring <a href="WWE">WWF</a>-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large, and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was <a href="Gary%20Strydom">Gary Strydom</a>. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine "Bodybuilding Lifestyles" (later "WBF Magazine"), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.

In 2003, <a href="Joe%20Weider">Joe Weider</a> sold Weider Publications to <a href="American%20Media%20%28publisher%29">AMI</a>, which owns the "<a href="National%20Enquirer">National Enquirer</a>". The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of <a href="Ben%20Weider">Ben Weider</a> in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest. Other professional contests emerged in this period, such as the <a href="Arnold%20Classic">Arnold Classic</a>, <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%28bodybuilding%29">Night of Champions</a>, and the European Grand Prix of Bodybuilding.

In the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders emerged from former <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> states.

In the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial, since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.

In 2014, the FTM Fitness Conference hosted the FTM Fitness World Bodybuilding Competition, the first bodybuilding competition for <a href="transgender">transgender</a> men.

In the modern bodybuilding industry, the term "<a href="Professional%20bodybuilding">professional</a>" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a "pro card" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card. Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.

Due to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves "natural" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the "freakish" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.

In natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from <a href="Polygraph%20test">lie detectors</a> to <a href="urinalysis">urinalysis</a>. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations. Some of the larger ones include MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.

Other notable natural bodybuilding organization include the <a href="National%20Physique%20Committee">National Physique Committee</a> (NPC) and the North American Natural Bodybuilding Federation (NANBF). NPC competitions screen competitors using ineffective lie detector tests to ensure fair practices. Such tests are very error prone, and some competitors are not even tested.

This is how the NPC differs from the NANBF. The NANBF takes a more direct approach by taking urine samples from all competitors that are tested for steroids and any other substances on the banned list. The NANBF also differs from the NPC when it comes to judging. The criteria of certain poses differs from organization to organization. The NANBF even has an elevated calf pose which is unique for their competitions.

The first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a> in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest—that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity. In 1980, the first <a href="Ms.%20Olympia">Ms. Olympia</a> (initially known as the "Miss" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was <a href="Rachel%20McLish">Rachel McLish</a>, who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called "" was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 <a href="Caesars%20Palace">Caesars Palace</a> World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, <a href="Bev%20Francis">Bev Francis</a>, and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a <a href="Powerlifting">powerlifter</a>, though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

In recent years, the related areas of <a href="fitness%20and%20figure%20competition">fitness and figure competition</a> have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a gymnastic element to them. A study by the "<a href="Clinical%20Journal%20of%20Sport%20Medicine">Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine</a>" found that female bodybuilders who are taking <a href="anabolic%20steroids">anabolic steroids</a> are more likely to have qualified for <a href="Substance%20dependence">substance dependence disorder</a> and have been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness and have a history of sexual abuse.

E Wilma Conner competed in the 2011 NPC Armbrust Pro Gym Warrior Classic Championships in <a href="Loveland%2C%20Colorado">Loveland, Colorado</a>, at the age of 75 years and 349 days.

In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to develop and maintain an <a href="aesthetics">aesthetically</a> pleasing body and balanced physique. In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses: the front lat spread, rear lat spread, <a href="wikt%3Afront%20double%20biceps">front double biceps</a>, <a href="wikt%3Aback%20double%20biceps">back double biceps</a>, <a href="wikt%3Aside%20chest">side chest</a>, <a href="wikt%3Aside%20triceps">side triceps</a>, <a href="Most%20Muscular">Most Muscular</a> (men only), and the thigh abdominal. Each competitor also performs a routine to display their physique. A <a href="posedown">posedown</a> is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders spend a lot of time practising their posing in mirrors.

In contrast to <a href="strongman%20%28strength%20athlete%29">strongman</a> or <a href="powerlifting">powerlifting</a> competitions, where <a href="physical%20strength">physical strength</a> is important, or to <a href="Olympic%20weightlifting">Olympic weightlifting</a>, where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.

The general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the "off-season") and, approximately 12–14 weeks from competition, attempt to lose <a href="Adipose%20tissue">body fat</a> (referred to as "cutting"). The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance (<a href="calorie">calorie</a> surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of growth.

The cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.

The precise effectiveness of the cutting and bulking strategy is unknown, with only limited observational case studies on the subject. No studies involving precise hypercaloric feeding combined with resistance exercise have been conducted.

Many non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt the conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the "bulking" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief "competition season".

"Dirty bulking" is the process of eating at a caloric surplus, without finding the exact number of macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weight lifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly often choose to use the "dirty bulk" method.

In the week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders may decrease their consumption of <a href="water">water</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, and <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a>s may be introduced, while <a href="carbohydrate%20loading">carbohydrate loading</a> is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or "<a href="vascularity">vascularity</a>". The appearance of veins is further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through <a href="sunless%20tanning">tanning products</a> and applying <a href="vegetable%20oil">oils</a> to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step is the use of weights to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size.

Bodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy:

Bodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto "eat clean, train hard, sleep well".

<a href="Weight%20training">Weight training</a> causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as <a href="microtrauma">microtrauma</a>. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called <a href="delayed%20onset%20muscle%20soreness">delayed onset muscle soreness</a> (DOMS). It is the repair to these micro-trauma that result in <a href="muscle%20growth">muscle growth</a>. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.

Weight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of <a href="Muscle%20hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a>: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight. In either case, there is an increase in size and strength of the muscles (compared to if that same individual does not lift weights at all). However, the emphasis is different.

Many trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals. i.e. a bodybuilder will use sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time, but may change to myofibrillar hypertrophy temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from "muscular confusion".

The high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more <a href="Food%20energy">calories</a> than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. A sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with <a href="cardiovascular%20exercise">cardiovascular exercise</a> to lose <a href="body%20fat">body fat</a> in preparation for a contest. The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.

<a href="Carbohydrate">Carbohydrate</a>s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis. Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains. It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein—which also induces the release of insulin—it is impossible to add muscle mass. Bodybuilders seek out <a href="glycemic%20index">low-glycemic</a> <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-<a href="glycemic%20index">glycemic</a> sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure <a href="glucose">dextrose</a> or <a href="maltodextrin">maltodextrin</a>) after a workout. This may help to replenish <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> stores within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.

The motor proteins <a href="actin">actin</a> and <a href="myosin">myosin</a> generate the forces exerted by contracting <a href="muscle">muscle</a>s. Current advice says that bodybuilders should consume 25–30% of protein per total <a href="calorie">calorie</a> intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition. This is a widely debated topic, with many arguing that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day is ideal, some suggesting that less is sufficient, while others recommending 1.5, 2, or more. It is believed that protein needs to be consumed frequently throughout the day, especially during/after a workout, and before sleep. There is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take. Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans and lentils. <a href="Casein">Casein</a> or <a href="whey%20protein">whey</a> are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements, and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high <a href="Biological%20Value">Biological Value (BV)</a> and quick absorption rates. However, <a href="whey%20protein">whey</a> has a bigger effect than Casein on insulin levels. <a href="whey%20protein">Whey</a> triggers about double the amount of insulin release. That effect is somewhat overcome by combining <a href="Casein">Casein</a> and <a href="whey%20protein">whey</a>. Bodybuilders are usually thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of <a href="soy">soy</a>, which is additionally avoided due to its claimed <a href="estrogenic">estrogenic</a> properties. Still, some nutrition experts believe that soy, <a href="flax%20seeds">flax seeds</a> and many other plants that contain the weak estrogen-like compounds or <a href="phytoestrogens">phytoestrogens</a> can be used beneficially, as phytoestrogens compete with estrogens for receptor sites in the male body and can block its actions. This can also include some inhibition of <a href="pituitary">pituitary</a> functions while stimulating the P450 system (the system that eliminates hormones, drugs and metabolic waste product from the body) in the liver to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen. <a href="Cortisol">Cortisol</a> decreases amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibits protein synthesis.

Contrary to certain rumors that animal-based protein is more suitable to trigger muscle growth than plant-based protein, a study by Mangano et al. (2017) could not provide any evidence for this. In contrast, if combined properly plant-based protein even has a higher biological quality. A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g. <a href="seitan">seitan</a>) and two parts soy protein (e.g. <a href="tofu">tofu</a>) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders. Some bodybuilders, such as <a href="Patrik%20Baboumian">Patrik Baboumian</a> and <a href="Robert%20Cheeke">Robert Cheeke</a>, follow a strict <a href="Veganism">vegan</a> diet.

Bodybuilders often split their food intake for the day into 5 to 7 meals of roughly equal nutritional content and attempt to eat at regular intervals (e.g. every 2 to 3 hours). This method can serve two purposes: to limit overindulging in the cutting phase, and to physically allow for the consumption of large volumes of food during the bulking phase. Contrary to popular belief, eating more frequently does not increase <a href="metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a> when compared to the traditional 3 meals a day. While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the <a href="thermic%20effect%20of%20food">thermic effect of food</a>, it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day. Well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and <a href="doubly%20labeled%20water">doubly labeled water</a> have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.

The important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of <a href="dietary%20supplements">dietary supplements</a>. Various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies. There are three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order for muscle building. The major nutrients – protein, carbohydrate, and fat – provide the body with energy.

Some bodybuilders use drugs such as <a href="anabolic%20steroids">anabolic steroids</a> and precursor substances such as <a href="prohormone">prohormone</a>s to increase <a href="muscle%20hypertrophy">muscle hypertrophy</a>. Anabolic steroids cause muscle <a href="hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a> of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers caused likely by an increased synthesis of muscle proteins and are accompanied with undesired side effects including <a href="hepatotoxicity">hepatotoxicity</a>, <a href="gynecomastia">gynecomastia</a>, <a href="acne">acne</a>, early onset <a href="male%20pattern%20baldness">male pattern baldness</a> and a decline in the body's own testosterone production, which can cause <a href="testicular%20atrophy">testicular atrophy</a>. Other performance-enhancing substances used by competitive bodybuilders include <a href="Growth%20hormone%20treatment">human growth hormone</a> (HGH), which can cause <a href="acromegaly">acromegaly</a>.

Muscle growth is more difficult to achieve in older adults than younger adults because of <a href="biological%20aging">biological aging</a>, which leads to many metabolic changes detrimental to muscle growth; for instance, by diminishing growth hormone and <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>. Some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose HGH treatment for adults with HGH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing <a href="muscle">muscle</a> mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing <a href="bone">bone</a> density and muscle strength, improves <a href="cardiovascular">cardiovascular</a> parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.

A recent trend in bodybuilding is to inject <a href="synthol%20%28bodybuilding%29">synthol</a> into muscles to create larger bulges, or injecting <a href="Poly%28methyl%20methacrylate%29">PMMA</a> into muscles to shape them. Use of PMMA to shape muscles is prohibited in the United States.

Although muscle "stimulation" occurs in the <a href="gym">gym</a> (or home gym) when lifting weights, muscle "growth" occurs afterward during rest. Without adequate rest and sleep (6 to 8 hours), muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and build. About eight hours of sleep a night is desirable for the bodybuilder to be refreshed, although this varies from person to person. Additionally, many athletes find a daytime nap further increases their body's ability to build muscles. Some individual bodybuilders add a <a href="massage">massage</a>, sometimes by professional masseuse, massager or masseur at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering.

Overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where his workload exceeds his recovery capacity. There are many reasons that overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> (CNS) and can result in a hyper-adrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns. To avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. Timely provision of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, <a href="Protein%20%28nutrient%29">proteins</a>, and various micronutrients such as <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s, <a href="Dietary%20mineral">minerals</a>, phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical.

It has been argued that overtraining can be beneficial. One article published by "<a href="Muscle%20%26amp%3B%20Fitness">Muscle & Fitness</a>" magazine stated that you can "Overtrain for Big Gains". It suggested that if one is planning a restful holiday and they do not wish to inhibit their bodybuilding lifestyle too much, they should overtrain before taking the holiday, so the body can rest easily and recuperate and grow. Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase. These are known as "shock micro-cycles" and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes.

Some bodybuilders, particularly at the professional level, inject substances such as "site enhancement oil", commonly known as synthol, to mimic the appearance of developed muscle where it may otherwise be disproportionate or lagging. This is known as "fluffing". Synthol is 85% oil, 7.5% <a href="lidocaine">lidocaine</a>, and 7.5% alcohol. It is not restricted, and many brands are available on the Internet. The use of injected oil to enhance muscle appearance is common among bodybuilders, despite the fact that synthol can cause <a href="pulmonary%20embolism">pulmonary embolism</a>s, nerve damage, infections, <a href="sclerosing%20lipogranuloma">sclerosing lipogranuloma</a>, stroke, and the formation of oil-filled <a href="granuloma">granuloma</a>s, <a href="cyst">cyst</a>s or ulcers in the muscle. <a href="Sesame%20oil">Sesame oil</a> is often used, which can cause allergic reactions such as <a href="vasculitis">vasculitis</a>. An aesthetic issue is drooping of muscle under gravity.

Biological warfare

Biological warfare (BW)—also known as germ warfare—is the use of <a href="Toxin%23Biotoxins">biological toxins</a> or <a href="Pathogen">infectious agents</a> such as <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="virus">virus</a>es, and <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war. <a href="Biological%20agent">Biological weapon</a>s (often termed "bio-weapons", "biological threat agents", or "bio-agents") are living <a href="organism">organism</a>s or replicating entities (<a href="virus">virus</a>es, which are not universally considered "alive") that reproduce or replicate within their <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">host</a> victims. <a href="Entomological%20warfare">Entomological (insect) warfare</a> is also considered a type of biological weapon. This type of warfare is distinct from <a href="nuclear%20warfare">nuclear warfare</a> and <a href="chemical%20warfare">chemical warfare</a>, which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military acronym for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using <a href="Weapon%20of%20mass%20destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a> (WMDs). None of these are <a href="conventional%20weapon">conventional weapon</a>s, which are deployed primarily for their <a href="explosion">explosive</a>, <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic</a>, or <a href="incendiary%20device">incendiary</a> potential.

Biological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or <a href="Tactic%20%28method%29">tactical</a> advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some of the <a href="chemical%20weapon">chemical weapon</a>s, biological weapons may also be useful as <a href="area%20denial%20weapon">area denial weapon</a>s. These agents may be lethal or <a href="Non-lethal%20weapon">non-lethal</a>, and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>s or by non-national groups. In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses it <a href="Clandestine%20operation">clandestinely</a>, it may also be considered <a href="bioterrorism">bioterrorism</a>.

There is an overlap between biological warfare and chemical warfare, as the use of <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s produced by living organisms is considered under the provisions of both the <a href="Biological%20Weapons%20Convention">Biological Weapons Convention</a> and the <a href="Chemical%20Weapons%20Convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a>. Toxins and <a href="Psychochemical%20warfare">psychochemical weapons</a> are often referred to as "midspectrum agents". Unlike bioweapons, these midspectrum agents do not reproduce in their host and are typically characterized by shorter incubation periods.

The use of biological weapons is prohibited under <a href="Customary%20international%20law">customary</a> <a href="international%20humanitarian%20law">international humanitarian law</a>, as well as a variety of international <a href="treaty">treaties</a>. The use of biological agents in armed conflict is a <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>.

Offensive biological warfare, including <a href="mass%20production">mass production</a>, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The <a href="Theory%20of%20justification">rationale</a> behind this <a href="treaty">treaty</a>, which has been <a href="Ratification">ratified</a> or acceded to by <a href="List%20of%20parties%20to%20the%20Biological%20Weapons%20Convention">170 countries</a> as of April 2013, is to prevent a biological attack which could conceivably result in large numbers of <a href="civilian%20casualties">civilian casualties</a> and cause severe disruption to <a href="economic">economic</a> and <a href="Social%20infrastructure">societal infrastructure</a>. Many countries, including signatories of the BWC, currently pursue research into the defense or protection against BW, which is not prohibited by the BWC.

A nation or group that can pose a credible threat of mass casualty has the ability to alter the terms on which other nations or groups interact with it. Biological weapons allow for the potential to create a level of destruction and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons, relative to their mass and cost of development and storage. Therefore, biological agents may be useful as strategic deterrents in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield.

As a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force. Some biological agents (<a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="pneumonic%20plague">pneumonic plague</a>) have the capability of person-to-person <a href="Transmission%20%28medicine%29">transmission</a> via <a href="Bioaerosol">aerosolized</a> <a href="Droplet%20contact">respiratory droplets</a>. This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces. While containment of BW is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations.

Rudimentary forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity. During the 6th century BC, the <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a> poisoned enemy wells with a fungus that would render the enemy delirious. In 1346, the bodies of <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol</a> warriors of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a> who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a>n city of <a href="Caffa">Kaffa</a>. Specialists disagree over whether this operation may have been responsible for the spread of the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> into Europe.

The <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> used smallpox against Native Americans during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20Pitt">Siege of Fort Pitt</a> in 1763. An outbreak that left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in <a href="Ohio%20Country">Ohio Country</a> was reported in 1764. The spread of the disease weakened the natives' resistance to the British troops led by Henry Bouquet. It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the <a href="Lenape">Delaware people</a>. It has been claimed that the <a href="Royal%20Marines">British Marines</a> used <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in New South Wales in 1789.

By 1900 the <a href="germ%20theory">germ theory</a> and advances in <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a> brought a new level of sophistication to the techniques for possible use of <a href="bio-agent">bio-agent</a>s in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> and <a href="glanders">glanders</a>—was undertaken on behalf of the <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial German</a> government during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–1918), with indifferent results. The <a href="Geneva%20Protocol">Geneva Protocol</a> of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical weapons and biological weapons.

With the onset of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> established a BW program at <a href="Porton%20Down">Porton Down</a>, headed by the microbiologist <a href="Paul%20Fildes">Paul Fildes</a>. The research was championed by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and soon <a href="tularemia">tularemia</a>, <a href="Anthrax%20disease">anthrax</a>, <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, and <a href="botulism">botulism</a> toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, <a href="Gruinard%20Island">Gruinard Island</a> in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program was the first to successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs.

When the USA entered the war, Allied resources were pooled at the request of the British and the U.S. established a large research program and industrial complex at <a href="Fort%20Detrick%2C%20Maryland">Fort Detrick, Maryland</a> in 1942 under the direction of <a href="George%20W.%20Merck">George W. Merck</a>. The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the <a href="Dugway%20Proving%20Grounds">Dugway Proving Grounds</a> in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Soon there were facilities for the mass production of anthrax spores, <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, and <a href="botulism">botulism</a> toxins, although the war was over before these weapons could be of much operational use.

The most notorious program of the period was run by the secret <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> <a href="Unit%20731">Unit 731</a> during the <a href="Sino-Japanese%20War%20%281937%E2%80%931945%29">war</a>, based at <a href="Pingfan">Pingfan</a> in <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="Shir%C5%8D%20Ishii">Shirō Ishii</a>. This unit did research on BW, conducted often fatal <a href="human%20experimentation">human experiments</a> on prisoners, and produced biological weapons for combat use. Although the Japanese effort lacked the technological sophistication of the American or British programs, it far outstripped them in its widespread application and indiscriminate brutality. Biological weapons were used against both Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns. In 1940, the Japanese Army Air Force bombed <a href="Ningbo">Ningbo</a> with ceramic bombs full of fleas carrying the bubonic plague. Many of these operations were ineffective due to inefficient delivery systems, although up to 400,000 people may have died. During the <a href="Zhejiang-Jiangxi%20Campaign">Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign</a> in 1942, around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their own biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.

During the final months of World War II, Japan planned to use plague as a biological weapon against U.S. civilians in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, during <a href="Operation%20Cherry%20Blossoms%20at%20Night">Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night</a>. The plan was set to launch on 22 September 1945, but it was not executed because of <a href="Japan%27s%20surrender">Japan's surrender</a> on 15 August 1945.

In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of <a href="Bubonic%20plague">plague</a>, <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, <a href="tularemia">tularemia</a> and later <a href="Eastern%20equine%20encephalitis%20virus">equine encephalomyelitis</a> and <a href="vaccinia">vaccinia</a> <a href="virus">virus</a>es, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Biological%20Warfare%20Laboratories">United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories</a> weaponized <a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">anthrax</a>, <a href="Francisella%20tularensis">tularemia</a>, <a href="Brucella">brucellosis</a>, <a href="Coxiella%20burnetii">Q-fever</a> and others.

In 1969, the UK and the Warsaw Pact, separately, introduced proposals to the UN to ban biological weapons, and US President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> terminated production of biological weapons, allowing only scientific research for defensive measures. The <a href="Biological%20and%20Toxin%20Weapons%20Convention">Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention</a> was signed by the US, UK, USSR and other nations, as a ban on "development, production and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research" in 1972. However, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> continued research and production of massive offensive biological weapons in a program called <a href="Biopreparat">Biopreparat</a>, despite having signed the convention. By 2011, 165 countries had signed the treaty and none are proven—though nine are still suspected—to possess offensive BW programs.

It has been argued that rational state actors would never use biological weapons offensively. The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment. Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force.

Ideal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high <a href="infectivity">infectivity</a>, high <a href="virulence">virulence</a>, non-availability of <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s, and availability of an effective and efficient <a href="delivery%20system">delivery system</a>. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered. Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.

The primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can often be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.

For example, "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>" is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy <a href="spore">spore</a>s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary <a href="influenza">influenza</a>-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal <a href="hemorrhagic">hemorrhagic</a> <a href="mediastinitis">mediastinitis</a> within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients. Finally, friendly personnel can be protected with suitable <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s.

A large-scale attack using anthrax would require the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5 <a href="%C2%B5m">µm</a>: larger particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract, while smaller particles would be exhaled back out into the atmosphere. At this size, <a href="Electrical%20conductivity">conductive</a> powders tend to aggregate because of <a href="Electric%20charge">electrostatic charges</a>, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung. There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.

Agents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as "Bacillus anthracis", "<a href="Brucella">Brucella</a> spp.", "<a href="Burkholderia%20mallei">Burkholderia mallei</a>", "<a href="Burkholderia%20pseudomallei">Burkholderia pseudomallei</a>", "<a href="Chlamydophila%20psittaci">Chlamydophila psittaci</a>", "<a href="Coxiella%20burnetii">Coxiella burnetii</a>", "<a href="Francisella%20tularensis">Francisella tularensis</a>", some of the <a href="Rickettsiaceae">Rickettsiaceae</a> (especially "<a href="Rickettsia%20prowazekii">Rickettsia prowazekii</a>" and "<a href="Rickettsia%20rickettsii">Rickettsia rickettsii</a>"), "<a href="Shigella">Shigella</a> spp.", "<a href="Vibrio%20cholerae">Vibrio cholerae</a>", and "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>". Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the <a href="Bunyaviridae">Bunyaviridae</a> (especially <a href="Rift%20Valley%20fever">Rift Valley fever virus</a>), <a href="Ebola">Ebola</a>virus, many of the <a href="Flaviviridae">Flaviviridae</a> (especially <a href="Japanese%20encephalitis">Japanese encephalitis virus</a>), <a href="Bolivian%20hemorrhagic%20fever">Machupo virus</a>, <a href="Marburg%20virus">Marburg virus</a>, Variola virus, and <a href="Yellow%20fever">Yellow fever virus</a>. Fungal agents that have been studied include "<a href="Coccidioides">Coccidioides</a> spp.".

Toxins that can be used as weapons include <a href="ricin">ricin</a>, <a href="Staphylococcal%20Enterotoxin%20B">staphylococcal enterotoxin B</a>, <a href="botulinum%20toxin">botulinum toxin</a>, <a href="saxitoxin">saxitoxin</a>, and many <a href="mycotoxin">mycotoxin</a>s. These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as <a href="select%20agent">select agent</a>s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>'s Select Agent Program.

The former <a href="US%20biological%20warfare%20program">US biological warfare program</a> categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either Lethal Agents ("Bacillus anthracis", "Francisella tularensis", Botulinum toxin) or Incapacitating Agents ("Brucella suis", "Coxiella burnetii", Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).

Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries; 
The United States developed an anti-crop capability during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> that used plant diseases (<a href="bioherbicide">bioherbicide</a>s, or <a href="mycoherbicide">mycoherbicide</a>s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart <a href="Sino-Soviet%20relations">Sino-Soviet</a> aggression in a general war. Diseases such as <a href="wheat%20blast">wheat blast</a> and <a href="rice%20blast">rice blast</a> were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases. Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.

Though herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as <a href="biotoxin">biotoxin</a>s or bioregulators. The Army Biological Laboratory tested each agent and the Army's Technical Escort Unit was responsible for transport of all chemical, biological, radiological (nuclear) materials. Scorched earth tactics or destroying livestock and farmland were carried out in the Vietnam war (cf. Agent Orange) and <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20Civil%20War">Eelam War</a> in Sri Lanka.

Biological warfare can also specifically target plants to destroy crops or defoliate vegetation. The United States and Britain discovered plant growth regulators (i.e., <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s) during the Second World War, and initiated a <a href="herbicidal%20warfare">herbicidal warfare</a> program that was eventually used in <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> and <a href="Agent%20Orange">Vietnam</a> in <a href="counterinsurgency">counterinsurgency</a> operations.

In 1980s Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had successfully developed variants of <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a>, and <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a> against cows, <a href="African%20swine%20fever">African swine fever</a> for pigs, and <a href="psittacosis">psittacosis</a> to kill chicken. These agents were prepared to spray them down from tanks attached to airplanes over hundreds of miles. The secret program was code-named "Ecology".

During the <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau Uprising</a> in 1952, the poisonous <a href="latex">latex</a> of the <a href="Euphorbia%20grantii">African milk bush</a> was used to kill cattle.

Entomological warfare (EW) is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy. The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era. EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program. EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a <a href="biological%20agent">biological agent</a>, such as <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> and then dispersing the insects over target areas. The insects then act as a <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a>, infecting any person or animal they might bite. Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture. The final method uses uninfected insects, such as bees, wasps, etc., to directly attack the enemy.

In 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>
the <a href="sanitary%20epidemiological%20reconnaissance">sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance</a> was suggested as well-tested means for enhancing the monitoring of infections and parasitic agents, for practical implementation of the <a href="International%20Health%20Regulations">International Health Regulations</a> (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties.

It is important to note that most classical and modern biological weapons' pathogens can be obtained from a plant or an animal which is naturally infected.

Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident known– the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>) in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1979, sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city and still off limits to visitors today, (see <a href="Sverdlovsk%20Anthrax%20leak">Sverdlovsk Anthrax leak</a>).

Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill.

For example, in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24–36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique <a href="chest%20X-ray">chest X-ray</a> finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports). The incubation period for humans is estimated to be about 11.8 days to 12.1 days. This suggested period is the first model that is independently consistent with data from the largest known human outbreak. These projections refines previous estimates of the distribution of early onset cases after a release and supports a recommended 60-day course of prophylactic antibiotic treatment for individuals exposed to low doses of anthrax. By making these data available to local public health officials in real time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoid the moderately high mortality of the disease.

From most specific to least specific:


The goal of <a href="biodefense">biodefense</a> is to integrate the sustained efforts of the national and homeland security, medical, public health, intelligence, diplomatic, and law enforcement communities. Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the <a href="first%20Gulf%20War">first Gulf War</a> the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, <a href="Task%20Force%20Scorpio">Task Force Scorpio</a>, to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.

The traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.

The growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (LLNL), employs a "sandwich immunoassay", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.

In the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the company <a href="Netherlands%20Organisation%20for%20Applied%20Scientific%20Research">TNO</a> has designed <a href="BiosparQ">Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment</a> (BiosparQ). This system would be implemented into the national response plan for bioweapon attacks in the Netherlands.

Researchers at <a href="Ben%20Gurion%20University">Ben Gurion University</a> in Israel are developing a different device called the BioPen, essentially a "Lab-in-a-Pen", which can detect known biological agents in under 20 minutes using an adaptation of the <a href="ELISA">ELISA</a>, a similar widely employed immunological technique, that in this case incorporates fiber optics.

Theoretically, novel approaches in biotechnology, such as synthetic biology could be used in the future to design novel types of biological warfare agents. Special attention has to be laid on future experiments (of concern) that:


Most of the biosecurity concerns in synthetic biology, however, are focused on the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu, polio) in the lab. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing. It was hailed by The Washington Post as "the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years." While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks.

pageRank.Book of Nehemiah

The pageRank.Book of Nehemiah is a book of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> often conjoined with the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezra">pageRank.Book of Ezra</a>. Told largely in the form of a first-person <a href="memoir">memoir</a>, it concerns the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by <a href="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a>, a Jew who is a high official at the Persian court, and the dedication of the city and its people to God's laws (<a href="Torah">Torah</a>).

The events take place in the second half of the 5th century BC. Listed together with the pageRank.Book of Ezra as <a href="Ezra-Nehemiah">Ezra-Nehemiah</a>, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.

The original core of the book, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezra">pageRank.Book of Ezra</a> around 400 BC. Further editing probably continued into the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic era</a>.

The book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in <a href="Susa">Susa</a>, is informed that <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> is without walls, and resolves to restore them. The king appoints him as governor of <a href="Yehud%20Medinata">Judah</a> and he travels to Jerusalem. There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the <a href="law%20of%20Moses">law of Moses</a>. After 12 years in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, he returns to <a href="Susa">Susa</a> but subsequently revisits Jerusalem. He finds that the Israelites have been <a href="backsliding">backsliding</a> and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law.

The book is set in the 5th century BC. Judah is one of several provinces within a larger satrapy (a large administrative unit) within the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>. The capital of the empire is at <a href="Susa">Susa</a>. Nehemiah is a <a href="cup-bearer">cup-bearer</a> to king <a href="Artaxerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes I of Persia</a> – an important official position.

At his own request Nehemiah is sent to Jerusalem as governor of Yehud, the official Persian name for Judah. Jerusalem had been conquered and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC and Nehemiah finds it still in ruins. His task is to rebuild the walls and to re-populate the city. He faces opposition from three powerful neighbours, the <a href="Samaritans">Samaritans</a>, the <a href="Ammon">Ammonites</a>, and the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, as well as the city of <a href="Ashdod">Ashdod</a>, but manages to rebuild the walls. He then purifies the Jewish community by enforcing its <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregation</a> from its neighbours and enforces the laws of Moses.

<a href="Ezra%E2%80%93Nehemiah">Ezra–Nehemiah</a>, grouped as a single book with the title "Ezra", was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BC. They were first divided into separate books by the early Christian scholar <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, in the 3rd century AD, and the separation became entrenched in the 5th century AD when it was followed by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> in his Latin translation of the Bible. It was not until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> that the separation was introduced into Jewish Bibles.

The combined book Ezra–Nehemiah of the earliest Christian and Jewish period was known as Ezra and was probably attributed to <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> himself; according to a rabbinic tradition, however, Nehemiah was the real author but was forbidden to claim authorship because of his bad habit of disparaging others.

The Nehemiah Memorial, chapters 1–7 and 11–13, may have circulated as an independent work before being combined with the Ezra material to form Ezra–Nehemiah. Determining the composition of the Memorial depends on the dates of Nehemiah's mission: It is commonly accepted that "Artaxerxes" was Artaxerxes I (there were two later kings of the same name), and that Nehemiah's first period in Jerusalem was therefore 445–433 BC; allowing for his return to Susa and second journey to Jerusalem, the end of the 5th century BC is therefore the earliest possible date for the Memorial. The Nehemiah Memorial is interrupted by chapters 8–10, which concern Ezra. These have sometimes been identified as another, separate work, the Ezra Memorial (EM), but other scholars believe the EM to be fictional and heavily altered by later editors. Both the Nehemiah and Ezra material are combined with numerous lists, Censuses and other material.

The first edition of the combined Ezra–Nehemiah may date from the early 4th century BC; further editing continued well into the following centuries.

<doc id="4363" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4363" title="pageRank.Book of Jeremiah">
pageRank.Book of Jeremiah

The pageRank.Book of Jeremiah (; abbreviated Jer. or Jerem. in citations) is the second of the <a href="Latter%20Prophets">Latter Prophets</a> in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, and the second of the Prophets in the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. The superscription at chapter 1:1–3 identifies it as "the words of <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> son of Hilkiah," and places the prophet historically from the reforms of king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> in 627 BCE through to the assassination of the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah in 582. Of all the prophets, Jeremiah comes through most clearly as a person, ruminating to his scribe <a href="Baruch%20ben%20Neriah">Baruch</a> about his role as a servant of God with little good news for his audience.

Jeremiah is written in a very complex and poetic Hebrew (apart from verse 10:11, curiously written in <a href="Biblical%20Aramaic">Biblical Aramaic</a>). It has come down in two distinct though related versions, one in Hebrew, the other known from a Greek translation. Scholars have had differing opinions as to how to reconstruct the historical aspects of the pageRank.Book of Jeremiah due to the differences each version contains when compared with each other. The book is a representation of the message and significance of the prophet substantially intended for the Jews in Babylonian exile: its purpose is to explain the disaster as God's response to Israel's pagan worship: the people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness make judgement inevitable, although restoration and a new covenant are foreshadowed.

It is difficult to discern any structure in Jeremiah, probably because the book had such a long and complex composition history. It can be divided into roughly 6 sections:

The background to Jeremiah is briefly described in the superscription to the book: Jeremiah began his prophetic mission in the thirteenth year of king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> (about 627 BCE) and finished in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah (586), "when Jerusalem went into exile in the sixth month." During this period, Josiah changed the Judahite religion, Babylon destroyed Assyria, Egypt briefly imposed vassal status on Judah, Babylon defeated Egypt and made Judah a Babylonian vassal (605), Judah revolted but was subjugated again by Babylon (597), and Judah revolted once more. This revolt was the final one: Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple and exiled its king and many of the leading citizens in 586, ending Judah's existence as an independent or quasi-independent kingdom and inaugurating the <a href="Babylonian%20exile">Babylonian exile</a>.

The book can be conveniently divided into biographical, prose and poetic strands, each of which can be summarised separately. 
The biographical material is to be found in chapters 26–29, 32, and 34–44, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in chapter 7 and the covenant passage in 11:1–17, are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the <a href="Deuteronomist">Deuteronomist</a>s, the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a> to <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>, and while it is unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah, they may well have their roots in traditions about what he said and did.
The poetic material found is found largely in chapters 1–25 and consists of oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger. These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book. Allied to them, and also probably a reflection of the authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiah's confessions or spiritual diary. In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness at those who oppose or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him.

<doc id="4364" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4364" title="pageRank.Book of Isaiah">
pageRank.Book of Isaiah

The pageRank.Book of Isaiah (, ) is the first of the <a href="Nevi%27im%23Latter%20Prophets">Latter Prophets</a> in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the first of the <a href="Major%20Prophet">Major Prophet</a>s in the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. The book is identified by a <a href="wiktionary%3Asuperscription">superscription</a> as the works of the 8th-century BCE prophet <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> ben Amoz, but there is ample evidence that much of it was composed during the <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> and later. <a href="Bernhard%20Duhm">Bernhard Duhm</a> originated the view, held as a consensus through most of the 20th century, that the book comprises three separate collections of oracles: "Proto-Isaiah" (chapters 1–39), containing the words of Isaiah; "Deutero-Isaiah" (chapters 40–55), the work of an anonymous 6th-century BCE author writing during the Exile; and "Trito-Isaiah" (chapters 56–66), composed after the return from Exile. While virtually no one today attributes the entire book, or even most of it, to one person, the book's essential unity has become a focus in current research. Isaiah 1–33 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations, and chapters 34–66 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration follows soon. It can thus be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Exile.

The Deutero-Isaian part of the book describes how God will make Jerusalem the centre of his worldwide rule through a royal saviour (a <a href="messiah">messiah</a>) who will destroy her oppressor (<a href="Neo-Babylonian%20empire">Babylon</a>); this messiah is the Persian king <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a>, who is merely the agent who brings about Yahweh's kingship. Isaiah speaks out against corrupt leaders and for the disadvantaged, and roots righteousness in God's holiness rather than in Israel's covenant. Isaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a>: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god". This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and the basis for <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="Islam">Islam</a>.

Isaiah was one of the most popular works among Jews in the <a href="Second%20Temple%20period">Second Temple period</a> (c. 515 BCE – 70 CE). In Christian circles, it was held in such high regard as to be called "the Fifth Gospel", and its influence extends beyond Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of <a href="Handel%27s%20Messiah">Handel's Messiah</a> to a host of such everyday phrases as "<a href="Swords%20to%20ploughshares">swords into ploughshares</a>" and "<a href="Voice%20in%20the%20Wilderness%20%28disambiguation%29">voice in the wilderness</a>".

The scholarly consensus which held sway through most of the 20th century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of Isaiah. A typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors:


While one part of the consensus still holds – virtually no contemporary scholar maintains that the entire book, or even most of it, was written by one person – this perception of Isaiah as made up of three rather distinct sections underwent a radical challenge in the last quarter of the 20th century. The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34:


Seeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1–33 and 34–66) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following:

The older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example:

While it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah. The observations which have led to this are as follows:

These observations led scholars to the conclusion that the book can be conveniently divided into three sections, labeled Proto-Isaiah, Deutero-Isaiah, and Trito-Isaiah. Early modern-period scholars treated Isaiah as independent collections of sayings by three individual prophets, brought together at a much later period, about 70 BCE, to form the present book. The second half of the 20th century saw a marked change in approach, and scholars have begun to detect a deliberate arrangement of materials to give the book an overarching theological message.

The composition history of Isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient Israel and in modern societies; the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous. While the authors are anonymous, it is plausible that all of them were priests, and the book may thus reflect <a href="Priestly%20source">Priestly</a> concerns, in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the <a href="Deuteronomist">Deuteronomist</a>s.

While it is widely accepted that Isaiah the prophet did not write the entire book, there are good reasons to see parts of chapters 1–39 as stemming from the historic Isaiah ben Amoz, who lived in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th century BCE. During this period, <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> was expanding westward from its origins in modern-day northern Iraq towards the Mediterranean, destroying first <a href="Aram-Damascus">Aram</a> (modern Syria) in 734–732 BCE, then the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Kingdom of Israel</a> in 722–721, and finally subjugating Judah in 701. Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages, and a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original 8th century Isaiah, while the prose sections are "sermons" on his texts composed at the court of <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> a hundred years later, at the end of the 7th century.

The conquest of Jerusalem by <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Babylon</a> and the exile of its elite in 586 BCE ushered in the next stage in the formation of the book. Deutero-Isaiah addresses himself to the Jews in exile, offering them the hope of return. This was the period of the meteoric rise of Persia under its king <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> – in 559 BCE he succeeded his father as ruler of a small vassal kingdom in modern eastern Iran, by 540 he ruled an empire stretching from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, and in 539 he conquered Babylon. Deutero-Isaiah's predictions of the imminent fall of Babylon and his glorification of Cyrus as the deliverer of Israel date his prophecies to 550–539 BCE, and probably towards the end of this period.

The Persians ended the Jewish exile, and by 515 BCE the exiles, or at least some of them, had returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple. The return, however, was not without problems: the returnees found themselves in conflict with those who had remained in the country and who now owned the land, and there were further conflicts over the form of government that should be set up. This background forms the context of Trito-Isaiah.

Isaiah is focused on the main role of Jerusalem in God's plan for the world, seeing centuries of history as though they were all the single vision of the 8th century prophet Isaiah. Proto-Isaiah speaks of Israel's desertion of God and what will follow: Israel will be destroyed by foreign enemies, but after the people, the country and Jerusalem are punished and purified, a holy remnant will live in God's place in Zion, governed by God's chosen king (the <a href="messiah">messiah</a>), under the presence and protection of God; Deutero-Isaiah has as its subject the liberation of Israel from captivity in Babylon in another <a href="The%20Exodus">Exodus</a>, which the God of Israel will arrange using Cyrus, the Persian conqueror, as his agent; Trito-Isaiah concerns Jerusalem, the Temple, the Sabbath, and Israel's salvation. (More explicitly, it concerns questions current among Jews living in Jerusalem and Palestine in the post-Exilic period about who is a God-loving Jew and who is not). <a href="Walter%20Brueggemann">Walter Brueggemann</a> has described this overarching narrative as "a continued meditation upon the destiny of Jerusalem".

God's plan for the world is based on his choice of Jerusalem as the place where he will manifest himself, and of the line of <a href="David">David</a> as his earthly representative – a theme that may possibly have been created through Jerusalem's reprieve from Assyrian attack in 701 BCE. God is "the holy one of Israel"; justice and righteousness are the qualities that mark the essence of God, and Israel has offended God through unrighteousness. Isaiah speaks out for the poor and the oppressed and against corrupt princes and judges, but unlike the prophets <a href="book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a> and <a href="book%20of%20Micah">Micah</a> he roots righteousness not in Israel's covenant with God but in God's holiness.

Isaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a>: "I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no god". In Isaiah 44:09–20, this is developed into a satire on the making and worship of idols, mocking the foolishness of the carpenter who worships the idol that he himself has carved. While Yahweh had shown his superiority to other gods before, in Second Isaiah, he becomes the sole God of the world. This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> and became the basis for Christianity and Islam.

A central theme in Second Isaiah is that of a new Exodus – the return of the exiled people Israel from Babylon to Jerusalem. The author imagines a ritualistic return to Zion (Judah) led by Yahweh. The importance of this theme is indicated by its placement at the beginning and end of Second Isaiah (40:3–5, 55:12–13). This new Exodus is repeatedly linked with Israel's <a href="The%20Exodus">Exodus</a> from Egypt to Canaan under divine guidance, but with new elements. These links include the following:

Isaiah was one of the most popular works in the period between the foundation of the Second Temple c. 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE. Isaiah's "shoot [which] will come up from the stump of Jesse" is alluded to or cited in the <a href="Psalms%20of%20Solomon">Psalms of Solomon</a> and various apocalyptic works including the <a href="Similitudes%20of%20Enoch">Similitudes of Enoch</a>, <a href="2%20Baruch">2 Baruch</a>, <a href="2%20Esdras">4 Ezra</a>, and the third of the <a href="Sibylline%20oracles">Sibylline oracles</a>, all of which understood it to refer to a/the messiah and the messianic age. Isaiah 6, in which Isaiah describes his vision of God enthroned in the Temple, influenced the visions of God in works such as the "pageRank.Book of the Watchers" section of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Enoch">pageRank.Book of Enoch</a>, the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">pageRank.Book of Daniel</a> and others, often combined with the similar vision from the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezekiel">pageRank.Book of Ezekiel</a>. A very influential portion of Isaiah was the four so-called <a href="Songs%20of%20the%20Suffering%20Servant">Songs of the Suffering Servant</a> from Isaiah 42, 49, 50 and 52, in which God calls upon his servant to lead the nations (the servant is horribly abused, sacrifices himself in accepting the punishment due others, and is finally rewarded). Some <a href="Second%20Temple%20Judaism">Second Temple</a> texts, including the <a href="Wisdom%20of%20Solomon">Wisdom of Solomon</a> and the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Daniel">pageRank.Book of Daniel</a> identified the Servant as a group – "the wise" who "will lead many to righteousness" (Daniel 12:3) – but others, notably the <a href="Similitudes%20of%20Enoch">Similitudes of Enoch</a>, understood it in messianic terms. The earliest Christians, building on this second tradition, interpreted Isaiah 52:13–53:12, the fourth of the songs, as a prophecy of the death and exaltation of Jesus, a role which Jesus himself accepted according to Luke 4:17–21.

The pageRank.Book of Isaiah has been immensely influential in the formation of Christianity, from the devotion to the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> to anti-Jewish polemic, medieval passion iconography, and modern <a href="Christian%20feminism">Christian feminism</a> and <a href="liberation%20theology">liberation theology</a>. The regard in which Isaiah was held was so high that the book was frequently called "the Fifth Gospel", the prophet who spoke more clearly of Christ and the Church than any others. Its influence extends beyond the Church and Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of <a href="Handel%27s%20Messiah">Handel's Messiah</a> to a host of such everyday phrases as "swords into ploughshares" and "voice in the wilderness".

The <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> quotes and states that "Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him." Isaiah makes up 27 of the 37 quotations from the prophets in the <a href="Pauline%20epistles">Pauline epistles</a>, and takes pride of place in the Gospels and in <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>. , where the prophet is assuring king <a href="Ahaz">Ahaz</a> that God will save Judah from the invading armies of Israel and Syria, forms the basis for 's doctrine of the virgin birth, while Isaiah 40:3–5's image of the exiled Israel led by God and proceeding home to Jerusalem on a newly constructed road through the wilderness was taken up by all four Gospels and applied to <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> and Jesus.

Isaiah seems always to have had a prominent place in Jewish Bible use, and it is probable that Jesus himself was deeply influenced by Isaiah. Thus many of the Isaiah passages that are familiar to Christians gained their popularity not directly from Isaiah but from the use of them by Jesus and the early Christian authors – this is especially true of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a>, which depends heavily on Isaiah for its language and imagery.

Bilinear map

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a bilinear map is a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> combining elements of two <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s to yield an element of a third vector space, and is <a href="Linear%20map">linear</a> in each of its arguments. <a href="Matrix%20multiplication">Matrix multiplication</a> is an example.

Let "V", "W" and "X" be three <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s over the same base <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> "F". A bilinear map is a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a>
such that for any "w" in "W" the map
is a <a href="linear%20map">linear map</a> from "V" to "X", and for any "v" in "V" the map
is a linear map from "W" to "X".

In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed. 

If and we have for all "v", "w" in "V", then we say that "B" is "<a href="symmetric%20function">symmetric</a>".

The case where "X" is the base field "F", and we have a <a href="bilinear%20form">bilinear form</a>, is particularly useful (see for example <a href="scalar%20product">scalar product</a>, <a href="inner%20product">inner product</a> and <a href="quadratic%20form">quadratic form</a>).

The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field "F", we use <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a>s over a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> "R". It generalizes to "n"-ary functions, where the proper term is "<a href="Multilinear%20map">multilinear</a>".

For non-commutative rings "R" and "S", a left "R"-module "M" and a right "S"-module "N", a bilinear map is a map with "T" an -<a href="bimodule">bimodule</a>, and for which any "n" in "N", is an "R"-module homomorphism, and for any "m" in "M", is an "S"-module homomorphism. This satisfies

for all "m" in "M", "n" in "N", "r" in "R" and "s" in "S", as well as "B" being <a href="Additive%20map">additive</a> in each argument.

A first immediate consequence of the definition is that whenever or . This may be seen by writing the <a href="zero%20vector">zero vector</a> 0 as (and similarly for 0) and moving the scalar 0 "outside", in front of "B", by linearity.

The set of all bilinear maps is a <a href="linear%20subspace">linear subspace</a> of the space (<a href="viz.">viz.</a> <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>, <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a>) of all maps from into "X".

Blind Blake

Arthur "Blind" Blake (1896 – December 1, 1934) was an American <a href="blues">blues</a> and <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a> singer and guitarist. He is known for numerous recordings he made for <a href="Paramount%20Records">Paramount Records</a> between 1926 and 1932.

Little is known of Blake's life. Promotional materials from <a href="Paramount%20Records">Paramount Records</a> indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, and it seems that he lived there during various periods. He seems to have had relatives in <a href="Patterson%2C%20Georgia">Patterson, Georgia</a>. Some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a <a href="Geechee">Geechee</a> or <a href="Gullah">Gullah</a> dialect, suggesting a connection with the <a href="Sea%20Islands">Sea Islands</a>. <a href="Blind%20Willie%20McTell">Blind Willie McTell</a> indicated that Blake's real name was Arthur Phelps, but later research has shown this is unlikely to be correct. In 2011 a group of researchers led by Alex van der Tuuk published various documents regarding Blake's life and death in the journal "Blues & Rhythm". One of these documents is his 1934 death certificate, which states he was born in 1896 in <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>, to Winter and Alice Blake (his mother's name is followed by a question mark). Nothing else is known of Blake until the 1920s, when he emerged as a recording musician.

Blake recorded about 80 tracks for <a href="Paramount%20Records">Paramount Records</a> from 1926 to 1932. He was one of the most accomplished guitarists of his genre and played a diverse range of material. He is best known for his distinct guitar playing, which was comparable in sound and style to <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a> piano. He seems to have lived in Jacksonville and to have gone to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> for his recording sessions, at one point having an apartment at 31st Street and Cottage Grove. According to van der Tuuk et al., he apparently returned to Florida for the winter. In the 1930s he was reported to be playing in front of a Jacksonville hotel.

Blake married Beatrice McGee around 1931. In the following year he made his final recording at the Paramount headquarters, in <a href="Grafton%2C%20Wisconsin">Grafton, Wisconsin</a>, just before the label went out of business. For decades nothing was known of him after this point, and it was rumored that he met with a violent death; <a href="Reverend%20Gary%20Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a> heard he had been hit by a <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> in 1934. The research of van der Tuuk et al. suggests that Blake stayed in Wisconsin, living in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>'s <a href="Brewer%27s%20Hill%20%28Milwaukee%29">Brewer's Hill</a> neighborhood, where Paramount boarded many of its artists. He seems not to have found work as a musician. In April 1933 he was hospitalized with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and never fully recovered. On December 1, 1934, after three weeks of decline, Beatrice Blake summoned an ambulance. He suffered a <a href="pulmonary%20hemorrhage">pulmonary hemorrhage</a> and died on the way to the hospital. The cause of death was listed as <a href="pulmonary%20tuberculosis">pulmonary tuberculosis</a>. He was buried in Glen Oaks Cemetery, in <a href="Glendale%2C%20Wisconsin">Glendale, Wisconsin</a>.

Blake's first recordings were made in 1926, and his <a href="Gramophone%20record">records</a> sold well. His first solo record was "Early Morning Blues", with "West Coast Blues" on the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a>. Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and were prototypes for the burgeoning <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a>. Blake made his last recordings in 1932; his career ended with Paramount's bankruptcy. Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow have suggested it is possible that only one side of Blake's last record is actually by him; "Champagne Charlie Is My Name" does not sound like Blake's playing or singing.

His complex and intricate fingerpicking inspired <a href="Reverend%20Gary%20Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a>, <a href="Jorma%20Kaukonen">Jorma Kaukonen</a>, <a href="Ry%20Cooder">Ry Cooder</a>, <a href="Arlen%20Roth">Arlen Roth</a>, <a href="John%20Fahey%20%28musician%29">John Fahey</a>, <a href="Ralph%20McTell">Ralph McTell</a>, <a href="Leon%20Redbone">Leon Redbone</a> and many others.

The title track of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s 1992 album "<a href="Good%20As%20I%20Been%20to%20You">Good As I Been to You</a>" is a cover of Blind Blake's "You Gonna Quit Me Blues."

The French singer-songwriter <a href="Francis%20Cabrel">Francis Cabrel</a> refers to Blake in the song "Cent Ans de Plus", on the 1999 album "Hors-Saison."


Blake figures in the plot of <a href="Lee%20Child">Lee Child</a>'s 1997 Jack Reacher novel, "<a href="Killing%20Floor%20%28novel%29">Killing Floor</a>", and there are references to him in Child's 2011 prequel, "<a href="The%20Affair%20%28novel%29">The Affair</a>".

Brian Charles Lara, <a href="Trinity%20Cross">TC</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20Community">OCC</a>, <a href="Honorary%20Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">AM</a> (born 2 May 1969) is a <a href="Trinidadian">Trinidadian</a> former international <a href="cricket">cricket</a> player. He is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He topped the <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> batting <a href="LG%20ICC%20cricket%20ratings">rankings</a> on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>, with 501 not out for <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> at <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a> in 1994, which is the only quintuple hundred in first-class cricket history.

Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a Test innings after scoring 400 not out against England at <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a> in 2004. He is the only batsman to have ever scored a century, a double century, a triple century, a quadruple century and a quintuple century in first class games over the course of a senior career. Lara also shares the test record of scoring the highest number of runs in a single over in a Test match, when he scored 28 runs off an over by <a href="Robin%20Peterson">Robin Peterson</a> of South Africa in 2003 (matched in 2013 by <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s <a href="George%20Bailey%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201982%29">George Bailey</a>).

Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in <a href="Bridgetown">Bridgetown</a>, <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a> in 1999 has been rated by <a href="Wisden">Wisden</a> as the second best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by Sir <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> in <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a> Test match of 1937. <a href="Muttiah%20Muralitharan">Muttiah Muralitharan</a>, rated as the greatest <a href="Test%20cricket">Test match</a> <a href="bowler%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a> ever by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>",<ref name="bbc-12/13/02"></ref> and the highest wicket-taker in both <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> and in <a href="One%20Day%20Internationals">One Day Internationals</a> (ODIs), has hailed Lara as his toughest opponent among all batsmen in the world. Lara was awarded the <a href="Wisden%20Leading%20Cricketer%20in%20the%20World">Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World</a> awards in 1994 and 1995 and is also one of only three cricketers to receive the prestigious <a href="BBC%20Overseas%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year">BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year</a>, the other two being <a href="Sir%20Garfield%20Sobers">Sir Garfield Sobers</a> and <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a>.

Brian Lara was appointed honorary member of the <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Order of Australia</a> on 27 November 2009. On 14 September 2012 he was inducted to the <a href="ICC%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">ICC's Hall of Fame</a> at the awards ceremony held in Colombo, Sri Lanka as a 2012–13 season inductee along with Australians <a href="Glenn%20McGrath">Glenn McGrath</a> and former England women all-rounder <a href="Enid%20Bakewell">Enid Bakewell</a>. In 2013, Lara received Honorary Life Membership of the MCC becoming the 31st West Indian to receive the honor.

Brian Lara is popularly nicknamed as "The Prince of Port of Spain" or simply "The Prince". He has the dubious distinction of playing in the second highest number of test matches (63) in which his team was on the losing side, just behind <a href="Shivnarine%20Chanderpaul">Shivnarine Chanderpaul</a> (68).

Brian was 1 of 11 children. His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to <a href="Fatima%20College">Fatima College</a> where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.

1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by <a href="Carl%20Hooper">Carl Hooper</a> set the previous year. He captained the tournament-winning Trinidad and Tobago, who profited from a match-winning 116 from Lara.

In January 1988, Lara made his first-class debut for <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago%20cricket%20team">Trinidad and Tobago</a> in the <a href="Red%20Stripe%20Cup">Red Stripe Cup</a> against <a href="Leeward%20Islands%20cricket%20team">Leeward Islands</a>. In his second first-class match he made 92 against a <a href="Barbados%20cricket%20team">Barbados</a> attack containing <a href="Joel%20Garner">Joel Garner</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20Marshall">Malcolm Marshall</a>, two greats of <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> teams. Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi-finals. Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20the%20West%20Indies%20in%201988%E2%80%9389">touring Indian team</a> further elevated his reputation.

His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> and scored 145.

In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day <a href="Geddes%20Grant%20Shield">Geddes Grant Shield</a>. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against <a href="Pakistani%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a>, scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.

In January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus Australia in Sydney. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2–1. Lara went on to name his daughter Sydney after scoring 277 at SCG.

Lara holds several world records for high scoring. He has the highest individual score in both <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> (501 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> for <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against <a href="English%20cricket%20team">England</a> in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were <a href="Roger%20Twose">Roger Twose</a> (115 partnership – 2nd wicket), <a href="Trevor%20Penney">Trevor Penney</a> (314 – 3rd), <a href="Paul%20Smith%20%28cricketer%29">Paul Smith</a> (51 – 4th) and <a href="Keith%20John%20Piper">Keith Piper</a> (322 unbroken – 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.

He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until <a href="Matthew%20Hayden">Matthew Hayden</a>'s 380 against <a href="Zimbabwean%20cricket%20team">Zimbabwe</a> in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player (after <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and <a href="Kumar%20Sangakkara">Kumar Sangakkara</a>'s eleven. As a captain, he scored five double centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2–2. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking <a href="Allan%20Border">Allan Border</a> in an innings of 226 played at <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, Australia in November 2005. This would be later broken by <a href="Sachin%20Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> of <a href="India">India</a> on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the <a href="Border-Gavaskar%20Trophy">Border-Gavaskar Trophy</a> 2008.

Lara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. Following this they played <a href="Australia%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> in a four-Test series which was drawn 2–2, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.

The <a href="Wisden%20100">Wisden 100</a> rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998–99 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936–37.

In 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty – including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test Match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to.

Lara was reappointed as captain against the touring <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australians</a> in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1–0 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy.

In March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal <a href="Cable%20%26amp%3B%20Wireless%20%28Caribbean%29">Cable & Wireless</a> sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, <a href="Digicel">Digicel</a>. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars <a href="Chris%20Gayle">Chris Gayle</a>, <a href="Ramnaresh%20Sarwan">Ramnaresh Sarwan</a> and <a href="Dwayne%20Bravo">Dwayne Bravo</a>. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals. The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team">South African team</a>.

Lara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly appointed <a href="Shivnarine%20Chanderpaul">Shivnarine Chanderpaul</a>. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one-day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at <a href="Kensington%20Oval">Kensington Oval</a>, <a href="Bridgetown">Bridgetown</a>, Barbados which the West Indies eventually won.

On 26 April 2006 Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time. This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months – in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the finals of the DLF Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy where they finished runners up in both finals.

On 16 December 2006 he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs. along with <a href="Sachin%20Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> one of only two players, at the time, to do so in both forms of the game. On 10 April 2007 Lara confirmed his retirement from one day cricket post the <a href="2007%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2007 Cricket World Cup</a>. A few days later he announced that he would in fact be retiring from all international cricket after the tournament.

Lara played his final international game on 21 April 2007 in a <a href="dead%20rubber">dead rubber</a> World Cup game against England. He was run out for 18 after a mix up with Marlon Samuels; England won the game by 1 wicket. Before the end of this World Cup Glenn McGrath stated that Lara is the greatest batsman that he has ever bowled to.

On 19 April 2007 Lara announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket, indicating that the West Indies vs England match on 21 April 2007 would be his last international appearance. He was run out after a bad mixup with <a href="Marlon%20Samuels">Marlon Samuels</a> for 18, as England went on to win the match by one wicket.

He announced before the 2007 Cricket World Cup that this would be his last appearance in One Day Internationals. After his last match, in the post-game presentation interview, he asked the fans, "Did I entertain?", to which he received a resounding cheer from the crowd, after which he went out and took his 'lap of honour' where he met and shook hands with many of the fans. Lara stated this would be his last appearance in international cricket, he has also indicated his interest in retaining some involvement in the sport.

On 23 July 2007 Lara agreed to sign for the <a href="Indian%20Cricket%20League">Indian Cricket League</a>. He is the former captain of the <a href="Mumbai%20Champs">Mumbai Champs</a>. He volunteered to play for his home team Trinidad during the start of 2008 domestic season. He had not played for Trinidad for the last two years. He made his comeback a memorable one with a match winning hundred over Guyana, followed by a dismissive undefeated half-century in the second innings, scored at over two runs per ball. In the third-round game (Trinidad got a bye in the second round).

Lara suffered a fractured arm against the Leeward Islands in St Maarten on 19 January, which kept him out of the ICL season. He nevertheless affirmed his commitment to returning to Twenty20 cricket, and on 27 June 2010 appeared for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> match against a touring Pakistan team, scoring 37 from 32 balls.

In 2013, Lara became involved with the <a href="Bangladesh%20Premier%20League">Bangladesh Premier League</a> team <a href="Chittagong%20Kings">Chittagong Kings</a> as their ambassador.

On the occasion of bicentennial anniversary of Lord's ground he played for the team of MCC, under the leadership of Sachin Tendulkar against the Rest of World XI in a 50 over game.

After negotiations between <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and Lara for the <a href="2010%20Friends%20Provident%20t20">2010 Friends Provident t20</a> failed to come to anything, Lara declared that he still wanted to sign a contract to play <a href="Twenty20">Twenty20</a> cricket. Late in the year he joined <a href="Southern%20Rocks">Southern Rocks</a>, a <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>an side, to compete in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Stanbic%20Bank%2020%20Series">2010–11 Stanbic Bank 20 Series</a>. On his debut for the Rocks, and his first-ever Twenty20 match, he scored a half-century, top-scoring for the Rocks with 65. He added 34 runs in his next two innings, but then left the competition, citing "commitments elsewhere".

After expressing his interest to play in the 2011 fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and despite not having played active cricket for four years, Brian Lara still managed to attract the highest reserve price of $400,000 ahead of the IPL players' auction in early January 2011; however, no franchise bought him.

In July 2014, he played for the MCC side in the <a href="Bicentenary%20Celebration%20match">Bicentenary Celebration match</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>.

As the batsman started to walk back, captain <a href="Rahul%20Dravid">Rahul Dravid</a> declared the innings. The confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder had stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, Lara, the captain of the West Indies side, felt that Dhoni should walk off, based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for more than 15 minutes. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid's declaration was effected, although the game was delayed. Lara was called by the match referee for an explanation of his actions but was not fined.

In March 2015, Lara criticised the ICC for fining Pakistani cricket player <a href="Wahab%20Riaz">Wahab Riaz</a> after his 'shocking spell', as it was dubbed, when he managed to puzzle Australian player <a href="Shane%20Watson">Shane Watson</a> by giving him sarcastic claps, throwing the ball at him and sending him flying kisses. Watson was unable to cope with that and Riaz's high-quality bowling in the <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 ICC World Cup</a>. The team lost but Riaz was fined 50% of his match fee for his behaviour. Lara criticised this decision by the ICC and said it was 'uncalled for'. He said it was the only highlights of the game and said he would pay the fine himself. He said he wanted to meet Riaz himself.
