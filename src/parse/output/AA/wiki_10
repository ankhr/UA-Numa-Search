APL (programming language)

APL (named after the book "A Programming Language") is a <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> developed in the 1960s by <a href="Kenneth%20E.%20Iverson">Kenneth E. Iverson</a>. Its central datatype is the <a href="Array%20data%20type%23Multi-dimensional%20arrays">multidimensional array</a>. It uses a large range of <a href="APL_syntax_and_symbols">special graphic symbols</a> to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a>s, <a href="functional%20programming">functional programming</a>, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages. It is still used today for certain applications.

The <a href="mathematical%20notation">mathematical notation</a> for manipulating arrays which developed into the APL programming language was developed by Iverson at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> starting in 1957, and published in his "A Programming Language" in 1962.
The preface states its premise:
Applied mathematics is largely concerned with the design and analysis of explicit procedures for calculating the exact or approximate values of various functions. Such explicit procedures are called algorithms or "programs". Because an effective notation for the description of programs exhibits considerable syntactic structure, it is called a "programming language".
In 1960, he began work for <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and, working with <a href="Adin%20Falkoff">Adin Falkoff</a>, created APL based on the notation he had developed. This notation was used inside IBM for short research reports on computer systems, such as the <a href="Burroughs%20B5000">Burroughs B5000</a> and its stack mechanism when stack machines versus <a href="register%20machine">register machine</a>s were being evaluated by IBM for upcoming computers.

Also in 1960, Iverson used his notation in a draft of the chapter "A Programming Language", written for a book he was writing with <a href="Fred%20Brooks">Fred Brooks</a>, "Automatic Data Processing", which would be published in 1963.

As early as 1962, the first attempt to use the notation to describe a complete computer system happened after Falkoff discussed with Dr. William C. Carter his work in the standardization of the instruction set for the machines that later became the <a href="IBM%20System/360">IBM System/360</a> family.

In 1963, Herbert Hellerman, working at the IBM Systems Research Institute, implemented a part of the notation on an <a href="IBM%201620">IBM 1620</a> computer, and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation. Students tested their code in Hellerman's lab. This implementation of a portion of the notation was called PAT (Personalized Array Translator).

In 1963, Falkoff, Iverson, and <a href="Edward%20H.%20Sussenguth%20Jr.">Edward H. Sussenguth Jr.</a>, all working at IBM, used the notation for a formal description of the <a href="IBM%20System/360">IBM System/360</a> series machine architecture and functionality, which resulted in a paper published in "<a href="IBM%20Systems%20Journal">IBM Systems Journal</a>" in 1964. After this was published, the team turned their attention to an implementation of the notation on a computer system. One of the motivations for this focus of implementation was the interest of John L. Lawrence who had new duties with <a href="Science%20Research%20Associates">Science Research Associates</a>, an educational company bought by IBM in 1964. Lawrence asked Iverson and his group to help utilize the language as a tool for the development and use of computers in education.

After <a href="Lawrence%20M.%20Breed">Lawrence M. Breed</a> and <a href="Philip%20S.%20Abrams">Philip S. Abrams</a> of Stanford University joined the team at IBM Research, they continued their prior work on an implementation programmed in <a href="FORTRAN%20IV">FORTRAN IV</a> for a portion of the notation which had been done for the <a href="IBM%207090">IBM 7090</a> computer running under the <a href="IBM%207090/94%20IBSYS">IBSYS</a> operating system. This work was finished in late 1965 and later known as IVSYS (Iverson System). The basis of this implementation was described in detail by Abrams in a Stanford University Technical Report, "An Interpreter for Iverson Notation" in 1966. this was formally supervised by <a href="Niklaus%20Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a>. Like Hellerman's PAT system earlier, this implementation did not include the APL character set but used special English reserved words for functions and operators. The system was later adapted for a <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a> system and, by November 1966, it had been reprogrammed for the <a href="IBM%20System/360%20Model%2050">IBM System/360 Model 50</a> computer running in a time sharing mode and was used internally at IBM.

A key development in the ability to use APL effectively, before the widespread use of <a href="Computer%20monitor%23Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a> terminals, was the development of a special <a href="IBM%20Selectric%20typewriter">IBM Selectric typewriter</a> interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the <a href="IBM%201050">IBM 1050</a> and <a href="IBM%202741">IBM 2741</a> terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and not be forced to use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.

Some APL symbols, even with the APL characters on the typeball, still had to be typed in by over-striking two existing typeball characters. An example is the "grade up" character, which had to be made from a "delta" (shift-H) and a "<a href="Sheffer%20stroke">Sheffer stroke</a>" (shift-M). This was necessary because the APL character set was larger than the 88 characters allowed on the Selectric typeball.

The first APL interactive login and creation of an APL workspace was in 1966 by Larry Breed using an IBM 1050 terminal at the IBM Mohansic Labs near <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Watson%20Research%20Center">Thomas J. Watson Research Center</a>, the home of APL, in <a href="Yorktown%20Heights%2C%20New%20York">Yorktown Heights, New York</a>.

IBM was chiefly responsible for the introduction of APL to the marketplace. APL was first available in 1967 for the <a href="IBM%201130">IBM 1130</a> as "APL\1130". It would run in as little as 8k 16-bit words of memory, and used a dedicated 1 megabyte hard disk.

APL gained its foothold on mainframe timesharing systems from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, in part because it would run on lower-specification systems that were not equipped with <a href="Memory%20management%20unit">Dynamic Address Translation</a> hardware. Additional improvements in performance for selected <a href="IBM%20System/370">IBM System/370</a> mainframe systems included the "APL Assist Microcode" in which some support for APL execution was included in the actual firmware as opposed to APL being exclusively a software product. Somewhat later, as suitably performing hardware was finally becoming available in the mid- to late-1980s, many users migrated their applications to the personal computer environment.

Early IBM APL interpreters for IBM 360 and IBM 370 hardware implemented their own multi-user management instead of relying on the host services, thus they were timesharing systems in their own right. First introduced in 1966, the "APL\360" system was a multi-user interpreter. The ability to programmatically communicate with the operating system for information and setting interpreter system variables was done through special privileged "I-beam" functions, using both <a href="Monad%20%28functional%20programming%29">monadic</a> and <a href="Dyadics">dyadic</a> operations.

In 1973, IBM released "APL.SV", which was a continuation of the same product, but which offered <a href="shared%20variable">shared variable</a>s as a means to access facilities outside of the APL system, such as operating system files. In the mid-1970s, the IBM mainframe interpreter was even adapted for use on the <a href="IBM%205100">IBM 5100</a> desktop computer, which had a small CRT and an APL keyboard, when most other small computers of the time only offered <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a>. In the 1980s, the "VSAPL" program product enjoyed widespread usage with <a href="Conversational%20Monitor%20System">CMS</a>, <a href="Time%20Sharing%20Option">TSO</a>, <a href="VSPC">VSPC</a>, <a href="MUSIC/SP">MUSIC/SP</a> and <a href="CICS">CICS</a> users.

In 1973-1974, Dr. Patrick E. Hagerty directed the implementation of the University of Maryland APL interpreter for the <a href="UNIVAC%201100/2200%20series">Sperry Univac 1100</a> Series mainframe computers. At the time, Sperry had nothing. In 1974, student Alan Stebbens was assigned the task of implementing an internal function.

Several timesharing firms sprang up in the 1960s and 1970s that sold APL services using modified versions of the IBM APL\360 interpreter. In North America, the better-known ones were <a href="I.%20P.%20Sharp%20Associates">I. P. Sharp Associates</a>, <a href="Scientific%20Time%20Sharing%20Corporation">STSC</a>, <a href="Time%20Sharing%20Resources">Time Sharing Resources</a> (TSR) and <a href="The%20Computer%20Company">The Computer Company</a> (TCC). CompuServe also entered the fray in 1978 with an APL Interpreter based on a modified version of Digital Equipment Corp and Carnegie Mellon's which ran on DEC's KI and KL 36 bit machines. CompuServe's APL was available both to its commercial market and the consumer information service. With the advent first of less expensive mainframes such as the <a href="IBM%204300">IBM 4300</a> and later the personal computer, the timesharing industry had all but disappeared by the mid-1980s.

"Sharp APL" was available from <a href="I.%20P.%20Sharp%20Associates">I. P. Sharp Associates</a>, first on a timesharing basis in the 1960s, and later as a program product starting around 1979. "Sharp APL" was an advanced APL implementation with many language extensions, such as "packages" (the ability to put one or more objects into a single variable), file system, nested arrays, and <a href="shared%20variable">shared variable</a>s.

APL interpreters were available from other mainframe and mini-computer manufacturers as well, notably <a href="Burroughs%20Corporation">Burroughs</a>, <a href="Control%20Data%20Corporation">CDC</a>, <a href="Data%20General">Data General</a>, <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a>, <a href="Harris%20Corporation">Harris</a>, <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>, <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens AG</a>, <a href="Xerox">Xerox</a>, and others.

<a href="Garth%20Foster">Garth Foster</a> of <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> sponsored regular meetings of the APL implementers' community at Syracuse's Minnowbrook Conference Center in <a href="Blue%20Mountain%20Lake%2C%20New%20York">Blue Mountain Lake, New York</a>. In later years, Eugene McDonnell organized similar meetings at the <a href="Asilomar%20Conference%20Grounds">Asilomar Conference Grounds</a> near Monterey, California, and at Pajaro Dunes near Watsonville, California. The SIGAPL special interest group of the <a href="Association%20for%20Computing%20Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery</a> continues to support the APL community.

In 1979, Iverson received the <a href="Turing%20Award">Turing Award</a> for his work on APL.

Filmography, Videos: Over the years APL has been the subject of more than a few films and videos. Some of these include:

Starting in the early 1980s, IBM APL development, under the leadership of Dr <a href="Jim%20Brown%20%28Computer%20Scientist%29">Jim Brown</a>, implemented a new version of the APL language that contained as its primary enhancement the concept of "nested arrays", where an array can contain other arrays, as well as new language features which facilitated the integration of nested arrays into program workflow. Ken Iverson, no longer in control of the development of the APL language, left IBM and joined <a href="I.%20P.%20Sharp%20Associates">I. P. Sharp Associates</a>, where one of his major contributions was directing the evolution of Sharp APL to be more in accordance with his vision.

As other vendors were busy developing APL interpreters for new hardware, notably <a href="Unix">Unix</a>-based <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s, APL2 was almost always the standard chosen for new APL interpreter developments. Even today, most APL vendors or their users cite APL2 compatibility, as a selling point for those products.

"APL2" for IBM mainframe computers is still available. IBM cites its use for problem solving, system design, prototyping, engineering and scientific computations, expert systems, for teaching mathematics and other subjects, visualization and database access and was first available for <a href="Conversational%20Monitor%20System">CMS</a> and <a href="Time%20Sharing%20Option">TSO</a> in 1984. The APL2 Workstation edition (Windows, OS/2, AIX, Linux, and Solaris) followed much later in the early 1990s.

The first microcomputer implementation of APL was on the <a href="Intel%208008">Intel 8008</a>-based <a href="MCM/70">MCM/70</a>, the first general purpose personal computer, in 1973. Size of arrays along any dimension could not be larger than 255 and the machine was quite slow, but very convenient for education purposes. Interestingly, a significant percentage of sales was to small businesses, who found it more cost effective and accessible than the time sharing services that were available at the time, and for whom the array size limitations were not a barrier.

IBM's own <a href="IBM%205100">IBM 5100</a> microcomputer (1975) offered APL as one of two built-in ROM-based interpreted languages for the computer, complete with a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language. While the 5100 was very slow and operated its screen only like a typewriter, its follower the 5110 had more acceptable performances and a read-write addressable text screen. Graphics could be printed on an external matrix printer.

In 1976 DNA Systems introduced an APL interpreter for their TSO Operating System, which ran timesharing on the IBM 1130, Digital Scientific Meta-4, General Automation GA 18/30 and Computer Hardware CHI 21/30.

The <a href="VideoBrain%20Family%20Computer">VideoBrain Family Computer</a>, released in 1977, only had one programming language available for it, and that was a dialect of APL called APL/S.

A Small APL for the <a href="Intel">Intel</a> 8080 called EMPL was released in 1977, and Softronics APL, with most of the functions of full APL, for 8080-based CP/M systems was released in 1979.

In 1977, the Canadian firm Telecompute Integrated Systems, Inc. released a business-oriented APL interpreter known as TIS APL, for Z80-based systems. It featured the full set of file functions for APL, plus a full screen input and switching of right and left arguments for most dyadic operators by introducing the codice_1 prefix to all single character dyadic functions such as codice_2 or codice_3.

Vanguard APL was available for <a href="Z80">Z80</a> <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a>-based processors in the late 1970s. <a href="The%20Computer%20Company">TCC</a> released APL.68000 in the early 1980s for Motorola <a href="68000">68000</a>-based processors, this system being the basis for MicroAPL Limited's <a href="APLX">APLX</a> product. I. P. Sharp Associates released a version of their APL interpreter for the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> and <a href="PC-XT/370">PC-XT/370</a>. For the IBM PC, an <a href="emulator">emulator</a> was written that facilitated reusing much of the IBM 370 mainframe code. Arguably, the best known APL interpreter for the IBM Personal Computer was <a href="Scientific%20Time%20Sharing%20Corporation">STSC</a>'s APL*Plus/PC.

The <a href="Commodore%20SuperPET">Commodore SuperPET</a>, introduced in 1981, included an APL interpreter developed by the <a href="University%20of%20Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a>.

In the early 1980s, the Analogic Corporation developed "The APL Machine", which was an <a href="vector%20processor">array processing</a> computer designed to be programmed only in APL. There were actually three processing units, the user's workstation, an <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>, where programs were entered and edited, a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> processor that ran the APL interpreter, and the Analogic array processor that executed the primitives. At the time of its introduction, The APL Machine was likely the fastest APL system available. Although a technological success, The APL Machine was a marketing failure. The initial version supported a single process at a time. At the time the project was discontinued, the design had been completed to allow multiple users. As an aside, an unusual aspect of The APL Machine was that the library of workspaces was organized such that a single function or variable that was shared by many workspaces existed only once in the library. Several of the members of The APL Machine project had previously spent a number of years with Burroughs implementing "APL\700".

At one stage, it was claimed by Bill Gates in his <a href="Open%20Letter%20to%20Hobbyists">Open Letter to Hobbyists</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Corporation">Microsoft Corporation</a> planned to release a version of APL, but these plans never materialized.

An early 1978 publication of <a href="Rodnay%20Zaks">Rodnay Zaks</a> from <a href="Sybex">Sybex</a> was "A microprogrammed APL implementation" , which is the complete source listing for the microcode for a Digital Scientific Corporation Meta 4 microprogrammable processor implementing APL. This topic was also the subject of his PhD thesis.

In 1979, <a href="William%20Yerazunis">William Yerazunis</a> wrote a partial version of APL in <a href="Prime%20Computer">Prime Computer</a> FORTRAN, extended it with graphics primitives, and released it. This was also the subject of his Masters thesis.

Various implementations of APL by APLX, Dyalog, et al., include extensions for <a href="object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented programming</a>, support for <a href=".NET%20Framework">.NET</a>, XML-array conversion primitives, graphing, operating system interfaces, and <a href="lambda%20expressions">lambda expressions</a>.

Unlike traditionally structured programming languages, APL code is typically structured as chains of <a href="unary%20operation">monadic</a> or <a href="binary%20operation">dyadic</a> <a href="function%20%28programming%29">functions</a>, and <a href="higher-order%20function">operators</a> acting on <a href="array%20data%20type">arrays</a>. APL has many nonstandard "primitives" (functions and operators) that are indicated by a single symbol or a combination of a few symbols. All primitives are defined to have the same <a href="operator%20precedence">precedence</a>, and always associate to the right; hence APL is "read" or best understood from <a href="APL%20syntax%20and%20symbols%23Syntax%20rules">right-to-left</a>.

"Early" APL implementations (circa 1970 or so) did not have programming loop-<a href="control%20flow">flow control structures</a>, such as "do" or "while" loops, and "if-then-else" constructions. Instead, they used array operations, and use of <a href="structured%20programming">structured programming</a> constructs was often not necessary, since an operation could be carried out on an entire array in a single statement. For example, the "iota" function ("ι") can replace for-loop <a href="iteration">iteration</a>: ιN when applied to a scalar positive integer yields a one-dimensional array (vector), 1 2 3 ... N. More recent implementations of APL generally include comprehensive control structures, so that data structure and program control flow can be clearly and cleanly separated.

The APL environment is called a "workspace". In a workspace the user can define programs and data, i.e. the data values exist also outside the programs, and the user can also manipulate the data without having to define a program. In the examples below, the APL interpreter first types six spaces before awaiting the user's input. Its own output starts in column one.
The user can save the workspace with all values, programs, and execution status.

APL is well known for its use of a set of non-<a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> symbols, which are an extension of traditional arithmetic and algebraic notation. Having single character names for <a href="SIMD">SIMD</a> vector functions is one way that APL enables compact formulation of algorithms for data transformation such as computing <a href="Conway%27s%20Game%20of%20Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> in one line of code. In nearly all versions of APL, it is theoretically possible to express any computable function in one expression, that is, in one line of code.

Because of the unusual <a href="character%20set">character set</a>, many programmers use special <a href="computer%20keyboard">keyboards</a> with APL keytops to write APL code. Although there are various ways to write APL code using only ASCII characters, in practice it is almost never done. (This may be thought to support Iverson's thesis about <a href="Linguistic%20relativity">notation as a tool of thought</a>.) Most if not all modern implementations use standard keyboard layouts, with special mappings or <a href="input%20method%20editor">input method editor</a>s to access non-ASCII characters. Historically, the APL font has been distinctive, with uppercase italic alphabetic characters and upright numerals and symbols. Most vendors continue to display the APL character set in a custom font.

Advocates of APL claim that the examples of so-called "write-only code" (badly written and almost incomprehensible code) are almost invariably examples of poor programming practice or novice mistakes, which can occur in any language. Advocates of APL also claim that they are far more productive with APL than with more conventional computer languages, and that working software can be implemented in far less time and with far fewer programmers than using other technology.

They also may claim that because it is compact and terse, APL lends itself well to larger-scale software development and complexity, because the number of lines of code can be dramatically reduced. Many APL advocates and practitioners also view standard programming languages such as <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> and <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> as being comparatively tedious. APL is often found where time-to-market is important, such as with trading systems.

Iverson later designed the "<a href="J%20programming%20language">J programming language</a>", which uses <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> with <a href="digraph%20%28computing%29">digraphs</a> instead of special symbols.

Because APL's core objects are arrays, it lends itself well to <a href="Data%20parallelism">parallelism</a>, <a href="parallel%20computing">parallel computing</a>, <a href="Massively%20parallel%20%28computing%29">massively parallel</a> applications, and <a href="Very-large-scale%20integration">very-large-scale integration or VLSI</a>.

APLNext (formerly APL2000) offers an advanced APL interpreter that operates under Linux, Unix, and Windows. It supports Windows automation, supports calls to operating system and user defined DLLs, has an advanced APL File System, and represents the current level of APL language development. APL2000's product is an advanced continuation of <a href="Scientific%20Time%20Sharing%20Corporation">STSC</a>'s successful APL*Plus/PC and APL*Plus/386 product line.

"Dyalog APL" is an advanced APL interpreter that operates under <a href="AIX">AIX</a>, <a href="Linux">Linux</a> (including on the <a href="Raspberry%20Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>), <a href="macOS">macOS</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. Dyalog has extensions to the APL language, which include new <a href="Object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented</a> features, numerous language enhancements, plus a consistent <a href="namespace">namespace</a> model used for both its Microsoft Automation interface, as well as native <a href="namespace">namespace</a>s. For the Windows platform, Dyalog APL offers tight integration with .NET, plus limited integration with the Microsoft Visual Studio development platform.

IBM offers a version of IBM APL2 for IBM AIX, Linux, Sun Solaris and Windows systems. This product is a continuation of APL2 offered for IBM mainframes. IBM APL2 was arguably the most influential APL system, which provided a solid implementation standard for the next set of extensions to the language, focusing on nested arrays.

NARS2000 is an open-source APL interpreter written by Bob Smith, a well-known APL developer and implementor from <a href="STSC">STSC</a> in the 1970s and 1980s. NARS2000 contains advanced features and new datatypes, runs natively under Windows (32- and 64-bit versions), and runs under <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and Apple <a href="macOS">macOS</a> with <a href="Wine%20%28software%29">Wine</a>.

MicroAPL Limited offers <a href="APLX">APLX</a>, a full-featured 64 bit interpreter for <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="macOS">macOS</a> systems. The core language is closely modelled on IBM's APL2 with various enhancements. "APLX" includes close integration with <a href=".NET">.NET</a>, <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a>, <a href="Ruby%20%28programming%20language%29">Ruby</a> and <a href="R%20%28programming%20language%29">R</a>. Effective July 11, 2016, MicroAPL withdrew APLX from commercial sale. <a href="http%3A//www.dyalog.com">Dyalog</a> began hosting the <a href="http%3A//www.dyalog.com/aplx.htm">APLX website</a> including the download area and documentation.

<a href="Soliton%20Incorporated">Soliton Incorporated</a> offers the SAX interpreter, which stands for "S"harp "A"PL for Uni"X", for Unix and Linux systems. This is a further development of I. P. Sharp Associates' Sharp APL product. Unlike most other APL interpreters, <a href="Kenneth%20E.%20Iverson">Kenneth E. Iverson</a> had some influence in the way nested arrays were implemented in Sharp APL and SAX. Nearly all other APL implementations followed the course set by IBM with APL2, thus some important details in Sharp APL differ from other implementations.

OpenAPL is an open source implementation of APL published by Branko Bratkovic. It is based on code by <a href="Ken%20Thompson">Ken Thompson</a> of Bell Laboratories, together with contributions by others. It is licensed under the <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GNU General Public License</a>, and runs on Unix systems including Linux on x86, SPARC and other CPUs.

GNU APL is a free implementation of ISO Standard 13751 and hence similar to APL2. It runs on GNU/Linux and on Windows using <a href="Cygwin">Cygwin</a>. It uses <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> internally. GNU APL was written by Jürgen Sauermann.

APL programs are normally <a href="interpreted%20language">interpreted</a> and less often <a href="compiled%20language">compiled</a>. In reality, most APL compilers <a href="Translator%20%28computing%29">translated</a> source APL to a lower level language such as <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, leaving the machine-specific details to the lower level compiler. Compilation of APL programs was a frequently discussed topic in conferences. Although some of the newer enhancements to the APL language such as nested arrays have rendered the language increasingly difficult to compile, the idea of APL compilation is still under development today.

In the past, APL compilation was regarded as a means to achieve execution speed comparable to other mainstream languages, especially on mainframe computers. Several APL compilers achieved some levels of success, though comparatively little of the development effort spent on APL over the years went to perfecting compilation into machine code.

As is the case when moving APL programs from one vendor's APL interpreter to another, APL programs invariably will require changes to their content. Depending on the compiler, variable declarations might be needed, certain language features would need to be removed or avoided, or the APL programs would need to be cleaned up in some way. Some features of the language, such as the execute function (an expression evaluator) and the various <a href="reflection%20%28computer%20science%29">reflection</a> and <a href="introspection%20%28computer%20science%29">introspection</a> functions from APL, such as the ability to return a function's text or to materialize a new function from text, are simply not practical to implement in machine code compilation.

A commercial compiler was brought to market by <a href="Scientific%20Time%20Sharing%20Corporation">STSC</a> in the mid-1980s as an add-on to IBM's VSAPL Program Product.
Unlike more modern APL compilers, this product produced machine code that would execute only in the interpreter environment, it was not possible to eliminate the interpreter component. The compiler could compile many scalar and vector operations to machine code, but it would rely on the APL interpreter's services to perform some more advanced functions, rather than attempt to compile them. However, dramatic speedups did occur, especially for heavily iterative APL code.

Around the same time, the book "An APL Compiler" by <a href="Timothy%20Budd">Timothy Budd</a> appeared in print. This book detailed the construction of an APL <a href="Translator%20%28computing%29">translator</a> (aplc), written in <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, which performed certain optimizations such as <a href="loop%20fusion">loop fusion</a> specific to the needs of an array language. The source language was APL-like in that a few rules of the APL language were changed or relaxed to permit more efficient compilation. The translator would emit C code which could then be compiled and run outside of the APL workspace. Another compiler, also named aplc, was later created by Samuel W. Sirlin, based on Budd's work.

The Burroughs/Unisys "APLB" interpreter (1982) was the first to use <a href="Dynamic%20compilation">dynamic</a> <a href="Incremental%20compiler">incremental</a> compilation to produce code for an APL-specific <a href="virtual%20machine">virtual machine</a>. It recompiled on-the-fly as identifiers changed their functional meanings. In addition to removing <a href="parsing">parsing</a> and some error checking from the main execution path, such compilation also streamlines the repeated entry and exit of user-defined functional operands. This avoids the stack setup and take-down for function calls made by APL's built-in operators such as Reduce and Each.

"APEX", a research APL compiler, is available under the <a href="GNU%20Public%20License">GNU Public License</a>, per Snake Island Research Inc. APEX compiles flat APL (a subset of ISO N8485) into <a href="SAC%20programming%20language">SAC</a>, a functional array language with parallel semantics, and currently runs under <a href="Linux">Linux</a>. APEX-generated code uses <a href="loop%20fusion">loop fusion</a> and 'array contraction', special-case algorithms not generally available to interpreters (e.g., upgrade of <a href="Permutation%20matrix">permutation matrix/vector</a>), to achieve a level of performance comparable to that of <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a>.

The APLNext "VisualAPL" system is a departure from a conventional APL system in that VisualAPL is a true .NET language which is fully interoperable with other .NET languages such as <a href="VB.NET">VB.NET</a> and <a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a>. VisualAPL is inherently object-oriented and Unicode-based. While VisualAPL incorporates most of the features of standard APL implementations, the VisualAPL language extends standard APL to be .NET-compliant. VisualAPL is hosted in the standard Microsoft Visual Studio IDE and as such, invokes compilation in a manner identical to that of other .NET languages. By producing <a href="Common%20Intermediate%20Language">Common Intermediate Language</a> (CIL) code, it utilizes the Microsoft just-in-time compiler (JIT) to support 32-bit or 64-bit hardware. Substantial performance speed-ups over standard APL have been reported, especially when (optional) strong typing of function arguments is used.

An APL-to-<a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a> <a href="Translator%20%28computing%29">translator</a> is available from Causeway Graphical Systems. This product was designed to allow the APL code, translated to equivalent C#, to run completely outside of the APL environment. The Causeway compiler requires a run-time library of array functions. Some speedup, sometimes dramatic, is visible, but happens on account of the optimisations inherent in Microsoft's .NET Framework.

APL was unique in the speed with which it could perform complicated matrix operations. For example, a very large matrix multiplication would take only a few seconds on a machine that was much less powerful than those today, ref. and "because it operates on arrays and performs operations like matrix inversion internally, well written APL can be surprisingly fast." There were both technical and economic reasons for this advantage:

Phil Abrams' much-cited paper "An APL Machine" illustrated how APL could make effective use of <a href="lazy%20evaluation">lazy evaluation</a> where calculations would not actually be performed until the results were needed and then only those calculations strictly required. An obvious (and easy to implement) lazy evaluation is the "J-vector": when a monadic "iota" is encountered in the code, it is kept as a representation instead of being expanded in memory; in future operations, a J-vectors contents are the loop's induction register, not reads from memory.

Although such techniques were not widely used by commercial interpreters, they exemplify the language's best survival mechanism: not specifying the order of scalar operations or the exact contents of memory. As standardized, in 1983 by <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">ANSI</a> <a href="working%20group">working group</a> X3J10, APL remains highly <a href="data%20parallelism">data-parallel</a>. This gives language implementers immense freedom to schedule operations as efficiently as possible. As computer innovations such as <a href="cache%20memory">cache memory</a>, and <a href="SIMD">SIMD</a> execution became commercially available, APL programs are ported with almost no extra effort spent re-optimizing low-level details.

APL makes a clear distinction between "functions" and "operators". Functions take arrays (variables or constants or expressions) as arguments, and return arrays as results. Operators (similar to <a href="higher-order%20function">higher-order function</a>s) take functions or arrays as arguments, and derive related functions. For example, the "sum" function is derived by applying the "reduction" operator to the "addition" function. Applying the same reduction operator to the "maximum" function (which returns the larger of two numbers) derives a function which returns the largest of a group (vector) of numbers. In the J language, Iverson substituted the terms "verb" for "function" and "adverb" or "conjunction" for "operator".

APL also identifies those features built into the language, and represented by a symbol, or a fixed combination of symbols, as "primitives". Most primitives are either functions or operators. Coding APL is largely a process of writing non-primitive functions and (in some versions of APL) operators. However a few primitives are considered to be neither functions nor operators, most noticeably assignment.

Some words used in APL literature have meanings that differ from those in both mathematics and the generality of computer science.

APL has explicit representations of functions, operators, and syntax, thus providing a basis for the clear and explicit statement of extended facilities in the language, as well as tools for experimentation upon them.

This displays "<a href="Hello%2C%20world">Hello, world</a>":
'Hello World,' sample user session on YouTube

A design theme in APL is to define default actions in some cases that would produce syntax errors in most other programming languages.

The 'Hello, world' string constant above displays, because display is the default action on any expression for which no action is specified explicitly (e.g. assignment, function parameter).

Another example of this theme is that exponentiation in APL is written as "", which indicates raising 2 to the power 3 (this would be written as "" in some other languages and "" in FORTRAN and Python). However, if no base is specified (as with the statement "" in APL, or "" in other languages), most other programming languages one would have a syntax error. APL however assumes the missing base to be the natural logarithm constant <a href="e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">e</a> (2.71828...), and so interpreting "" as "".

This following immediate-mode expression generates a typical set of "Pick 6" <a href="lottery">lottery</a> numbers: six <a href="pseudo-random">pseudo-random</a> <a href="integer">integer</a>s ranging from 1 to 40, "guaranteed non-repeating", and displays them sorted in ascending order:

The above does a lot, concisely; although it seems complex to a beginning <a href="wiktionary%3AAPLer">APLer</a>. It combines the following APL functions (also called "primitives" and "glyphs"):

Since there is no function to the left of the left-most x to tell APL what to do with the result, it simply outputs it to the display (on a single line, separated by spaces) without needing any explicit instruction to do that.

"?" also has a monadic equivalent called roll, which simply returns a single random integer between 1 and its sole operand [to the right of it], inclusive. Thus, a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> program might use the expression "?20" to roll a twenty-sided die.

The following expression finds all <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s from 1 to R. In both time and space, the calculation complexity is formula_1 (in <a href="Big%20O%20notation">Big O notation</a>).

Executed from right to left, this means:
(Note, this assumes the APL origin is 1, i.e. indices start with 1. APL can be set to use 0 as the origin, so that codice_33 is codice_34, which is convenient for some calculations.)

The following expression <a href="sorting">sorts</a> a word list stored in matrix X according to word length:

The following function "life", written in Dyalog APL, takes a boolean matrix and calculates the new generation according to <a href="Conway%27s%20Game%20of%20Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. It demonstrates the power of APL to implement a complex algorithm in very little code, but it is also very hard to follow unless one has advanced knowledge of APL.

In the following example, also Dyalog, the first line assigns some HTML code to a variable codice_35 and then uses an APL expression to remove all the HTML tags (<a href="http%3A//aplwiki.com/AplIn20Minutes%23Extract_content_from_Code">explanation</a>):

This returns the text <samp>This is emphasized text.</samp>

APL has been both criticized and praised for its choice of a unique, non-standard character set. Some who learn it become ardent adherents, suggesting that there is some weight behind Iverson's idea that the notation used does make a difference. In the beginning, there were few terminal devices and even display monitors that could reproduce the APL character set—the most popular ones employing the <a href="IBM%20Selectric">IBM Selectric</a> print mechanism used with a special APL type element. One of the early APL <a href="Computer%20terminal">line terminals</a> (line-mode operation only, "not" full screen) was the Texas Instruments TI Model 745 (circa 1977) with the full APL character set which featured <a href="Duplex%20%28telecommunications%29">half and full duplex</a> <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a>s modes, for interacting with an APL <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a> service or remote mainframe to run a remote computer job, <a href="Remote%20job%20entry">called an RJE</a>.

Over time, with the universal use of high-quality graphic displays, printing devices and <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> support, the APL character font problem has largely been eliminated. However, entering APL characters requires the use of <a href="input%20method%20editor">input method editor</a>s, keyboard mappings, virtual/on-screen APL symbol sets, or easy-reference printed keyboard cards which can frustrate beginners accustomed to other programming languages. With beginners who have no prior experience with other programming languages, a study involving high school students found that typing and using APL characters did not hinder the students in any measurable way.

In defense of the APL community, APL requires less coding to type in, and keyboard mappings become memorized over time. Also, special APL keyboards are manufactured and in use today, as are freely available downloadable fonts for operating system platforms such as Microsoft Windows. The reported productivity gains assume that one will spend enough time working in APL to make memorization of the symbols, their semantics, and keyboard mappings worthwhile.

APL has long had a select, mathematically inclined and curiosity-driven user base, who reference its powerful and symbolic nature. For example, one symbol/character can perform an entire sort; another can perform regression. It was and still is popular in financial, pre-modeling applications, and insurance applications, in simulations, and in mathematical applications. APL has been used in a wide variety of contexts and for many and varied purposes, including artificial intelligence and robotics. A newsletter titled "Quote-Quad" dedicated to APL was published from the 1970s until 2007 by the SIGAPL section of the Association for Computing Machinery (Quote-Quad is the name of the APL character used for text input and output).

Before the advent of full-screen systems and until as late as the mid-1980s, systems were written such that the user entered instructions in his own business specific vocabulary. APL <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a> vendors delivered applications in this form. On the <a href="I.%20P.%20Sharp%20Associates">I. P. Sharp</a> timesharing system, a workspace called 39 MAGIC offered access to financial and airline data plus sophisticated (for the time) graphing and reporting. Another example is the GRAPHPAK workspace supplied with IBM's APL, then APL2.

Because of its matrix operations, APL was for some time quite popular for computer graphics programming, where graphic transformations could be encoded as matrix multiplications. One of the first commercial computer graphics houses, <a href="Digital%20Effects%20%28studio%29">Digital Effects</a>, based in New York City, produced an APL graphics product known as "Visions", which was used to create television commercials and, reportedly, animation for the 1982 film "<a href="Tron">Tron</a>". Digital Effects' use of APL was informally described at a number of SIGAPL conferences in the late 1980s; examples discussed included the early UK <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> TV logo/ident.

Interest in APL has declined from a peak in the mid-1980s. This appears partly due to lack of smooth migration pathways from higher performing memory-intensive mainframe implementations to low-cost personal computer alternatives - APL implementations for computers before the <a href="Intel%2080386">Intel 80386</a> released in the late 1980s were only suitable for small applications. Another important reason for the decline is the lack of low cost, standardized and robust, compiled APL executables - usable across multiple computer hardware and OS platforms. There are several APL version permutations across various APL implementations, particularly differences between IBM's APL2 and APL2000's APL+ versions. Another practical limitation is that APL has fallen behind modern integrated computing environments with respect to debugging capabilities or test-driven development. Consequently, while APL remains eminently suitable for small-to-medium-sized programs, productivity gains for larger projects involving teams of developers would be questionable.

The growth of end-user computing tools such as <a href="Microsoft%20Excel">Microsoft Excel</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Access">Microsoft Access</a> has indirectly eroded potential APL usage. These are frequently appropriate platforms for what may have been APL applications in the 1970s and 1980s. Some APL users migrated to the <a href="J%20programming%20language">J programming language</a>, which offers some advanced features. Lastly, the decline was also due in part to the growth of <a href="MATLAB">MATLAB</a>, <a href="GNU%20Octave">GNU Octave</a>, and <a href="Scilab">Scilab</a>. These scientific computing array-oriented platforms provide an interactive computing experience similar to APL, but more closely resemble conventional programming languages such as Fortran, and use standard ASCII. Other APL users continue to wait for a very low-cost, standardized, broad-hardware-usable APL implementation.

Notwithstanding this decline, APL finds continued use in certain fields, such as accounting research, pre-hardcoded modeling, DNA identification technology, symbolic mathematical expression and learning. It remains an inspiration to its current user base as well as for other languages.

APL has been standardized by the <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">ANSI</a> <a href="working%20group">working group</a> X3J10 and <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a>/<a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">IEC</a> Joint Technical Committee 1 Subcommittee 22 Working Group 3. The Core APL language is specified in ISO 8485:1989, and the Extended APL language is specified in ISO/IEC 13751:2001.

ALGOL

ALGOL (short for Algorithmic Language) is a family of <a href="imperative%20programming">imperative</a> computer <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>s, originally developed in the mid-1950s, which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> description used by the <a href="Association%20for%20Computing%20Machinery">ACM</a> in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years.

In the sense that the syntax of most modern languages is "Algol-like", it was arguably the most influential of the four high-level programming languages with which it was roughly contemporary: <a href="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a>, <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>, and <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a>. It was designed to avoid some of the perceived problems with FORTRAN and eventually gave rise to many other programming languages, including <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a>, <a href="Simula">Simula</a>, <a href="BCPL">BCPL</a>, <a href="B%20%28programming%20language%29">B</a>, <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>, and <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>.

ALGOL introduced code blocks and the codice_1…codice_2 pairs for delimiting them. It was also the first language implementing <a href="nested%20function">nested function</a> definitions with <a href="lexical%20scope">lexical scope</a>. Moreover, it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the "<a href="Algol%2060%23History">Algol 60 Report</a>" introduced <a href="Backus%E2%80%93Naur%20form">Backus–Naur form</a>, a principal <a href="formal%20grammar">formal grammar</a> notation for language design.

There were three major specifications, named after the year they were first published:

<a href="Niklaus%20Wirth">Niklaus Wirth</a> based his own <a href="ALGOL%20W">ALGOL W</a> on ALGOL 60 before developing <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>. ALGOL-W was based on the proposal for the next generation ALGOL, but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced, rather than a cleaned, simplified ALGOL 60.

ALGOL 68 is substantially different from ALGOL 60 and was not well received, so that in general "Algol" means ALGOL 60 and dialects thereof.

The <a href="ALGOL%2058">International Algebraic Language</a> (IAL) was extremely influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages (the so-called Algol-like languages). Additionally, ALGOL object code was a simple, compact, and stack-based <a href="instruction%20set">instruction set architecture</a> commonly used in teaching <a href="compiler">compiler</a> construction and other high order languages (of which Algol is generally considered the first).

ALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at <a href="ETH%20Zurich">ETH Zurich</a> (cf. <a href="ALGOL%2058">ALGOL 58</a>). It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs periods) for different languages.

ALGOL was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard input/output facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than <a href="Burroughs%20Corporation">Burroughs Corporation</a>. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.

<a href="John%20Backus">John Backus</a> developed the <a href="Backus%E2%80%93Naur%20form">Backus normal form</a> method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by <a href="Peter%20Naur">Peter Naur</a> for ALGOL 60, and at <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>'s suggestion renamed <a href="Backus%E2%80%93Naur%20form">Backus–Naur form</a>.

Peter Naur: "As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960."

The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from 1 to 16 January):
Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: "The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent."

ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. <a href="C.%20A.%20R.%20Hoare">C. A. R. Hoare</a> remarked: "Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors." The <a href="Scheme%20%28programming%20language%29">Scheme</a> programming language, a variant of <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme" for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.

As <a href="Peter%20Landin">Peter Landin</a> noted, the language Algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the (call-by-name) <a href="lambda%20calculus">lambda calculus</a>. Perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to <a href="John%20C.%20Reynolds">John C. Reynolds</a>, and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity. Reynolds's idealized Algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call-by-name languages, to be contrasted with the global effects used by call-by-value languages such as <a href="ML%20%28programming%20language%29">ML</a>. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with <a href="Programming%20language%20for%20Computable%20Functions">PCF</a> and ML.

To date there have been at least 70 augmentations, extensions, derivations and sublanguages of Algol 60.

The Burroughs dialects included special Bootstrapping dialects such as <a href="Executive%20Systems%20Problem%20Oriented%20Language">ESPOL</a> and <a href="NEWP">NEWP</a>. The latter is still used for Unisys MCP system software.

ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no <a href="I/O">I/O</a> facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of "transput" (input/output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two <a href="evaluation%20strategy">evaluation strategies</a> for <a href="Parameter%20%28computer%20science%29">parameter</a> passing: the common <a href="call-by-value">call-by-value</a>, and <a href="call-by-name">call-by-name</a>. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to <a href="call-by-reference">call-by-reference</a>. For example, without specifying the parameters as "value" or "reference", it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable. Think of passing a pointer to swap(i, A[i]) in to a function. Now that every time swap is referenced, it is reevaluated. Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap is referenced it'll return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.

Call-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting "<a href="Thunk%20%28delayed%20computation%29">thunk</a>s" that are used to implement it. <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> devised the "<a href="man%20or%20boy%20test">man or boy test</a>" to separate compilers that correctly implemented "<a href="recursion%20%28computer%20science%29">recursion</a> and non-local references." This test contains an example of call-by-name.

ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Wijngaarden">Adriaan van Wijngaarden</a> and which bears his name. <a href="Van%20Wijngaarden%20grammar">Van Wijngaarden grammar</a>s use a <a href="context-free%20grammar">context-free grammar</a> to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled "semantics" and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as "ad hoc" code attached to the formal language parser.

 procedure Absmax(a) Size:(n, m) Result:(y) Subscripts:(i, k);

Here's an example of how to produce a <a href="Table%20%28information%29">table</a> using Elliott 803 ALGOL.

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.<br>
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.<br>
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point.

The following code samples are ALGOL 68 versions of the above ALGOL 60 code samples.

ALGOL 68 implementations used ALGOL 60's approaches to <a href="stropping%20%28programming%29">stropping</a>. In ALGOL 68's case tokens with the bold typeface are reserved words, types (modes) or operators.

Note: lower (⌊) and upper (⌈) bounds of an array, and array slicing, are directly available to the programmer.

The variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic <a href="hello%20world%20program">hello world program</a>.

ALGOL 58 had no I/O facilities.

Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable <a href="hello%20world%20program">hello world program</a> in ALGOL.

A simpler program using an inline format:

An even simpler program using the Display statement:

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows. Elliott Algol used different characters for "open-string-quote" and "close-string-quote":

Here's a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case. The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote. Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).

The <a href="ICT%201900%20series">ICT 1900 series</a> Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card. Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case. Output was to a line printer. The open and close quote characters were represented using '(' and ')' and spaces by %.

ALGOL 68 code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase, but bolded or underlined.
In the language of the "Algol 68 Report" the input/output facilities were collectively called the "<a href="Input/output">Transput</a>".

The ALGOLs were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly; also, the ALGOLs were defined so that only "uppercase" letters were required.

1960: <a href="IFIP">IFIP</a> – The Algol 60 language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems, but, unfortunately, were not supported on most computing systems at the time. For instance: ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬, ∨, ∧, ⊂, ≡, ␣ and ⏨.

1961 September: ASCII – The <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> character set, then in an early stage of development, had the <a href="%5C">\</a> (Back slash) character added to it in order to support ALGOL's <a href="boolean%20data%20type">boolean</a> operators <a href="%5C/">/\</a> and <a href="%5C/">\/</a>.

1962: <a href="ALCOR">ALCOR</a> – This character set included the unusual "᛭" (iron/runic cross) character and the "⏨" (Decimal Exponent Symbol) for floating point notation.

1964: <a href="GOST">GOST</a> – The 1964 Soviet standard <a href="GOST%2010859">GOST 10859</a> allowed the encoding of 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit and 7-bit characters in ALGOL.

1968: The "Algol 68 Report" – used existing ALGOL characters, and further adopted →, ↓, ↑, □, ⌊, ⌈, ⎩, ⎧, ○, ⊥ and ¢ characters which can be found on the <a href="IBM%202741">IBM 2741</a> keyboard with "golf-ball" print heads inserted (such as the <a href="APL%20syntax%20and%20symbols">APL</a> golfball). These became available in the mid-1960s while ALGOL 68 was being drafted. The report was translated into Russian, German, French and Bulgarian, and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets, e.g. <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> alphabet of the Soviet <a href="BESM">BESM-4</a>. All ALGOL's characters are also part of the <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> standard and most of them are available in several popular <a href="font">font</a>s.

2009 October: <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> – The "⏨" (Decimal Exponent Symbol) for floating point notation was added to Unicode 5.2 for backward compatibility with historic <a href="Buran%20%28spacecraft%29">Buran (spacecraft)</a> ALGOL software.

The AWK language is a <a href="data-driven%20programming">data-driven</a> <a href="scripting%20language">scripting language</a> consisting of a set of actions to be taken against <a href="Stream%20%28computing%29">streams</a> of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a <a href="pipeline%20%28Unix%29">pipeline</a> – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the <a href="string%20%28computer%20science%29">string</a> <a href="datatype">datatype</a>, <a href="associative%20array">associative array</a>s (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and <a href="regular%20expression">regular expression</a>s. While AWK has a limited intended <a href="application%20domain">application domain</a> and was especially designed to support <a href="one-liner%20program">one-liner program</a>s, the language is <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a>, and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs.

AWK was created at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> in the 1970s, and its name is derived from the <a href="surname">surname</a>s of its authors—<a href="Alfred%20Aho">Alfred Aho</a>, <a href="Peter%20J.%20Weinberger">Peter Weinberger</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>. The acronym is pronounced the same as the name of the bird <a href="auk">auk</a> (which acts as an emblem of the language such as on "The AWK Programming Language" book cover – the book is often referred to by the abbreviation "TAPL"). When written in all lowercase letters, as codice_1, it refers to the <a href="Unix">Unix</a> or <a href="Plan%209%20from%20Bell%20Labs">Plan 9</a> program that runs scripts written in the AWK programming language.

AWK was initially developed in 1977 by <a href="Alfred%20Aho">Alfred Aho</a>, <a href="Peter%20Weinberger">Peter Weinberger</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>, from whose initials the language takes its name. As one of the early tools to appear in <a href="Version%207%20Unix">Version 7 Unix</a>, AWK added computational features to a Unix <a href="pipeline%20%28Unix%29">pipeline</a> besides the <a href="Bourne%20shell">Bourne shell</a>, the only scripting language available in a standard Unix environment. It is one of the mandatory utilities of the <a href="Single%20UNIX%20Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a>, and is required by the <a href="Linux%20Standard%20Base">Linux Standard Base</a> specification.

AWK was significantly revised and expanded in 1985–88, resulting in the <a href="Gawk%20%28GNU%20package%29">GNU AWK</a> implementation written by <a href="Paul%20Rubin">Paul Rubin</a>, <a href="Jay%20Fenlason">Jay Fenlason</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>, released in 1988. GNU AWK is the most widely deployed version because it is included with GNU-based Linux packages. GNU AWK has been maintained solely by <a href="Arnold%20Robbins">Arnold Robbins</a> since 1994. <a href="Brian%20Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>'s <a href="nawk">nawk</a> (New AWK) source was first released in 1993 unpublicized, and publicly since the late 1990s; many BSD systems use it to avoid GPL license.

AWK was preceded by <a href="sed">sed</a> (1974). Both were designed for text processing. They share the line-oriented, data-driven paradigm, and are particularly suited to writing <a href="one-liner%20program">one-liner program</a>s, due to the implicit <a href="main%20loop">main loop</a> and current line variables. The power and terseness of early AWK programs – notably the powerful regular expression handling and conciseness due to implicit variables, which facilitate one-liners – together with the limitations of AWK at the time, were important inspirations for the <a href="Perl">Perl</a> language (1987). In the 1990s, Perl became very popular, competing with AWK in the niche of Unix text-processing languages.

"AWK is a language for processing text files. A file is treated as a sequence of records, and by default each line is a record. Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. An AWK program is a sequence of pattern-action statements. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed." - Alfred V. Aho
An AWK program is a series of pattern action pairs, written as:

where "condition" is typically an expression and "action" is a series of commands. The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn, and executes the "action" for each expression that is true. Either the "condition" or the "action" may be omitted. The "condition" defaults to matching every record. The default "action" is to print the record. This is the same pattern-action structure as sed.

In addition to a simple AWK expression, such as codice_2 or codice_3, the "condition" can be codice_4 or codice_5 causing the "action" to be executed before or after all records have been read, or "pattern1, pattern2" which matches the range of records starting with a record that matches "pattern1" up to and including the record that matches "pattern2" before again trying to match against "pattern1" on future lines.

In addition to normal arithmetic and logical operators, AWK expressions include the tilde operator, codice_6, which matches a <a href="regular%20expression">regular expression</a> against a string. As handy <a href="syntactic%20sugar">syntactic sugar</a>, "/regexp/" without using the tilde operator matches against the current record; this syntax derives from <a href="sed">sed</a>, which in turn inherited it from the <a href="Ed%20%28text%20editor%29">ed</a> editor, where codice_7 is used for searching. This syntax of using slashes as <a href="delimiter">delimiter</a>s for regular expressions was subsequently adopted by Perl and ECMAScript, and is now quite common. The tilde operator was also adopted by Perl, but has not seen as wide use.

AWK commands are the statements that are substituted for "action" in the examples above. AWK commands can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof. AWK contains built-in support for many functions; many more are provided by the various flavors of AWK. Also, some flavors support the inclusion of <a href="dynamically%20linked%20library">dynamically linked libraries</a>, which can also provide more functions.

The "print" command is used to output text. The output text is always terminated with a predefined string called the output record separator (ORS) whose default value is a newline. The simplest form of this command is:


Although these fields ("$X") may bear resemblance to variables (the $ symbol indicates variables in <a href="Perl">Perl</a>), they actually refer to the fields of the current record. A special case, "$0", refers to the entire record. In fact, the commands "codice_8" and "codice_12" are identical in functionality.

The "print" command can also display the results of calculations and/or function calls:
Output may be sent to a file:
or through a <a href="pipe%20%28Unix%29">pipe</a>:

Awk's built-in variables include the field variables: $1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 represents the entire record). They hold the text or values in the individual text-fields in a record.

Other variables include:

Variable names can use any of the characters [A-Za-z0-9_], with the exception of language keywords. The operators "+ - * /" represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. For string <a href="concatenation">concatenation</a>, simply place two variables (or string constants) next to each other. It is optional to use a space in between if string constants are involved, but two variable names placed adjacent to each other require a space in between. Double quotes <a href="delimit">delimit</a> string constants. Statements need not end with semicolons. Finally, comments can be added to programs by using "#" as the first character on a line.

In a format similar to <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, function definitions consist of the keyword codice_21, the function name, argument names and the function body. Here is an example of a function.
This statement can be invoked as follows:
Functions can have variables that are in the local scope. The names of these are added to the end of the argument list, though values for these should be omitted when calling the function. It is convention to add some <a href="whitespace%20character">whitespace</a> in the argument list before the local variables, to indicate where the parameters end and the local variables begin.

Here is the customary "<a href="%26quot%3BHello%2C%20World%21%26quot%3B%20program">Hello, world</a>" program written in AWK:
Note that an explicit codice_22 statement is not needed here; since the only pattern is codice_4, no command-line arguments are processed.

Print all lines longer than 80 characters. Note that the default action is to print the current line.

Count words in the input and print the number of lines, words, and characters (like <a href="wc%20%28Unix%29">wc</a>):
As there is no pattern for the first line of the program, every line of input matches by default, so the increment actions are executed for every line. Note that codice_24 is shorthand for codice_25.

"s" is incremented by the numeric value of "$NF", which is the last word on the line as defined by AWK's field separator (by default, white-space). "NF" is the number of fields in the current line, e.g. 4. Since "$4" is the value of the fourth field, "$NF" is the value of the last field in the line regardless of how many fields this line has, or whether it has more or fewer fields than surrounding lines. $ is actually a unary operator with the highest <a href="operator%20precedence">operator precedence</a>. (If the line has no fields, then "NF" is 0, "$0" is the whole line, which in this case is empty apart from possible white-space, and so has the numeric value 0.)

At the end of the input the "END" pattern matches, so "s" is printed. However, since there may have been no lines of input at all, in which case no value has ever been assigned to "s", it will by default be an empty string. Adding zero to a variable is an AWK idiom for coercing it from a string to a numeric value. (Concatenating an empty string is to coerce from a number to a string, e.g. "s """. Note, there's no operator to concatenate strings, they're just placed adjacently.) With the coercion the program prints "0" on an empty input, without it an empty line is printed.

The action statement prints each line numbered. The printf function emulates the standard C <a href="printf">printf</a> and works similarly to the print command described above. The pattern to match, however, works as follows: "NR" is the number of records, typically lines of input, AWK has so far read, i.e. the current line number, starting at 1 for the first line of input. "%" is the <a href="modulo%20operation">modulo</a> operator. "NR % 4 == 1" is true for the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., lines of input. Likewise, "NR % 4 == 3" is true for the 3rd, 7th, 11th, etc., lines of input. The range pattern is false until the first part matches, on line 1, and then remains true up to and including when the second part matches, on line 3. It then stays false until the first part matches again on line 5.

Thus, the program prints lines 1,2,3, skips line 4, and then 5,6,7, and so on. For each line, it prints the line number (on a 6 character-wide field) and then the line contents. For example, when executed on this input:

The previous program prints:

As a special case, when the first part of a range pattern is constantly true, e.g. "1", the range will start at the beginning of the input. Similarly, if the second part is constantly false, e.g. "0", the range will continue until the end of input. For example,

prints lines of input from the first line matching the regular expression "^--cut here--$", that is, a line containing only the phrase "--cut here--", to the end.

<a href="Word%20frequency">Word frequency</a> using <a href="associative%20array">associative array</a>s:
The BEGIN block sets the field separator to any sequence of non-alphabetic characters. Note that separators can be regular expressions. After that, we get to a bare action, which performs the action on every input line. In this case, for every field on the line, we add one to the number of times that word, first converted to lowercase, appears. Finally, in the END block, we print the words with their frequencies. The line
creates a loop that goes through the array "words", setting "i" to each "subscript" of the array. This is different from most languages, where such a loop goes through each "value" in the array. The loop thus prints out each word followed by its frequency count. codice_26 was an addition to the One True awk (see below) made after the book was published.

This program can be represented in several ways. The first one uses the <a href="Bourne%20shell">Bourne shell</a> to make a shell script that does everything. It is the shortest of these methods:
The codice_27 in the awk command is not protected by single quotes so that the shell does expand the variable but it needs to be put in double quotes to properly handle patterns containing spaces. A pattern by itself in the usual way checks to see if the whole line (codice_28) matches. codice_15 contains the current filename. awk has no explicit concatenation operator; two adjacent strings concatenate them. codice_28 expands to the original unchanged input line.

There are alternate ways of writing this. This shell script accesses the environment directly from within awk:
This is a shell script that uses codice_31, an array introduced in a newer version of the One True awk after the book was published. The subscript of codice_31 is the name of an environment variable; its result is the variable's value. This is like the <a href="getenv">getenv</a> function in various standard libraries and <a href="POSIX">POSIX</a>. The shell script makes an environment variable codice_33 containing the first argument, then drops that argument and has awk look for the pattern in each file.

codice_6 checks to see if its left operand matches its right operand; codice_35 is its inverse. Note that a regular expression is just a string and can be stored in variables.

The next way uses command-line variable assignment, in which an argument to awk can be seen as an assignment to a variable:
Or You can use the "-v var=value" command line option (e.g. "awk -v pattern="$pattern" ...").

Finally, this is written in pure awk, without help from a shell or without the need to know too much about the implementation of the awk script (as the variable assignment on command line one does), but is a bit lengthy:
The codice_4 is necessary not only to extract the first argument, but also to prevent it from being interpreted as a filename after the codice_4 block ends. codice_38, the number of arguments, is always guaranteed to be ≥1, as codice_39 is the name of the command that executed the script, most often the string codice_40. Also note that codice_41 is the empty string, codice_42. codice_43 initiates a comment that expands to the end of the line.

Note the codice_44 block. awk only checks to see if it should read from standard input before it runs the command. This means that
only works because the fact that there are no filenames is only checked before codice_45 is run! If you explicitly set codice_38 to 1 so that there are no arguments, awk will simply quit because it feels there are no more input files. Therefore, you need to explicitly say to read from standard input with the special filename codice_47.

On Unix-like operating systems self-contained AWK scripts can be constructed using the <a href="shebang%20%28Unix%29">shebang</a> syntax.

For example, a script that prints the content of a given file may be built by creating a file named codice_48 with the following content:
It can be invoked with: codice_49

The codice_50 tells AWK that the argument that follows is the file to read the AWK program from, which is the same flag that is used in sed. Since they are often used for one-liners, both these programs default to executing a program given as a command-line argument, rather than a separate file.

AWK was originally written in 1977 and distributed with <a href="Version%207%20Unix">Version 7 Unix</a>.

In 1985 its authors started expanding the language, most significantly by adding user-defined functions. The language is described in the book "The AWK Programming Language", published 1988, and its implementation was made available in releases of <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">UNIX System V</a>. To avoid confusion with the incompatible older version, this version was sometimes called "new awk" or "nawk". This implementation was released under a <a href="free%20software%20license">free software license</a> in 1996 and is still maintained by Brian Kernighan (see external links below).
Old versions of Unix, such as <a href="UNIX/32V">UNIX/32V</a>, included codice_51, which converted AWK to C. Kernighan wrote a program to turn awk into C++; its state is not known.

Asgard

In <a href="Norse%20religion">Norse religion</a>, Asgard (; "Enclosure of the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a>") is one of the <a href="Norse%20cosmology">Nine Worlds</a> and home to the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a> tribe of <a href="Norse%20gods">gods</a>. It is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a <a href="Hrimthurs">Hrimthurs</a> riding the <a href="stallion">stallion</a> <a href="Sva%C3%B0ilfari">Svaðilfari</a>, according to "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>". <a href="Odin">Odin</a> and his wife, <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a>, are the rulers of Asgard.

One of Asgard's well known realms is <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, in which Odin rules.

The primary sources regarding Asgard come from the <a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>, written in the 13th century by <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>ic historian <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>, and the <a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>, compiled in the 13th century from a basis of much older <a href="Skald">Skaldic poetry</a>.

"<a href="V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1">Völuspá</a>", the first poem of the work, mentions many of the features and characters of Asgard portrayed by Snorri, such as <a href="Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a> and <a href="I%C3%B0av%C3%B6llr">Iðavöllr</a>. Asgard is composed of 12 realms including Valhalla, <a href="%C3%9Er%C3%BA%C3%B0heimr">Thrudheim</a>, <a href="Breidablik">Breidablik</a> who are rule over Odin, Thor and Balder respectively.

The <a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a> presents two views regarding Asgard.

In the "Prologue" Snorri offers an <a href="Euhemerism">euhemerized</a> and Christian-influenced interpretation of the myths and tales of his forefathers. Asgard, he conjectures, is the home of the Æsir (singular Ás) in As-ia, making a <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymological</a> connection between the three "As-"; that is, the Æsir were "men of Asia", not gods, who moved from Asia to the north and some of which intermarried with the peoples already there. Snorri's interpretation of the 13th century foreshadows 20th-century views of <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> migration from the east.

Snorri further writes that Asgard is a land more fertile than any other, blessed also with a great abundance of gold and jewels. Correspondingly, the Æsir excelled beyond all other people in strength, beauty and talent.

Snorri proposes the location of Asgard as <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, the center of the earth. About it were 12 kingdoms and 12 chiefs. One of them, Múnón, married <a href="Priam">Priam</a>'s daughter, Tróán, and had by her a son, Trór, to be pronounced <a href="Thor">Thor</a> in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>. The latter was raised in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. At age 12 he was whiter than ivory, had hair lighter than gold, and could lift 10 bear skins at once. He explored far and wide. His father, Odin, led a migration to the northern lands, where they took wives and had many children, populating the entire north with Aesir. One of the sons of Odin was <a href="Yngvi">Yngvi</a>, founder of the <a href="Ynglingar">Ynglingar</a>, an early royal family of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. These accounts were written 200 years after the 

Christianization of Iceland.

In "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>", Snorri presents the mythological version, taken no doubt from his sources. Icelanders were still being converted at that time. He could not present the myths as part of any current belief. Instead he resorts to a debunking device: Gylfi, king of Sweden before the Æsir, travels to Asgard and finds there a large hall (<a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>) in Section 2.

Within are three officials (three Aesir Kings), whom Gylfi in the guise of Gangleri is allowed to question about the Asgard and the Æsir. A revelation of the ancient myths follows, but at the end the palace and the people disappear in a clap of thunder and Gylfi finds himself alone on the plain, having been deluded (Section 59).

In Gylfi's delusion, ancient Asgard was ruled by the senior god, the all-father, who had twelve names. He was the ruler of everything and the creator of heaven and earth (Section 3). During a complex creation myth in which the cosmic cow <a href="Au%C3%B0umbla">Audhumbla</a> licked <a href="B%C3%BAri">Búri</a> free from the ice, the sons of Buri's son, <a href="Borr">Bor</a>, who were <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, <a href="Vili%20and%20V%C3%A9">Vili and Vé</a>, constructed the universe and put <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a> in it as a residence for the first human couple, <a href="Ask%20and%20Embla">Ask and Embla</a>, whom they created from driftwood trees in Section 9.

The sons of Bor then constructed Asgard (to be identified with Troy, Snorri insists in section 9) as a home for the Æsir, who were divinities. Odin is identified as the all-father. Asgard is conceived as being on the earth. A rainbow bridge, <a href="Bifr%C3%B6st">Bifröst</a>, connects it to heaven (Section 13). In Asgard also is a temple for the 12 gods, <a href="Gladsheim">Gladsheim</a>, and another for the 12 goddesses, <a href="Ving%C3%B3lf">Vingólf</a>. The plain of <a href="Idavoll">Idavoll</a> is the centre of Asgard (Section 14).

The gods hold court there every day at the <a href="Wyrd">Well of Urd</a>, beneath an ash tree, <a href="Yggdrasil">Yggdrasil</a>, debating the fates of men and gods. The more immediate destinies of men are assigned by the <a href="Norns">Norns</a> (Section 15). It also states Thor is a god as well.

Long descriptions of the gods follow. Among the more memorable details are the <a href="Valkyries">Valkyries</a>, the battle maidens whom Odin sends to allot death or victory to soldiers. Section 37 names 13 Valkyries and states that the source as the Poetic Edda poem "<a href="Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l">Grímnismál</a>". Odin's residence is <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, to which he takes those slain in battle, the <a href="Einherjar">Einherjar</a> (Section 20). Snorri quips: "There is a huge crowd there, and there will be many more still ..." (Section 39). They amuse themselves every day by fighting each other and then going to drink in the big hall.

Toward the end of the chapter Snorri becomes prophetic, describing <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>, the twilight of the gods. Much of it sounds like the <a href="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, by which Snorri, a Christian, can hardly fail to have been influenced. It will begin with three winters of snow, with no summers in between. Wars will follow, then earthquakes and tidal waves. The sky will split open and out will ride the sons of <a href="Muspell">Muspell</a> intent on universal destruction. They will try to enter heaven but Bifröst will break (Section 55). <a href="Heimdall">Heimdall</a> will blow his mighty horn Gjöll and the Æsir and Einherjar will ride out to battle. Most of the Æsir will die and Asgard be destroyed. Snorri quotes his own source saying: "The sun will go black, earth sink in the sea, heaven be stripped of its bright stars;..." (Section 56).

Afterwards, the earth rises again from the sea, is fairer than before, and where Asgard used to be a remnant of the Æsir gather, some coming up from <a href="Hel%20%28location%29">Hel</a>, and talk and play chess all day with the golden chessmen of the ancient Æsir, which they find in the grass (Section 58).

The 10th century Skald <a href="%C3%9Eorbj%C3%B6rn%20d%C3%ADsarsk%C3%A1ld">Þorbjörn dísarskáld</a> is quoted in "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>" as stating:

Thor has defended Asgard and <a href="List%20of%20names%20of%20Odin">Ygg's</a> [Odin's] people [the gods] with strength.

By the time of the "<a href="Ynglinga%20Saga">Ynglinga Saga</a>", Snorri had developed his concept of Asgard further, although the differences might be accounted for by his sources. In the initial stanzas of the poem Asagarth is the capital of Asaland, a section of Asia to the east of the Tana-kvísl or Vana-Kvísl river (kvísl is "fork"), which Snorri explains is the <a href="Tanais">Tanais</a>, or <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don River</a>, flowing into the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. The river divides "Sweden the Great", a concession to the <a href="Viking">Viking</a> point of view. It is never called that prior to the Vikings (Section 1).

The river lands are occupied by the <a href="Vanir">Vanir</a> and are called Vanaland or Vanaheim. It is unclear what people Snorri thinks the Vanes are, whether the proto-<a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> <a href="Venedi">Venedi</a> or the east Germanic <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, who had been in that region at that time for well over 1000 years. He does not say; however, the Germanic names of the characters, such as Njord, Frey and Vanlandi, indicate he had the Vandals in mind.

Odin is the chief of Asagarth. From there he conducts and dispatches military expeditions to all parts of the world. He has the virtue of never losing a battle (Section 2). When he is away, his two brothers, <a href="Vili%20and%20V%C3%A9">Vili and Vé</a>, rule Asaland from Asagarth.

On the border of Sweden is a mountain range running from northeast to southwest. South of it are the lands of the Turks, where Odin had possessions; thus, the mountains must be the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a>. On the north are the uninhabitable fells, which must be the tundra/taiga country. Apparently the Vikings did not encounter the <a href="Urals">Urals</a> or the <a href="Uralic%20peoples">Uralics</a> of the region. Snorri evidences no knowledge of them.

There also is no mention of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, which was not far from <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, capital of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and militarily beyond the reach of the Vikings. Troy cannot have been Asagarth, Snorri realizes, the reason being that the Æsir in Asaland were unsettled by the military activities of the Romans; that is, of the Byzantine Empire.

As a result, Odin led a section of the Æsir to the north looking for new lands in which to settle. They used the Viking route up the Don and the <a href="Volga">Volga</a> through <a href="Gar%C3%B0ar%C3%ADki">Garðaríki</a>, Viking <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. From there they went to Saxland (Germany) and to the lands of <a href="Gylfi">Gylfi</a> in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> (Section 5). The historical view, of course, is mainly fantastical. The Germanics were in Germany and Scandinavia during earliest mention of them in Roman literature, long before the Romans had even conquered Italy. To what extent Snorri's presentation is poetic creation only remains unclear.

Demoted from his position as all-father, or king of the gods, Odin becomes a great sorcerer in the Ynglinga Saga. He can shape-shift, speaks only in verse, and lies so well that everything he says seems true. He strikes enemies blind and deaf but when his own men fight they go <a href="Berserker">berserk</a> and cannot be harmed. He has a ship that can be rolled up like a tablecloth when not used, he relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence, and he consults the talking head of a dwarf for prophecy (he carries it around long since detached from its body) (Section 7).

As a man, however, Odin is faced with the necessity to die. He is cremated and his possessions are burned with him so that he can ascend to - where? If Asgard is an earthly place, not there. Snorri says at first it is Valhalla and then adds: "The Swedes now believed that he had gone to the old Asagarth and would live there forever" (Section 9). Finally Snorri resorts to Heaven, even though nothing in Christianity advocates cremation and certainly the burning of possessions avails the Christian nothing.

"Asgard" is derived from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "āss", god + "garðr", enclosure; from <a href="Indo%20European%20language">Indo-European</a> roots "ansu-" spirit, demon (see cognate <a href="Ahura%20Mazda">ahura</a>; also <a href="asura">asura</a>) + "gher-" grasp, enclose (see cognates <a href="garden">garden</a> and <a href="Yard%20%28land%29">yard</a>), essentially meaning "garden of gods".

Apollo program

The Apollo program, also known as Project Apollo, was the third United States <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> program carried out by the <a href="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> from 1969 to 1972. First conceived during <a href="Presidency%20of%20Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration</a> as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a> which put the first Americans in space, Apollo was later dedicated to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s national goal of "landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth" by the end of the 1960s, which he proposed in an address to <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> on May 25, 1961.

Kennedy's goal was accomplished on the <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> mission when astronauts <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> landed their <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> remained in <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a> in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20astronauts%23Apollo%20astronauts%20who%20walked%20on%20the%20Moon">twelve men walked on the Moon</a>.

Apollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first manned flight in 1968. It achieved its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Moon">geological</a> and <a href="astrophysics">astrophysical</a> exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which damaged the CSM's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a "lifeboat" for these functions. Apollo used <a href="Saturn%20%28rocket%20family%29">Saturn family rockets</a> as launch vehicles, which were also used for an <a href="Apollo%20Applications%20Program">Apollo Applications Program</a>, which consisted of <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a>, a <a href="space%20station">space station</a> that supported three manned missions in 1973–74, and the <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz Test Project</a>, a joint Earth orbit mission with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1975.

Apollo set several major <a href="List%20of%20space%20exploration%20milestones%2C%201957%E2%80%931969">human spaceflight milestones</a>. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>. <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a> mission marked the sixth <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a> and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit. The program returned of lunar rocks and <a href="lunar%20soil">soil</a> to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its <a href="Johnson%20Space%20Center">Johnson Space Center</a> and <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and <a href="Human%20spaceflight">manned spaceflight</a>, including <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, telecommunications, and computers.

The Apollo program was conceived during the <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>. While the Mercury <a href="space%20capsule">capsule</a> could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three astronauts. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a <a href="space%20station">space station</a>, <a href="circumlunar%20trajectory">circumlunar flight</a>s, and eventual manned <a href="Moon%20landing">lunar landing</a>s. The program was named after the <a href="Apollo">Greek god of light, music, and the sun</a> by NASA manager <a href="Abe%20Silverstein">Abe Silverstein</a>, who later said that "I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby." Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt "Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program."

In July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator <a href="Hugh%20L.%20Dryden">Hugh L. Dryden</a> announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of <a href="Space%20Task%20Group">Space Task Group</a> conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a "mission module" cabin separate from the "command module" (piloting and re-entry cabin), and a "propulsion and equipment module". On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to <a href="Convair">General Dynamics/Convair</a>, <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>, and the <a href="Glenn%20L.%20Martin%20Company">Glenn L. Martin Company</a>. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by <a href="Maxime%20Faget">Maxime Faget</a>, to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.

In November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the fields of <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a> and <a href="missile%20defense">missile defense</a>. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the "<a href="missile%20gap">missile gap</a>" that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not "first but, first and, first if, but first period." Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator <a href="James%20E.%20Webb">James E. Webb</a> requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.

On April 12, 1961, Soviet <a href="astronaut%23Russian">cosmonaut</a> <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Science%2C%20Space%20and%20Technology">Committee on Science and Astronautics</a> one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up. Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.
On April 20, Kennedy sent a memo to <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, asking Johnson to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up. Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that "we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership." His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first.

On May 25, 1961, twenty days after the first US manned spaceflight <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">"Freedom 7"</a>, Kennedy proposed the manned Moon landing in a "Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs":
"Now it is time to take longer strides - time for a great new American enterprise - time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth.<br><br>...I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important in the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish." 

At the time of Kennedy's proposal, only one American had flown in space—less than a month earlier—and NASA had not yet sent an astronaut into orbit. Even some NASA employees doubted whether Kennedy's ambitious goal could be met. By 1963, Kennedy even came close to agreeing to a joint US-USSR Moon mission, to eliminate duplication of effort.

With the clear goal of a manned landing replacing the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to hit the ground running, and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module was determined to be only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> had won the contract, although its bid was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and <a href="Robert%20Seamans">Robert Seamans</a> chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.

Landing men on the Moon by the end of 1969 required the most sudden burst of technological creativity, and the largest commitment of resources ($24 billion) ever made by any nation in peacetime. At its peak, the Apollo program employed 400,000 people and required the support of over 20,000 industrial firms and universities.

On July 1, 1960, NASA established the <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC) in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>. MSFC designed the heavy lift-class <a href="Saturn%20%28rocket%20family%29">Saturn launch vehicles</a>, which would be required for Apollo.

It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of <a href="Robert%20R.%20Gilruth">Robert R. Gilruth</a>'s <a href="Space%20Task%20Group">Space Task Group</a>, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a>. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> (MSC). A site was chosen in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas, on land donated by <a href="Rice%20University">Rice University</a>, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station">Cape Canaveral Air Force Station</a> launch facilities in Florida, so a new <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control Center</a> would be included in the MSC.
In September 1962, by which time two Project Mercury astronauts had orbited the Earth, Gilruth had moved his organization to rented space in Houston, and construction of the MSC facility was under way, Kennedy visited Rice to reiterate his challenge in <a href="We%20choose%20to%20go%20to%20the%20Moon">a famous speech</a>:
"But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? ... <br>
We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills; because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win ... . 

The MSC was completed in September 1963. It was renamed by the US Congress in honor of Lyndon Johnson soon after his death in 1973.

It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch facilities in Florida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the <a href="Saturn%20I">Saturn I</a> and <a href="Saturn%20IB">IB</a> rockets at the northernmost end: <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">LC-34</a> and <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Space%20Launch%20Complex%2037">LC-37</a>. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at <a href="Merritt%20Island%2C%20Florida">Merritt Island</a>. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by <a href="Kurt%20H.%20Debus">Kurt H. Debus</a>, a member of Dr. <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>'s original <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a> engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.

The LOC included <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a>, a <a href="Launch%20Control%20Center">Launch Control Center</a>, and a 130 million cubic foot (3.7 million cubic meter) <a href="Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building">Vertical Assembly Building</a> (VAB) in which the space vehicle (launch vehicle and spacecraft) would be assembled on a <a href="Mobile%20Launcher%20Platform">Mobile Launcher Platform</a> and then moved by a <a href="Crawler-transporter">transporter</a> to one of several launch pads. Although at least three pads were planned, only two, designated A and B, were completed in October 1965. The LOC also included an <a href="Operations%20and%20Checkout%20Building">Operations and Checkout Building</a> (OCB) to which <a href="Project%20Gemini">Gemini</a> and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles. The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two <a href="vacuum%20chamber">vacuum chamber</a>s capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to , which is nearly a vacuum.

Administrator Webb realized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control, he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization, so he recruited Dr. <a href="George%20Mueller%20%28NASA%29">George E. Mueller</a> for a high management job. Mueller accepted, on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo. Webb then worked with Associate Administrator (later Deputy Administrator) Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). On July 23, 1963, Webb announced Mueller's appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, to replace then Associate Administrator <a href="D.%20Brainerd%20Holmes">D. Brainerd Holmes</a> on his retirement effective September 1. Under Webb's reorganization, the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center (Gilruth) <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (von Braun) and the Launch Operations Center (Debus) effectively reported to Mueller.

Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects, Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, so he got Webb's permission to recruit General <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Phillips">Samuel C. Phillips</a>, who gained a reputation for his effective management of the <a href="LGM-30%20Minuteman">Minuteman</a> program, as OMSF program controller. Phillips' superior officer <a href="Bernard%20Adolph%20Schriever">Bernard A. Schriever</a> agreed to loan Phillips to NASA, along with a staff of officers under him, on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director. Mueller agreed, and Phillips managed Apollo from January 1964, until it achieved the first manned landing in July 1969, after which he returned to Air Force duty.

Once Kennedy had defined a goal, the Apollo mission planners were faced with the challenge of designing a spacecraft that could meet it while minimizing risk to human life, cost, and demands on technology and astronaut skill. Four possible mission modes were considered:
In early 1961, direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA. Many engineers feared that a rendezvous—let alone a docking—neither of which had been attempted even in <a href="Geocentric%20orbit">Earth orbit</a>, would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit. Dissenters including <a href="John%20Houbolt">John Houbolt</a> at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke "somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.
Seamans' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E. Golovin in July 1961, to recommend a <a href="launch%20vehicle">launch vehicle</a> to be used in the Apollo program, represented a turning point in NASA's mission mode decision. This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice, and recommended in favor of a hybrid EOR-LOR mode. Its consideration of LOR—as well as Houbolt's ceaseless work—played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach. In late 1961 and early 1962, members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR, including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight, <a href="Joseph%20Francis%20Shea">Joseph Shea</a>, who became a champion of LOR. The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), which had much to lose from the decision, took longer to become convinced of its merits, but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing on June 7, 1962.

But even after NASA reached internal agreement, it was far from smooth sailing. Kennedy's <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">science advisor</a> <a href="Jerome%20Wiesner">Jerome Wiesner</a>, who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office, and had opposed the decision to land men on the Moon, hired Golovin, who had left NASA, to chair his own "Space Vehicle Panel", ostensibly to monitor, but actually to second-guess NASA's decisions on the <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> launch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea, Seamans, and even Webb to defend themselves, delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11, 1962, and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as "tentative".

Wiesner kept up the pressure, even making the disagreement public during a two-day September visit by the President to <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a>. Wiesner blurted out "No, that's no good" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was "still subject to final review". Webb held firm, and issued a <a href="request%20for%20proposal">request for proposal</a> to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb. NASA announced the selection of <a href="Grumman">Grumman</a> as the LEM contractor in November 1962.

Space historian James Hansen concludes that:
The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a "lifeboat" in the event of a failure of the command ship. Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. A 1964 MSC study concluded, "The <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">LM</a> [as lifeboat] ... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">CSM</a> failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Propulsion%20System">SPS</a>." Ironically, just such a failure happened on <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> when an oxygen tank explosion left the CSM without electrical power. The Lunar Module provided propulsion, electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.

Faget's preliminary Apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module, supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a "Command/Service Module" (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the "Lunar Excursion Module" (LEM, later shortened to "Lunar Module", LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.

The <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing. It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs. Its exterior was covered with an <a href="ablative%20heat%20shield">ablative heat shield</a>, and had its own <a href="reaction%20control%20system">reaction control system</a> (RCS) engines to <a href="attitude%20control">control its attitude</a> and steer its <a href="atmospheric%20entry">atmospheric entry</a> path. Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown. The module was tall, in diameter, and weighed approximately .

A cylindrical <a href="Apollo%20service%20module">Service Module</a> (SM) supported the Command Module, with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants, and a fuel cell power generation system with <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> and <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> reactants. A high-gain <a href="S%20band">S-band</a> antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights. On the extended lunar missions, an orbital scientific instrument package was carried. The Service Module was discarded just before re-entry. The module was long and in diameter. The initial lunar flight version weighed approximately fully fueled, while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over .

<a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> won the contract to build the CSM, and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.

The Lunar Module (LM) was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module. Not designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere or return to Earth, its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations, and was of an extremely lightweight construction. It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages, each with its own engine. The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant, surface stay consumables, and surface exploration equipment. The ascent stage contained the crew cabin, ascent propellant, and a reaction control system. The initial LM model weighed approximately , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours. An Extended Lunar Module weighed over , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days. The contract for design and construction of the Lunar Module was awarded to <a href="Grumman">Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation</a>, and the project was overseen by <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Kelly%20%28aerospace%20engineer%29">Thomas J. Kelly</a>.

Before the Apollo program began, Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles, the <a href="Saturn%20%28rocket%20family%29">Saturn series</a>, and the even larger <a href="Nova%20%28rocket%29">Nova</a> series. In the midst of these plans, von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA, and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center. The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over . The June 11, 1962, decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova, and the MSFC proceeded to develop the <a href="Saturn%20%28rocket%20family%29">Saturn rocket family</a> for Apollo.

Since Apollo, like Mercury, would require a <a href="launch%20escape%20system">launch escape system</a> (LES) in case of a launch failure, a relatively small rocket was required for qualification flight testing of this system. A size bigger than the NAA <a href="Little%20Joe%20%28rocket%29">Little Joe</a> would be required, so the <a href="Little%20Joe%20II">Little Joe II</a> was built by <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>/<a href="Convair">Convair</a>. After an August 1963 <a href="Little%20Joe%20II%20Qualification%20Test%20Vehicle">qualification test flight</a>, four LES test flights (<a href="A-001">A-001</a> through <a href="A-004">004</a>) were made at the <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a> between May 1964 and January 1966.

Since Apollo, like Mercury, used more than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle combination series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compare <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">Mercury-Redstone 3</a>, <a href="Mercury-Atlas%206">Mercury-Atlas 6</a>) to designate and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a>. This was changed by the time manned flights began.

Saturn I, the first US heavy lift launch vehicle, was initially planned to launch partially equipped CSMs in low Earth orbit tests. The <a href="S-I">S-I</a> first stage burned <a href="RP-1">RP-1</a> with liquid oxygen (LOX) oxidizer in eight clustered <a href="Rocketdyne%20H-1">Rocketdyne H-1</a> engines, to produce of thrust. The <a href="S-IV">S-IV</a> second stage used six liquid hydrogen-fueled <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20Rocketdyne">Pratt & Whitney</a> <a href="RL-10">RL-10</a> engines with of thrust. A planned <a href="Centaur%20%28rocket%20stage%29">Centaur</a> (S-V) third stage with two RL-10 engines never flew on Saturn I.

The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC-34, with only live first stages, carrying dummy upper stages filled with water. The first flight with a live S-IV was launched from LC-37. This was followed by five launches of <a href="Boilerplate%20%28spaceflight%29">boilerplate</a> CSMs (designated <a href="AS-101%20%28spacecraft%29">AS-101</a> through <a href="AS-105%20%28spacecraft%29">AS-105</a>) into orbit in 1964 and 1965. The last three of these further supported the Apollo program by also carrying <a href="Pegasus%20%28satellite%29">Pegasus</a> satellites, which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of <a href="micrometeorite">micrometeorite</a> impacts.

In September 1962, NASA planned to launch four manned CSM flights on the Saturn I from late 1965 through 1966, concurrent with Project Gemini. The payload capacity would have severely limited the systems which could be included, so the decision was made in October 1963 to use the uprated <a href="Saturn%20IB">Saturn IB</a> for all manned Earth orbital flights.

The Saturn IB was an upgraded version of the Saturn I. The <a href="S-IB">S-IB</a> first stage increased the thrust to by uprating the H-1 engine. The second stage replaced the S-IV with the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB-200</a>, powered by a single <a href="Rocketdyne%20J-2">J-2</a> engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with LOX, to produce of thrust. A restartable version of the S-IVB was used as the third stage of the Saturn V. The Saturn IB could send over into low Earth orbit, sufficient for a partially fueled CSM or the LM. Saturn IB launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-200 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "2" indicating the second member of the Saturn rocket family.

Saturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, "AS" indicating "Apollo Saturn" and the "5" indicating Saturn V. The three-stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon. It was in diameter and stood tall with its lunar payload. Its capability grew to for the later advanced lunar landings. The <a href="S-IC">S-IC</a> first stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of , which was upgraded to . The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen, and the third stage was a modified version of the S-IVB, with thrust increased to and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a <a href="parking%20orbit">parking orbit</a>.

NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations during the Apollo program was <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Donald K. "Deke" Slayton</a>, one of the original <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a> astronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a <a href="heart%20murmur">heart murmur</a>. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments.
Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth’s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on its surface, though none of them returned to the Moon after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32, <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, <a href="Edward%20Higgins%20White">Edward H. White</a>, and <a href="Roger%20B.%20Chaffee">Roger Chaffee</a> were killed during a ground test in preparation for their Apollo 1 mission.

The Apollo astronauts were chosen from the Project Mercury and Gemini veterans, plus from two later astronaut groups. All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans. Dr. <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a>, a geologist, was the first <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%204">NASA scientist astronaut</a> to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the <a href="geology%20of%20the%20moon">lunar geology</a> training of all of the Apollo landing crews.

NASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Distinguished Service Medal</a>, given for "distinguished service, ability, or courage", and personal "contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission". The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969, then to the crews of all missions from <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> onward. The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test mission <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a>, <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Walter M. Schirra</a>, <a href="Donn%20Eisele">Donn Eisele</a>, and <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a>, were awarded the lesser <a href="NASA%20Exceptional%20Service%20Medal">NASA Exceptional Service Medal</a>, because of discipline problems with the <a href="Flight%20controller%23Flight%20Director%20%28FLIGHT%29">Flight Director</a>'s orders during their flight. The NASA Administrator in October, 2008, decided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals, by this time posthumously to Schirra and Eisele.

The nominal planned lunar landing mission proceeded as follows:


Two Block I CSMs were launched from LC-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the Saturn IB. The first, <a href="AS-201">AS-201</a> launched on February 26, reached an altitude of and splashed down downrange in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The second, <a href="AS-202">AS-202</a> on August 25, reached altitude and was recovered downrange in the Pacific Ocean. These flights validated the Service Module engine and the Command Module heat shield.

A third Saturn IB test, <a href="AS-203">AS-203</a> launched from pad 37, went into orbit to support design of the S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.

Two manned orbital Block I CSM missions were planned: AS-204 and AS-205. The Block I crew positions were titled Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot. The Senior Pilot would assume navigation duties, while the Pilot would function as a systems engineer. The astronauts would wear <a href="Gemini%20space%20suit%23Apollo%20program">a modified version of the Gemini spacesuit</a>.

After an unmanned LM test flight AS-206, a crew would fly the first Block II CSM and LM in a dual mission known as AS-207/208, or AS-278 (each spacecraft would be launched on a separate Saturn IB). The Block II crew positions were titled Commander (CDR) Command Module Pilot (CMP) and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). The astronauts would begin wearing a new <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">Apollo A6L spacesuit</a>, designed to accommodate lunar <a href="extravehicular%20activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA). The traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear "fishbowl" type for greater visibility, and the lunar surface EVA suit would include a water-cooled undergarment.

<a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, the grounded <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury astronaut</a> who became Director of Flight Crew Operations for the Gemini and Apollo programs, selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookie <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn F. Eisele</a> as Pilot. But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the <a href="reduced%20gravity%20aircraft">KC135 weightlessness training aircraft</a>, and had to undergo surgery on January 27. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee. NASA announced the final crew selection for AS-204 on March 21, 1966, with the backup crew consisting of Gemini veterans <a href="James%20McDivitt">James McDivitt</a> and <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a>, with rookie <a href="Rusty%20Schweickart">Russell L. "Rusty" Schweickart</a>. Mercury/Gemini veteran <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, Eisele, and rookie <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a> were announced on September 29 as the prime crew for AS-205.

In December 1966, the AS-205 mission was canceled, since the validation of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.

The spacecraft for the AS-202 and AS-204 missions were delivered by North American Aviation to the Kennedy Space Center with long lists of equipment problems which had to be corrected before flight; these delays caused the launch of AS-202 to slip behind AS-203, and eliminated hopes the first manned mission might be ready to launch as soon as November 1966, concurrently with the last Gemini mission. Eventually the planned AS-204 flight date was pushed to February 21, 1967.

North American Aviation was prime contractor not only for the Apollo CSM, but for the Saturn V <a href="S-II">S-II</a> second stage as well, and delays in this stage pushed the first unmanned Saturn V flight AS-501 from late 1966 to November 1967. (The initial assembly of AS-501 had to use a dummy spacer spool in place of the stage.)

The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a "<a href="tiger%20team">tiger team</a>" to investigate North American's problems and identify corrections. Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA president <a href="Lee%20Atwood">Lee Atwood</a>, with a strongly worded letter by Mueller, and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans. Meanwhile, <a href="Grumman">Grumman</a> was also encountering problems with the Lunar Module, eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967, not long after the first manned CSM flights.

Grissom, White, and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight. They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. A "plugs-out" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power. If successful, this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled.

The plugs-out test began on the morning of January 27, 1967, and immediately was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.

NASA immediately convened an accident review board, overseen by both houses of Congress. While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex, the review board concluded that "deficiencies existed in Command Module design, workmanship and quality control." At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb, North American removed <a href="Harrison%20Storms">Harrison Storms</a> as Command Module program manager. Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) Manager <a href="Joseph%20Francis%20Shea">Joseph Francis Shea</a>, replacing him with <a href="George%20Low">George Low</a>.
To remedy the causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I <a href="plug%20door">plug-type</a> hatch cover with a quick-release, outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.

On April 24, 1967, Mueller published an official Apollo mission numbering scheme, using sequential numbers for all flights, manned or unmanned. The sequence would start with <a href="Apollo%204">Apollo 4</a> to cover the first three unmanned flights while retiring the Apollo 1 designation to honor the crew, per their widows' wishes.

In September 1967, Mueller approved a <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">sequence of mission types</a> which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing. Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed, and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary; therefore letters were used instead of numbers. The A missions were unmanned Saturn V validation; B was unmanned LM validation using the Saturn IB; C was manned CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB; D was the first manned CSM/LM flight (this replaced AS-258, using a single Saturn V launch); E would be a higher Earth orbit CSM/LM flight; F would be the first lunar mission, testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing (a "dress rehearsal"); and G would be the first manned landing. The list of types covered follow-on lunar exploration to include H lunar landings, I for lunar orbital survey missions, and J for extended-stay lunar landings.

The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.

<a href="Apollo%205">Apollo 5</a> (AS-204) was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a "fire-in-the-hole" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage. Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test, George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.

This was followed on April 4, 1968, by <a href="Apollo%206">Apollo 6</a> (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced <a href="pogo%20oscillation">pogo oscillation</a>, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.

<a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a>, launched from LC-34 on October 11, 1968, was the C mission, crewed by Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham. It was an 11-day Earth-orbital flight which tested the CSM systems.

<a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> was planned to be the D mission in December 1968, crewed by McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart, launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs. In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time. Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earth-orbiting mission, ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead, deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969, and eliminating the E mission. This would keep the program on track. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> had sent two tortoises, mealworms, wine flies, and other lifeforms around the Moon on September 15, 1968, aboard <a href="Zond%205">Zond 5</a>, and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts. The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7. Gemini veterans <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a> and <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>, and rookie <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a> captured the world's attention by making ten lunar orbits in 20 hours, transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, and returning safely to Earth.

The following March, LM flight, rendezvous and docking were successfully demonstrated in Earth orbit on <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a>, and Schweickart tested the full lunar EVA suit with its <a href="Primary%20Life%20Support%20System">Portable Life Support System</a> (PLSS) outside the LM. The F mission was successfully carried out on <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a> in May 1969 by Gemini veterans <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Stafford">Thomas P. Stafford</a>, <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John Young</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Cernan">Eugene Cernan</a>. Stafford and Cernan took the LM to within of the lunar surface.
The G mission was achieved on <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the <a href="Mare%20Tranquillitatis">Sea of Tranquility</a> at 20:17:40 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> on July 20, 1969. They spent a total of 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24.

In November 1969, Gemini veteran <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Charles "Pete" Conrad</a> and rookie <a href="Alan%20Bean">Alan L. Bean</a> made a precision landing on Apollo 12 within walking distance of the <a href="Surveyor%203">Surveyor 3</a> unmanned lunar probe, which had landed in April 1967 on the <a href="Ocean%20of%20Storms">Ocean of Storms</a>. The Command Module Pilot was Gemini veteran <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Richard F. Gordon Jr.</a> Conrad and Bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera, but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the Sun. They made two EVAs totaling 7 hours and 45 minutes. On one, they walked to the Surveyor, photographed it, and removed some parts which they returned to Earth.

The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander, with two rookies. Apollo 13 launched Lovell, <a href="Jack%20Swigert">Jack Swigert</a>, and <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> in April 1970, headed for the <a href="Fra%20Mauro%20formation">Fra Mauro formation</a>. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a "life boat" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications. Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.

The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L%23A7LB%20Spacesuit%20%28Apollo%2C%20Skylab%20and%20ASTP%29">revised for the extended missions</a> to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.

About the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a>. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Space%20Center">John F. Kennedy Space Center</a> on Merritt Island, Florida, <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">George C. Marshall Space Center</a> in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a>, Alabama, <a href="Michoud%20Assembly%20Facility">Michoud Assembly Facility</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Louisiana, and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center</a> in Houston, Texas.

The cutbacks forced mission planners to reassess the original planned landing sites in order to achieve the most effective geological sample and data collection from the remaining four missions. <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a> had been planned to be the last of the H series missions, but since there would be only two subsequent missions left, it was changed to the first of three J missions.

Apollo 13's Fra Mauro mission was reassigned to <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, commanded in February 1971 by Mercury veteran <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a>, with <a href="Stuart%20Roosa">Stuart Roosa</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Edgar Mitchell</a>. This time the mission was successful. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33 hours and 31 minutes on the surface, and completed two EVAs totalling 9 hours 24 minutes, which was a record for the longest EVA by a lunar crew at the time.

In August 1971, just after conclusion of the Apollo 15 mission, President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> proposed canceling the two remaining lunar landing missions, Apollo 16 and 17. <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a> Deputy Director <a href="Caspar%20Weinberger">Caspar Weinberger</a> was opposed to this, and persuaded Nixon to keep the remaining missions.

Apollo 15 was launched on July 26, 1971, with David Scott, <a href="Alfred%20Worden">Alfred Worden</a> and <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a>. Scott and Irwin landed on July 30 near <a href="Mons%20Hadley">Hadley Rille</a>, and spent just under two days, 19 hours on the surface. In over 18 hours of EVA, they collected about of lunar material.

Apollo 16 landed in the <a href="Descartes%20Highlands">Descartes Highlands</a> on April 20, 1972. The crew was commanded by John Young, with <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a> and <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a>. Young and Duke spent just under three days on the surface, with a total of over 20 hours EVA.

Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo program, landing in the <a href="Taurus-Littrow">Taurus-Littrow</a> region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan commanded <a href="Ronald%20Evans%20%28astronaut%29">Ronald E. Evans</a> and NASA's first scientist-astronaut, geologist Dr. <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison H. Schmitt</a>. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.

The Apollo program returned over of lunar rocks and <a href="lunar%20soil">soil</a> to the <a href="Lunar%20Receiving%20Laboratory">Lunar Receiving Laboratory</a> in Houston. Today, 75% of the samples are stored at the <a href="Lunar%20Sample%20Laboratory%20Facility">Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility</a> built in 1979.

The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a> techniques. They range in age from about 3.2 billion years for the <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic samples derived from the <a href="lunar%20mare">lunar maria</a>, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the <a href="Lunar%20highlands">highlands</a> crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the <a href="Genesis%20Rock">Genesis Rock</a>, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This <a href="anorthosite">anorthosite</a> rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral <a href="anorthite">anorthite</a>, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called <a href="KREEP">KREEP</a> was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see <a href="lunar%20magma%20ocean">lunar magma ocean</a>).

Almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects. Many samples appear to be pitted with <a href="micrometeoroid">micrometeoroid</a> impact craters, which is never seen on Earth rocks, due to the thick atmosphere. Many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of "impact melt" (materials melted near an impact crater.) All samples returned from the Moon are highly <a href="breccia">breccia</a>ted as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events.

Analysis of composition of the lunar samples supports the <a href="giant%20impact%20hypothesis">giant impact hypothesis</a>, that the Moon was created through impact of a large astronomical body with the Earth.

When President Kennedy first chartered the Moon landing program, a preliminary cost estimate of $7 billion was generated, but this proved an extremely unrealistic guess of what could not possibly be determined precisely, and James Webb used his judgment as administrator to change the estimate to $20 billion before giving it to Vice President Johnson.

When Kennedy made his 1962 speech at Rice University, the annual <a href="Budget%20of%20NASA">space budget</a> was $5.4 billion, and he described this cost as 40 cents per person per week, "somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year", but that the Moon program would soon raise this to "more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman and child in the United States".
Webb's estimate shocked many at the time (including the President) but ultimately proved to be reasonably accurate. In January 1969, NASA prepared an itemized estimate of the run-out cost of the Apollo program. The total came to $23.9 billion, itemized as follows:

The final cost of Apollo was reported to Congress as $25.4 billion in 1973, It took up the majority of NASA's budget while it was being developed. For example, in 1966 it accounted for about 60 percent of NASA's total $5.2 billion budget. That was one of the biggest investment of the US in science, research and development, and employed thousands of American scientists. A single Saturn V launch in 1969 cost up to $375 million, compared to the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>'s fiscal year 1970 budget of $440 million.

In 2009, NASA held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion. This included all <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations. This was based on a <a href="Congressional%20Budget%20Office">Congressional Budget Office</a> report, "A Budgetary Analysis of NASA's New Vision for Space", September 2004. "The Space Review" estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $20.4 billion, or $109 billion in 2010 dollars.

Looking beyond the manned lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series ("Apollo X",) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29%23Spacecraft%20Lunar%20Module%20Adapter%20%28SLA%29">Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter</a> (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage, and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the <a href="Apollo%20Telescope%20Mount">Apollo Telescope Mount</a>, which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack. The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a <a href="Manned%20Venus%20Flyby">Venus fly-by mission</a>.

The S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. Dubbed <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a>, it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount. Skylab's last crew departed the station on February 8, 1974, and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.

The <a href="Apollo-Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo-Soyuz Test Project</a> also used Apollo hardware for the first joint nation space flight, paving the way for future cooperation with other nations in the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> and <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> programs.

In September 2007, the <a href="X%20Prize%20Foundation">X PRIZE Foundation</a> and <a href="Google">Google</a> announced the <a href="Google%20Lunar%20X%20Prize">Google Lunar X Prize</a>, to be awarded for a robotic lunar landing mission which transmits close-up images of the Apollo Lunar Modules and <a href="List%20of%20artificial%20objects%20on%20the%20Moon">other artificial objects on the surface</a>.

In 2008, <a href="Japan%20Aerospace%20Exploration%20Agency">Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency</a>'s <a href="SELENE">SELENE</a> probe observed evidence of the halo surrounding the Apollo 15 Lunar Module blast crater while orbiting above the lunar surface. In 2009, NASA's <a href="robotic%20spacecraft">robotic</a> <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>, while orbiting above the Moon, began photographing the remnants of the Apollo program left on the lunar surface, and photographed each site where manned Apollo flights landed. All of the U. S. flags left on the Moon during the Apollo missions were found to still be standing, with the exception of the one left during the Apollo 11 mission, which was blown over during that mission's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission Command Module in lunar orbit; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown.

In a November 16, 2009 editorial, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" opined:

The Apollo program has been called the greatest technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The <a href="Apollo%20Guidance%20Computer">flight computer</a> design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the <a href="UGM-27%20Polaris">Polaris</a> and <a href="LGM-30%20Minuteman">Minuteman</a> missile systems, the driving force behind early research into <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an Apollo mission was unacceptably high.

The crew of Apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Genesis">pageRank.Book of Genesis</a>, on Christmas Eve 1968. An estimated one quarter of the population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the Christmas Eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon, and an estimated one fifth of the population of the world watched the live transmission of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.
The Apollo program also affected <a href="environmental%20activism">environmental activism</a> in the 1970s due to photos taken by the astronauts. The most famous, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is <a href="The%20Blue%20Marble">The Blue Marble</a>. This image, which was released during a surge in environmentalism, became a symbol of the environmental movement, as a depiction of Earth's frailty, vulnerability, and isolation amid the vast expanse of space.

According to "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>", Apollo succeeded in accomplishing President Kennedy's goal of taking on the Soviet Union in the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased the superiority of the capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.

There are those who, despite evidence to the contrary, deny that the moon landings took place. The Apollo <a href="Moon%20landing%20conspiracy%20theories">moon landing hoax</a> claims helped propel <a href="List%20of%20conspiracy%20theories">conspiracy theories</a> into a quasi-political narrative.

As part of Apollo 11's 40th anniversary in 2009, NASA spearheaded an effort to digitally restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally erased.

The Moon landing data was recorded by a special <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">Apollo TV camera</a> which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV. This resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes. During the following years, a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a> to be recorded over with newer satellite data. Stan Lebar, who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20%281886%29">Westinghouse Electric Corporation</a>, also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.

With a budget of $230,000, the surviving original lunar broadcast data from Apollo 11 was compiled by Nafzger and assigned to <a href="Lowry%20Digital">Lowry Digital</a> for restoration. The video was processed to remove random noise and camera shake without destroying historical legitimacy. The images were from tapes in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a> archive, and <a href="kinescope">kinescope</a> recordings made at Johnson Space Center. The restored video, remaining in black and white, contains conservative digital enhancements and did not include sound quality improvements.

Numerous documentary films cover the Apollo program and the Space Race, including:

The Apollo program, or certain missions, have been <a href="docudrama">dramatized</a> in "<a href="Apollo%2013%20%28film%29">Apollo 13</a>" (1995), "<a href="Apollo%2011%20%28film%29">Apollo 11</a>" (1996), "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">From the Earth to the Moon</a>" (1998), "<a href="The%20Dish">The Dish</a>" (2000), "<a href="Space%20Race%20%28TV%20series%29">Space Race</a>" (2005), and "<a href="Moonshot%20%28film%29">Moonshot</a>" (2009).

Assault

In criminal and civil law, assault is an attempt to initiate harmful or offensive contact with a person, or a threat to do so. It is distinct from <a href="Battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>, which refers to the actual achievement of such contact.

An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm. It is both a <a href="crime">crime</a> and a <a href="tort">tort</a> and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and tort law. There is, however, an additional criminal law category of assault consisting of an attempted but unsuccessful battery. The term is often confused with <a href="Battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>, which involves physical contact. The specific meaning of assault varies between countries, but can refer to an act that causes another to apprehend immediate and personal violence, or in the more limited sense of a threat of violence caused by an immediate show of force. Assault in many US jurisdictions and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> is defined more broadly still as any intentional physical contact with another person without their consent; but in <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> and in most other <a href="common%20law">common law</a> jurisdictions in the world, this is defined instead as <a href="battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>. Some jurisdictions have incorporated the definition of civil assault into the definition of the crime making it a criminal assault intentionally to cause another person to apprehend a harmful or offensive contact.

Assault usually accompanies <a href="Battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a> if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See <a href="common%20assault">common assault</a>. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact. Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting him is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

<a href="Aggravation%20%28legal%20concept%29">Aggravated</a> assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a <a href="deadly%20weapon">deadly weapon</a>. A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as <a href="de%20minimis">de minimis</a> harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

<a href="consent%20%28criminal%20law%29">Consent</a> may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault. This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual <a href="sadomasochism">sadomasochistic sexual activity</a>, the most notable case being the <a href="Operation%20Spanner">Operation Spanner</a> case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game (<a href="Mixed%20martial%20arts">Mixed martial arts</a>, <a href="wrestling">wrestling</a>, <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, or <a href="contact%20sports">contact sports</a>), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay (Jones and others). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.

<a href="Police%20officers">Police officers</a> and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an <a href="arrest">arrest</a> or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

In some jurisdictions such as <a href="Caning%20in%20Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="judicial%20corporal%20punishment">judicial corporal punishment</a> is part of the <a href="legal%20system">legal system</a>. The officers who administer the punishment have <a href="Sovereign%20immunity">immunity</a> from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, <a href="Corporal%20punishment%20in%20the%20home%23Where%20corporal%20punishment%20in%20the%20home%20is%20lawful">corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian</a> is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and <a href="case%20law">case law</a>. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>.

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for <a href="School%20corporal%20punishment">children in school</a>. In <a href="English%20law">English law</a>, s58 <a href="Children%20Act%202004">Children Act 2004</a>, limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s39 <a href="Criminal%20Justice%20Act%201988">Criminal Justice Act 1988</a>.

This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in <a href="Defence%20of%20property">defense of property</a>, to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 <a href="Criminal%20Damage%20Act%201971">Criminal Damage Act 1971</a> it may be argued that the defendant has a "lawful excuse" to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Act%201967">Criminal Law Act 1967</a>) subject to the need to deter <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a>s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that he felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.

Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the Canadian <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a>. There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code. This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:


An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16, sections 351 through 358.
The Code further explains that ""mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault."" Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault. Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.

Marshall Islands

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code. A person is guilty of this offence if he unlawfully offers or attempts, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

Section 2 of the <a href="Non-Fatal%20Offences%20against%20the%20Person%20Act%201997">Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997</a> creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of <a href="assault%20causing%20harm">assault causing harm</a>.

<a href="South%20African%20law">South African law</a> does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. "Assault" is a <a href="common%20law%20crime">common law crime</a> defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him." The law also recognises the crime of "assault with intent to cause <a href="grievous%20bodily%20harm">grievous bodily harm</a>", where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health." The common law crime of "<a href="indecent%20assault">indecent assault</a>" was repealed by the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20%28Sexual%20Offences%20and%20Related%20Matters%29%20Amendment%20Act%2C%202007">Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007</a>, and replaced by a statutory crime of "<a href="sexual%20assault">sexual assault</a>".










Abolished offence:


English law provides for two offences of assault: <a href="common%20assault">common assault</a> and <a href="battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. "Violence" in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of <a href="battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>, even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the <a href="Criminal%20Justice%20Act%201988">Criminal Justice Act 1988</a>.

A <a href="common%20assault">common assault</a> is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the <a href="Magistrates%27%20Court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">magistrates' court</a> in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the <a href="Crown%20Court">Crown Court</a>). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.















In <a href="Scots%20Law">Scots Law</a>, assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another". There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a "physical" attack on another's person, as demonstrated in "Atkinson v. <a href="Lord%20Advocate">HM Advocate</a>" wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a <a href="ski%20mask">ski mask</a>. The court said:

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or "Hamesuken" (to assault a person in his own home). The "<a href="mens%20rea">mens rea</a>" for assault is simply "evil intent", although this has been held to mean no more than that assault ""cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently"" as upheld in "<a href="Lord%20Advocate%27s%20Reference">Lord Advocate's Reference</a> No 2 of 1992" where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of his duty, under Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (Previously Section 41 of the <a href="Police%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201967">Police (Scotland) Act 1967</a> which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The <a href="Offences%20against%20the%20Person%20Act%201861">Offences against the Person Act 1861</a> creates the offences of:
The <a href="Criminal%20Justice%20%28Miscellaneous%20Provisions%29%20Act%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29%201968">Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968</a> creates the offences of:

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under secction 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the <a href="Police%20%28Northern%20Ireland%29%20Act%201998">Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998</a> (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

The term ‘assault’, when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900 defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

Assault with further specific intent
Assault causing certain injuries 

American <a href="common%20law">common law</a> has defined assault as an attempt to commit a <a href="battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>.

Assault is typically treated as a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> and not as a <a href="felony">felony</a> (unless it involves a <a href="Police">law enforcement</a> officer). The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at common law:

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as <a href="Battery%20%28crime%29">battery</a>, <a href="menacing">menacing</a>, <a href="intimidation">intimidation</a>, <a href="reckless%20endangerment">reckless endangerment</a> etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as exemplified below.

In <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> assault is defined as follows:

39-13-101. Assault.

In <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> the law on assault states:

<a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> law states:

Simple assault.

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double <a href="inchoate%20offense">inchoate offense</a>.

In some states, <a href="consent%20%28criminal%20law%29">consent</a> is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a "petty misdemeanor".

In New York State assault as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120, requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery. There is no crime of battery in New York. The threat of imminent injury without physical contact in New York is called Menacing. New York also has specific laws against Hazing when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the <a href="Unborn%20Victims%20of%20Violence%20Act">Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004</a> treats the <a href="fetus">fetus</a> as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See <a href="http%3A//www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf">H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212</a>

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:

Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed <a href="hubris">hubris</a>. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening <a href="pride">pride</a>, self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included what would today be termed assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property. Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, a prominent statesman and orator in ancient <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. <a href="At%C3%AB">Atë</a>, Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of his/her hubris, or great pride, that leads to his/her death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a <a href="zero-sum">zero-sum</a> game. <a href="Rush%20Rehm">Rush Rehm</a> simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

Alfheim (, "Land Of The Elves" or "Elfland"), also called Ljosalfheim ("Ljósálf[a]heimr", "home of the <a href="Lj%C3%B3s%C3%A1lfar">light-elves</a>"), is one of the <a href="Norse%20cosmology">Nine Worlds</a> and home of the <a href="Elf%23Old_Norse_texts">Light Elves</a> in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>.

Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> texts.

The <a href="eddic%20poem">eddic poem</a> "<a href="Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l">Grímnismál</a>" describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza 5 with:
<a href="%C3%9Ddalir">Ýdalir</a> call they     the place where <a href="Ullr">Ull</a>
A hall for himself hath set;
And Álfheim the gods     to <a href="Freyr">Frey</a> once gave
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an <a href="infant">infant</a> on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>", <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called "<a href="lj%C3%B3s%C3%A1lfar">ljósálfar</a>" [Light Elves]; but the "<a href="d%C3%B6kk%C3%A1lfar">dökkálfar</a>" [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.

The account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called <a href="Giml%C3%A9">Gimlé</a> that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called <a href="Andlang">Andlang</a> ["Andlangr" 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called <a href="V%C3%ADdbl%C3%A1in">Vídbláin</a> ["Vídbláinn" 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin ("Vindbláinn" 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds ("heima") mentioned in stanza 2 of the eddic poem "<a href="V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1">Völuspá</a>".

Ask and Embla

In <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, Ask and Embla (from <a href="Old%20Norse%20language">Old Norse</a> "Askr ok Embla")—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the "<a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the "<a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>", written in the 13th century by <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>. In both sources, <a href="Numbers%20in%20Germanic%20paganism">three</a> gods, one of whom is <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.

<a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "askr" literally means "<a href="fraxinus%20excelsior">ash tree</a>" but the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of "embla" is uncertain, and two possibilities of the meaning of "embla" are generally proposed. The first meaning, "<a href="Ulmus%20glabra">elm tree</a>", is problematic, and is reached by deriving "*Elm-la" from "*Almilōn" and subsequently to "almr" ("elm"). The second suggestion is "<a href="vine">vine</a>", which is reached through "*Ambilō", which may be related to the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> term "ámpelos", itself meaning "vine, <a href="liana">liana</a>". The latter etymology has resulted in a number of theories.

According to <a href="Benjamin%20Thorpe">Benjamin Thorpe</a> "<a href="Jacob%20Grimm">Grimm</a> says the word embla, emla, signifies a busy woman, from amr, ambr, aml, ambl, assiduous labour; the same relation as <a href="Mashya%20and%20Mashyana">Meshia and Meshiane</a>, the <a href="Iranian%20religion">ancient Persian</a> names of the first man and woman, who were also formed from trees."

In stanza 17 of the "Poetic Edda" poem "<a href="V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1">Völuspá</a>", the <a href="v%C3%B6lva">völva</a> reciting the Poem states that <a href="H%C5%93nir">Hœnir</a>, <a href="L%C3%B3%C3%B0urr">Lóðurr</a> and <a href="Odin">Odin</a> once found Ask and Embla on Land. The Völva says that the two were capable of very little, lacking in "<a href="wyrd">ørlög</a>" and says that they were given three gifts by the three Gods:

The meaning of these gifts has been a matter of scholarly disagreement and translations therefore vary.

According to chapter 9 of the "Prose Edda" book "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>", the three brothers <a href="Vili%20and%20V%C3%A9">Vili, Vé</a>, and Odin, are the creators of the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go on to become the progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a>.

A <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Proto-Indo-European</a> basis has been theorized for the duo based on the etymology of "embla" meaning "vine." In Indo-European societies, an analogy is derived from the drilling of fire and <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>. Vines were used as a flammable wood, where they were placed beneath a drill made of harder wood, resulting in fire. Further evidence of ritual making of fire in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> has been theorized from a depiction on a stone plate on a <a href="The%20King%27s%20Grave">Bronze Age grave in Kivik</a>, <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>.

<a href="Jaan%20Puhvel">Jaan Puhvel</a> comments that "ancient myths teem with trite 'first couples' of the type of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and his by-product Eve</a>. In Indo-European tradition, these range from the Vedic Yama and Yamī and the Iranian Mašya and Mašyānag to the Icelandic Askr and Embla, with trees or rocks as preferred raw material, and <a href="dragon">dragon</a>'s teeth or other bony substance occasionally thrown in for good measure".

In his study of the comparative evidence for an origin of mankind from trees in Indo-European society, Anders Hultgård observes that "myths of the origin of mankind from trees or wood seem to be particularly connected with ancient Europe and Indo-Europe and Indo-European-speaking peoples of Asia Minor and Iran. By contrast the cultures of the Near East show almost exclusively the type of anthropogonic stories that derive man's origin from clay, earth or blood by means of a divine creation act".

Two wooden figures—the <a href="Braak%20Bog%20Figures">Braak Bog Figures</a>—of "more than human height" were unearthed from a <a href="peat%20bog">peat bog</a> at <a href="Braak">Braak</a> in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Schleswig">Schleswig</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. The figures depict a nude male and a nude female. <a href="Hilda%20Ellis%20Davidson">Hilda Ellis Davidson</a> comments that these figures may represent a "Lord and Lady" of the <a href="Vanir">Vanir</a>, a group of Norse gods, and that "another memory of [these wooden deities] may survive in the tradition of the creation of Ask and Embla, the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore".

A figure named <a href="Oisc%20of%20Kent">Æsc</a> (<a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> "ash tree") appears as the son of <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengest</a> in the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> genealogy for the kings of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. This has resulted in an amount of theories that the figures may have had an earlier basis in pre-Norse <a href="Germanic%20mythology">Germanic mythology</a>.

Connections have been proposed between Ask and Embla and the <a href="Vandals">Vandal</a> kings Assi and Ambri, attested in <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a>'s 7th century AD work "<a href="Origo%20Gentis%20Langobardorum">Origo Gentis Langobardorum</a>". There, the two ask the god <a href="W%C5%8Ddanaz">Godan</a> (Odin) for victory. The name "Ambri", like Embla, likely derives from "*Ambilō".

A stanza preceding the account of the creation of Ask and Embla in "Völuspá" provides a catalog of <a href="Dwarf%20%28Germanic%20mythology%29">dwarfs</a>, and stanza 10 has been considered as describing the creation of human forms from the earth. This may potentially mean that dwarfs formed humans, and that the three gods gave them life. Carolyne Larrington theorizes that humans are metaphorically designated as trees in Old Norse works (examples include "trees of jewellery" for women and "trees of battle" for men) due to the origin of humankind stemming from trees; Ask and Embla.

Ask and Embla have been the subject of a number of references and artistic depictions. A sculpture depicting the two stands in the southern Swedish city of <a href="S%C3%B6lvesborg">Sölvesborg</a>, created in 1948 by Stig Blomberg. Ask and Embla are depicted on two of the sixteen wooden panels found on the <a href="Oslo%20City%20Hall">Oslo City Hall</a> in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, by <a href="Dagfin%20Werenskiold">Dagfin Werenskiold</a>. In 2003, <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroese</a> artist <a href="Anker%20Eli%20Petersen">Anker Eli Petersen</a> included a depiction of the couple in his series of Faroe Islands stamps.
In <a href="A.S.%20Byatt">A.S. Byatt</a>'s novel <a href="Possession%20%28Byatt%20novel%29">Possession</a>, one of the characters is a poet who writes a series of verses about Ask and Embla.

Alabama River

The Alabama River, in the U.S. state of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, is formed by the <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa</a> and <a href="Coosa%20River">Coosa</a> rivers, which unite about north of <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>, near the suburb of <a href="Wetumpka%2C%20Alabama">Wetumpka</a>

The river flows west to <a href="Selma%2C%20Alabama">Selma</a>, then southwest until, about from <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, it unites with the <a href="Tombigbee%20River">Tombigbee</a>, forming the <a href="Mobile%20River">Mobile</a> and <a href="Tensaw%20River">Tensaw</a> rivers, which discharge into <a href="Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a>.

The course of the Alabama is very meandering. Its width varies from , and its depth from . Its length as measured by the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> is , and by <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> measurement, .

The river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state. Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama.

After the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the <a href="Cahaba%20River">Cahaba River</a>, which is about long and joins the Alabama River about below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from <a href="Rome%2C%20Georgia">Rome, Georgia</a>, to about above <a href="Wetumpka%2C%20Alabama">Wetumpka</a> (about below Rome and below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.

The navigation of the Tallapoosa River – which has its source in <a href="Paulding%20County%2C%20Georgia">Paulding County, Georgia</a>, and is about long – is prevented by <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s and a fall at <a href="Tallassee%2C%20Alabama">Tallassee</a>, a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.

The river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.

Discovered in 1712, the Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the <a href="Creek%20people">Creek Indians</a> before their <a href="Indian%20Removal">removal</a> by United States forces to the <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a> in the 1830s.

The <a href="Edmund%20Pettus%20Bridge">Edmund Pettus Bridge</a> crosses the Alabama River near <a href="Selma%2C%20Alabama">Selma</a>. The bridge was the site of a civil rights march in 1965.

The Alabama River has three lock and dams between Montgomery and the Mobile River. The Robert F. Henry Lock & Dam is located at river mile 236.2, the Millers Ferry Lock & Dam is located at river mile 133.0, and the Claiborne Lock & Dam is located at river mile 72.5.

Alain de Lille

Alain de Lille (or Alanus ab Insulis) ( 11281202/03) was a French <a href="theology">theologian</a> and <a href="poet">poet</a>. He was born in <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, some time before 1128. His exact date of death remains unclear as well, with most research pointing toward it being between April 14, 1202, and April 5, 1203.

Little is known of his life, however it is clear that Alan entered the schools no earlier than the late 1140s; first attending the school at <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, and then at <a href="Chartres">Chartres</a>. He probably studied under masters such as <a href="Peter%20Abelard">Peter Abelard</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20of%20Poitiers">Gilbert of Poitiers</a>, and <a href="Thierry%20of%20Chartres">Thierry of Chartres</a>. This is known through the writings of <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a>, who is thought to have been a near exact contemporary student of Alan of Lille. His earliest writings were probably written in the 1150s, and probably in Paris. Alan spent many years teaching at the school in Paris and he attended the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Lateran Council</a> in 1179. Though the only accounts of his lectures seem to show a sort of eccentric style and approach, he was said to have been good friends with many other masters at the school in Paris, and taught there, as well as some time in southern France, into his old age. He afterwards inhabited <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a> (he is sometimes called Alanus de Montepessulano), lived for a time outside the walls of any cloister, and finally retired to <a href="C%C3%AEteaux">Cîteaux</a>, where he died in 1202.

He had a very widespread reputation during his lifetime and his knowledge, more varied than profound, caused him to be called "Doctor Universalis". Many of Alan’s writings are unable to be exactly dated, and the circumstances and details surrounding his writing are often unknown as well. However, it does seem clear that his first notable work, "<a href="Summa%20Quoniam%20Homines">Summa Quoniam Homines</a>", was completed somewhere between 1155 and 1165, with the most conclusive date being 1160, and was probably developed through his lectures at the school in Paris. Among his very numerous works two poems entitle him to a distinguished place in the <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin literature</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>; one of these, the "De planctu naturae", is an ingenious satire on the vices of humanity. He created the allegory of grammatical "conjugation" which was to have its successors throughout the Middle Ages. The "Anticlaudianus", a treatise on morals as <a href="Medieval%20allegory">allegory</a>, the form of which recalls the pamphlet of Claudian against Rufinus, is agreeably versified and relatively pure in its latinity.

As a theologian Alain de Lille shared in the mystic reaction of the second half of the 12th century against the <a href="Scholasticism">scholastic philosophy</a>. His <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, however, is far from being as absolute as that of the <a href="Victorines">Victorines</a>. In the "Anticlaudianus" he sums up as follows: Reason, guided by prudence, can unaided discover most of the truths of the physical order; for the apprehension of religious truths it must trust to faith. This rule is completed in his treatise, "Ars catholicae fidei", as follows: Theology itself may be demonstrated by reason. Alain even ventures an immediate application of this principle, and tries to prove geometrically the dogmas defined in the <a href="Creed">Creed</a>. This bold attempt is entirely factitious and verbal, and it is only his employment of various terms not generally used in such a connection (<a href="axiom">axiom</a>, <a href="theorem">theorem</a>, <a href="corollary">corollary</a>, etc.) that gives his treatise its apparent originality.

Alan’s philosophy was a sort of mixture of <a href="Aristotelian%20logic">Aristotelian logic</a> and <a href="Neoplatonic">Neoplatonic</a> philosophy. The Platonist seemed to outweigh the Aristotelian in Alan, but he felt strongly that the divine is all intelligibility and argued this notion through much Aristotelian logic combined with <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagorean</a> mathematics.

One of Alan's most notable works was one he modeled after <a href="Boethius">Boethius</a>’ "<a href="Consolation%20of%20Philosophy">Consolation of Philosophy</a>", to which he gave the title "<a href="De%20Planctu%20Naturae">De Planctu Naturae</a>", or "The Plaint of Nature", and which was most likely written in the late 1160s. In this work, Alan uses prose and verse to illustrate the way in which nature defines its own position as inferior to that of God. He also attempts to illustrate the way in which humanity, through sexual perversion and specifically homosexuality, has defiled itself from nature and God. In "<a href="Anticlaudianus">Anticlaudianus</a>", another of his notable works, Alan uses a poetical dialogue to illustrate the way in which nature comes to the realization of her failure in producing the perfect man. She has only the ability to create a soulless body, and thus she is “persuaded to undertake the journey to heaven to ask for a soul,” and “the Seven Liberal Arts produce a chariot for her... the Five Senses are the horses”. The "Anticlaudianus" was translated into French and German in the following century, and toward 1280 was re-worked into a musical anthology by <a href="Adam%20de%20la%20Bass%C3%A9e">Adam de la Bassée</a>. One of Alan’s most popular and widely distributed works is his manual on preaching, "<a href="Ars%20Praedicandi">Ars Praedicandi</a>", or "The Art of Preaching". This work shows how Alan saw theological education as being a fundamental preliminary step in preaching and strove to give clergyman a manuscript to be “used as a practical manual” when it came to the formation of sermons and art of preaching.

Alan wrote three very large theological textbooks, one being his first work, "<a href="Summa%20Quoniam%20Homines">Summa Quoniam Homines</a>". Another of his theological textbooks that strove to be more minute in its focus, is his "<a href="De%20Fide%20Catholica">De Fide Catholica</a>", dated somewhere between 1185 and 1200, Alan sets out to refute heretical views, specifically that of the <a href="Waldensians">Waldensians</a> and <a href="Cathars">Cathars</a>. In his third theological textbook, "<a href="Regulae%20Caelestis%20Iuris">Regulae Caelestis Iuris</a>", he presents a set of what seems to be theological rules; this was typical of the followers of <a href="Gilbert%20of%20Poitiers">Gilbert of Poitiers</a>, of which Alan could be associated. Other than these theological textbooks, and the aforementioned works of the mixture of prose and poetry, Alan of Lille had numerous other works on numerous subjects, primarily including <a href="Speculative%20Theology">Speculative Theology</a>, <a href="Theoretical%20Moral%20Theology">Theoretical Moral Theology</a>, <a href="Practical%20Moral%20Theology">Practical Moral Theology</a>, and various collections of poems.

Alain de Lille has often been confounded with other persons named Alain, in particular with another Alanus (<a href="Alain%2C%20bishop%20of%20Auxerre">Alain, bishop of Auxerre</a>), Alan, abbot of Tewkesbury, Alain de Podio, etc. Certain facts of their lives have been attributed to him, as well as some of their works: thus the "Life of St Bernard" should be ascribed to Alain of Auxerre and the "Commentary upon Merlin" to <a href="Alan%2C%20abbot%20of%20Tewkesbury">Alan of Tewkesbury</a>. Alan of Lille was not the author of a "Memoriale rerum difficilium", published under his name, nor of "<a href="Moralium%20dogma%20philosophorum">Moralium dogma philosophorum</a>", nor of the satirical "<a href="Apocalypse%20of%20Golias">Apocalypse of Golias</a>" once attributed to him; and it is exceedingly doubtful whether the "Dicta Alani de lapide philosophico" really issued from his pen. On the other hand, it now seems practically demonstrated that Alain de Lille was the author of the "Ars catholicae fidei" and the treatise "Contra haereticos".

In his sermons on capital sins, Alain argued that <a href="sodomy">sodomy</a> and homicide are the most serious sins, since they call forth the wrath of God, which led to the destruction of <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>. His chief work on penance, the "Liber poenitenitalis" dedicated to <a href="Henry%20de%20Sully">Henry de Sully</a>, exercised great influence on the many manuals of penance produced as a result of the <a href="Fourth%20Lateran%20Council">Fourth Lateran Council</a>. Alain's identification of the sins against nature included <a href="bestiality">bestiality</a>, <a href="masturbation">masturbation</a>, oral and anal intercourse, <a href="incest">incest</a>, <a href="adultery">adultery</a> and <a href="rape">rape</a>. In addition to his battle against moral decay, Alan wrote a work against <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> and Christian heretics dedicated to William VIII of <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>.

Alemanni

The Alemanni (also "Alamanni"; "Suebi" "Swabians") were a confederation of <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic tribe</a>s on the <a href="upper%20Rhine">upper Rhine</a> river. First mentioned by <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> in the context of the campaign of <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> of 213, the Alemanni captured the <a href="Agri%20Decumates">Agri Decumates</a> in 260, and later expanded into present-day <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a>, and northern <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, leading to the establishment of the <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> language in those regions.

In 496, the Alemanni were <a href="Battle%20of%20Tolbiac">conquered</a> by <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> leader <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis</a> and incorporated into his <a href="Frankish%20Empire">dominions</a>. Mentioned as still <a href="Germanic%20paganism">pagan</a> allies of the <a href="Germanic%20Christianity">Christian</a> Franks, the Alemanni were gradually Christianized during the 7th century. The "<a href="Lex%20Alamannorum">Lex Alamannorum</a>" is a record of their customary law during this period. Until the 8th century, Frankish <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> over Alemannia was mostly nominal. But after an uprising by <a href="Theudebald%2C%20Duke%20of%20Alamannia">Theudebald, Duke of Alamannia</a>, <a href="Carloman%20I">Carloman</a> executed the Alamannic nobility and installed Frankish dukes. 
During the later and weaker years of the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a> the Alemannic counts became almost independent, and a struggle for supremacy took place between them and the <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Constance">Bishopric of Constance</a>. The chief family in Alamannia was that of the counts of <a href="Raetia%20Curiensis">Raetia Curiensis</a>, who were sometimes called margraves, and one of whom, <a href="Burchard%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Swabia">Burchard II</a>, established the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Swabia">Duchy of Swabia</a>, which was recognized by <a href="Henry%20the%20Fowler">Henry the Fowler</a> in 919 and became a <a href="stem%20duchy">stem duchy</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>.

The area settled by the Alemanni corresponds roughly to the area where <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic German</a> dialects remain spoken, including German <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a> and <a href="Baden">Baden</a>, French <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a>, <a href="German-speaking%20Switzerland">German-speaking Switzerland</a> and Austrian <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>. Their name has survived into modern times, for example: The word for <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in <a href="French%20language">French</a> "Allemagne", <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> "Alemania", <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> "Alemanha", <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> "Alman", <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> "Almanya" and <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "Yr Almaen" all derive from Alemanni.

According to <a href="Gaius%20Asinius%20Quadratus">Gaius Asinius Quadratus</a> (quoted in the mid-6th century by Byzantine historian <a href="Agathias">Agathias</a>) their name means "all men". It indicates that they were a conglomeration drawn from various Germanic tribes. Other sources say the name alemannen derives from alahmannen which means "men of sanctuary" and not "all men" (Sir Francis Palgrave) and other very old Urgermanic wisdom. The Romans and the Greeks called them as such mentioned. This was the derivation of "Alemanni" used by <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>, in his "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" and by the anonymous contributor of notes assembled from the papers of <a href="Nicolas%20Fr%C3%A9ret">Nicolas Fréret</a>, published in 1753, who noted that it was the name used by outsiders for those who called themselves the "<a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>". This etymology has remained the standard derivation of the term.

<a href="Walafrid%20Strabo">Walafrid Strabo</a>, a monk of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20St.%20Gall">Abbey of St. Gall</a> writing in the 9th century, remarked, in discussing the people of Switzerland and the surrounding regions, that only foreigners called them the "Alemanni", but that they gave themselves the name of "Suebi".

The name of Germany and the German language in several languages is derived from the name of this early Germanic tribal alliance. For details, see <a href="Names%20of%20Germany">Names of Germany</a>.

The Alemanni were first mentioned by <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> describing the campaign of <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> in 213. At that time they apparently dwelt in the basin of the <a href="Main%20River">Main</a>, to the south of the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a>.

<a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> (78.13.4) portrays the Alemanni as victims of this treacherous emperor. They had asked for his help, says Dio, but instead he colonized their country, changed their place names and executed their warriors under a pretext of coming to their aid. When he became ill, the Alemanni claimed to have put a hex on him (78.15.2). Caracalla, it was claimed, tried to counter this influence by invoking his ancestral spirits.

In retribution Caracalla then led the <a href="Legio%20II%20Traiana%20Fortis">Legio II "Traiana Fortis"</a> against the Alemanni, who lost and were pacified for a time. The legion was as a result honored with the name "Germanica". The 4th-century fictional <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a>, "Life of Antoninus Caracalla", relates (10.5) that Caracalla then assumed the name "Alemannicus", at which Helvius Pertinax jested that he should really be called "Geticus Maximus", because in the year before he had murdered his brother, <a href="Publius%20Septimius%20Geta">Geta</a>.

Through much of his short reign Caracalla was known for unpredictable and arbitrary operations launched by surprise after a pretext of peace negotiations. If he had any reasons of state for such actions they remained unknown to his contemporaries. Whether or not the Alemanni had been previously neutral, they were certainly further influenced by Caracalla to become thereafter notoriously implacable enemies of Rome.

This mutually antagonistic relationship is perhaps the reason why the Roman writers persisted in calling the Alemanni "barbari", "savages". The archaeology, however, shows that they were largely Romanized, lived in Roman-style houses and used Roman artifacts, the Alemannic women having adopted the Roman fashion of the "<a href="tunic">tunic</a>" even earlier than the men.

Most of the Alemanni were probably at the time in fact resident in or close to the borders of <a href="Germania%20Superior">Germania Superior</a>. Although Dio is the earliest writer to mention them, <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> used the name to refer to Germans on the <a href="Limes%20Germanicus">Limes Germanicus</a> in the time of <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>'s governorship of the province shortly after it was formed, c. 98/99. At that time the entire frontier was being fortified for the first time. Trees from the earliest fortifications found in <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a> are dated by <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a> to 99/100 AD.

Ammianus relates (<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060211084122/http%3A//www.gmu.edu/departments/fld/CLASSICS/ammianus17.html">xvii.1.11</a>) that much later the Emperor <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian</a> undertook a <a href="punitive%20expedition">punitive expedition</a> against the Alemanni, who by then were in Alsace, and crossed the Main (Latin "Menus"), entering the forest, where the trails were blocked by felled trees. As winter was upon them, they reoccupied a
"fortification which was founded on the soil of the Alemanni that Trajan wished to be called with his own name".

In this context the use of Alemanni is possibly an anachronism but it reveals that Ammianus believed they were the same people, which is consistent with the location of the Alemanni of Caracalla's campaigns.

The early detailed source, the "<a href="Germania%20%28book%29">Germania</a>" of <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, has sometimes been interpreted in such a way as to provide yet other historical problems. In <a href="http%3A//www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01040.htm">Chapter 42</a> we read of the <a href="Hermunduri">Hermunduri</a>, a tribe certainly located in the region that later became <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>. Tacitus stated that they traded with <a href="Rhaetia">Rhaetia</a>, which in Ptolemy is located across the Danube from <a href="Germania%20Superior">Germania Superior</a>. A logical conclusion to draw is that the Hermunduri extended over later <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a> and therefore the Alemanni originally derived from the Hermunduri.

However, no Hermunduri appear in Ptolemy, though after the time of Ptolemy, the Hermunduri joined with the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> in the wars of 166–180 against the empire. A careful reading of Tacitus provides one solution. He says that the source of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> is among the Hermunduri, somewhat to the east of the upper <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a>. He places them also between the <a href="Naristi">Naristi</a> (Varisti), whose location at the very edge of the ancient <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> is well known, and the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> and <a href="Quadi">Quadi</a>. Moreover, the Hermunduri were broken in the <a href="Marcomannic%20Wars">Marcomannic Wars</a> and made a separate peace with Rome. The Alemanni thus were probably not primarily the Hermunduri, although some elements of them may have been present in the mix of peoples at that time that became Alemannian.

Before the mention of "Alemanni" in the time of Caracalla, you would search in vain for Alemanni in the moderately detailed geography of southern Germany in Claudius <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, written in Greek in the mid-2nd century; it is likely that at that time, the people who later used that name were known by other designations.

Nevertheless, some conclusions can be drawn from Ptolemy. Germania Superior is easily identified. Following up the Rhine one comes to a town, Mattiacum, which must be at the border of the Roman Germany (vicinity of <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>). Upstream from it and between the Rhine and <a href="Abnoba">Abnoba</a> (in the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>) are the <a href="Ingriones">Ingriones</a>, <a href="Intuergi">Intuergi</a>, <a href="Vangiones">Vangiones</a>, <a href="Caritni">Caritni</a> and <a href="Vispi">Vispi</a>, some of whom were there since the days of the early empire or before. On the other side of the northern Black Forest were the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a> about where <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a> is today, on the lower Main.

Historic Swabia was eventually replaced by today's <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, but it had been the most significant territory of mediaeval <a href="Alamannia">Alamannia</a>, comprising all Germania Superior and territory east to <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. It did not include the upper Main, but that is where Caracalla campaigned. Moreover, the territory of Germania Superior was not originally included among the Alemanni's possessions.

However, if we look for the peoples in the region from the upper Main in the north, south to the Danube and east to the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> where the <a href="Quadi">Quadi</a> and <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> were located, Ptolemy does not give any tribes. There are the <a href="Tubanti">Tubanti</a> just south of the <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a> and at the other end of what was then the Black Forest, the <a href="Varisti">Varisti</a>, whose location is known. One possible reason for this distribution is that the population preferred not to live in the forest except in troubled times. The region between the forest and the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> on the other hand included about a dozen settlements, or "cantons".

Ptolemy's view of Germans in the region indicates that the tribal structure had lost its grip in the Black Forest region and was replaced by a canton structure. The tribes stayed in the Roman province, perhaps because the Romans offered stability. Also, Caracalla perhaps felt more comfortable about campaigning in the upper Main because he was not declaring war on any specific historic tribe, such as the Chatti or <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a>, against whom Rome had suffered grievous losses. By Caracalla's time the name "Alemanni" was being used by cantons themselves banding together for purposes of supporting a citizen army (the "war bands").

The term Suebi has a double meaning in the sources. On the one hand Tacitus' "Germania" tells us (<a href="http%3A//www.sacred-texts.com/cla/tac/g01030.htm">Chapters 38, 39)</a> that they occupy more than half of Germany, use a distinctive hair style, and are spiritually centered on the <a href="Semnones">Semnones</a>. On the other hand, the Suebi of the upper Danube are described as though they were a tribe.

The solution to the puzzle as well as explaining the historical circumstances leading to the choice of the Agri Decumates as a defensive point and the concentration of Germans there are probably to be found in the German attack on the Gallic fortified town of <a href="Vesontio">Vesontio</a> in 58 BC. The upper Rhine and Danube appear to form a funnel pointing straight at Vesontio.

<a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> in "<a href="Gallic%20Wars">Gallic Wars</a>" tells us (<a href="http%3A//etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2%3Fid%3DCaeComm.sgm%26amp%3Bimages%3Dimages/modeng%26amp%3Bdata%3D/texts/english/modeng/parsed%26amp%3Btag%3Dpublic%26amp%3Bpart%3D1%26amp%3Bdivision%3Ddiv2">1.51</a>) that <a href="Ariovistus">Ariovistus</a> had gathered an army from a wide region of Germany, but especially the <a href="Harudes">Harudes</a>, <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a>, <a href="Triboci">Triboci</a>, <a href="Vangiones">Vangiones</a>, <a href="Nemetes">Nemetes</a> and <a href="Sedusii">Sedusii</a>. The Suebi were being invited to join. They lived in 100 cantons (<a href="http%3A//etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2%3Fid%3DCaeComm.sgm%26amp%3Bimages%3Dimages/modeng%26amp%3Bdata%3D/texts/english/modeng/parsed%26amp%3Btag%3Dpublic%26amp%3Bpart%3D4%26amp%3Bdivision%3Ddiv2">4.1</a>) from which 1000 young men per year were chosen for military service, a citizen-army by our standards and by comparison with the Roman professional army.

Ariovistus had become involved in an invasion of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>, which the German wished to settle. Intending to take the strategic town of Vesontio, he concentrated his forces on the Rhine near Lake Constance, and when the Suebi arrived, he crossed. The Gauls had called to Rome for military aid. Caesar occupied the town first and defeated the Germans before its walls, slaughtering most of the German army as it tried to flee across the river (1.36ff). He did not pursue the retreating remnants, leaving what was left of the German army and their dependents intact on the other side of the Rhine.

The Gauls were ambivalent in their policies toward the Romans. In 53 BC the <a href="Treveri">Treveri</a> broke their alliance and attempted to break free of Rome. Caesar foresaw that they would now attempt to ally themselves with the Germans. He crossed the Rhine to forestall that event, a successful strategy. Remembering their expensive defeat at the Battle of Vesontio, the Germans withdrew to the Black Forest, concentrating there a mixed population dominated by Suebi. As they had left their tribal homes behind, they probably took over all the former Celtic cantons along the Danube.
The Alemanni were continually engaged in conflicts with the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the 3rd and 4th centuries. They launched a major invasion of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> and northern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 268, when the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion of the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> from the east. Their raids throughout the three parts of Gaul were traumatic: <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a> (died ca 594) mentions their destructive force at the time of <a href="Valerian%20%28emperor%29">Valerian</a> and <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a> (253–260), when the Alemanni assembled under their "king", whom he calls <a href="Chrocus">Chrocus</a>, who "by the advice, it is said, of his wicked mother, and overran the whole of the Gauls, and destroyed from their foundations all the temples which had been built in ancient times. And coming to <a href="Clermont-Ferrand">Clermont</a> he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call "Vasso Galatae" in the Gallic tongue," martyring many Christians (<a href="http%3A//www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.html%23book3">"Historia Francorum" pageRank.Book I.32–34</a>). Thus 6th-century Gallo-Romans of Gregory's class, surrounded by the ruins of <a href="Roman%20temple">Roman temple</a>s and public buildings, attributed the destruction they saw to the plundering raids of the Alemanni.

In the early summer of 268, the <a href="Roman%20Emperors">Emperor</a> <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a> halted their advance into Italy, but then had to deal with the Goths. When the Gothic campaign ended in Roman victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Naissus">Battle of Naissus</a> in September, Gallienus' successor <a href="Claudius%20Gothicus">Claudius Gothicus</a> turned north to deal with the Alemanni, who were swarming over all Italy north of the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a>.

After efforts to secure a peaceful withdrawal failed, Claudius forced the Alemanni to battle at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Benacus">Battle of Lake Benacus</a> in November. The Alemanni were routed, forced back into Germany, and did not threaten Roman territory for many years afterwards.

Their most famous battle against Rome took place in <a href="Argentoratum">Argentoratum</a> (<a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>), in 357, where they were defeated by <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a>, later Emperor of Rome, and their king <a href="Chnodomarius">Chnodomarius</a> was taken prisoner to Rome.

On January 2, 366, the Alemanni yet again crossed the frozen <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> in large numbers, to invade the Gallic provinces, this time being defeated by Valentinian (see <a href="Battle%20of%20Solicinium">Battle of Solicinium</a>). In the great mixed invasion of 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the <a href="Rhine">Rhine river</a> a final time, conquering and then settling what is today <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> and a large part of the <a href="Swiss%20Plateau">Swiss Plateau</a>. The crossing is described in <a href="Wallace%20Breem">Wallace Breem</a>'s historical novel "Eagle in the Snow." The <a href="Chronicle%20of%20Fredegar">Chronicle of Fredegar</a> gives the account. At "Alba Augusta" (<a href="Alba-la-Romaine">Alba-la-Romaine</a>) the devastation was so complete, that the Christian bishop retired to <a href="Viviers%2C%20Ard%C3%A8che">Viviers</a>, but in Gregory's account at Mende in <a href="Loz%C3%A8re">Lozère</a>, also deep in the heart of Gaul, bishop Privatus was forced to sacrifice to idols in the very cave where he was later venerated. It is thought this detail may be a generic literary ploy to epitomize the horrors of barbarian violence.


The kingdom of Alamannia between Strasbourg and Augsburg lasted until 496, when the Alemanni were conquered by <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tolbiac">Battle of Tolbiac</a>. The war of Clovis with the Alemanni forms the setting for the conversion of Clovis, briefly treated by <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>. (<a href="http%3A//www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/gregory-clovisconv.html%23n30">pageRank.Book II.31</a>) Subsequently, the Alemanni formed part of the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> dominions and were governed by a Frankish duke.

In 746, <a href="Carloman%20%28mayor%20of%20the%20palace%29">Carloman</a> ended an uprising by summarily executing all Alemannic nobility at the <a href="blood%20court%20at%20Cannstatt">blood court at Cannstatt</a>, and for the following century, Alemannia was ruled by Frankish dukes. Following the <a href="treaty%20of%20Verdun">treaty of Verdun</a> of 843, Alemannia became a province of the eastern kingdom of <a href="Louis%20the%20German">Louis the German</a>, the precursor of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The duchy persisted until 1268.

The German spoken today over the range of the former Alemanni is termed <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic German</a>, and is recognised among the subgroups of the <a href="High%20German%20languages">High German languages</a>. Alemannic runic inscriptions such as those on the <a href="Pforzen%20buckle">Pforzen buckle</a> are among the earliest testimonies of <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a>.
The <a href="High%20German%20consonant%20shift">High German consonant shift</a> is thought to have originated around the 5th century either in Alemannia or among the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a>; before that the dialect spoken by Alemannic tribes was little different from that of other West Germanic peoples.

"Alemannia" lost its distinct jurisdictional identity when <a href="Charles%20Martel">Charles Martel</a> absorbed it into the Frankish empire, early in the 8th century. Today, "Alemannic" is a linguistic term, referring to <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic German</a>, encompassing the dialects of the southern two thirds of <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a> (German State), in western <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> (German State), in <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a> (Austrian State), <a href="Swiss%20German">Swiss German</a> in Switzerland and the <a href="Alsatian%20language">Alsatian language</a> of the <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> (France).

The Alemanni established a series of territorially defined "pagi" (cantons) on the east bank of the Rhine. The exact number and extent of these "pagi" is unclear and probably changed over time.

"Pagi", usually pairs of "pagi" combined, formed kingdoms ("regna") which, it is generally believed, were permanent and hereditary. Ammianus describes Alemanni rulers with various terms: "reges excelsiores ante alios" ("paramount kings"), "reges proximi" ("neighbouring kings"), "reguli" ("petty kings") and "regales" ("princes"). This may be a formal hierarchy, or they may be vague, overlapping terms, or a combination of both. In 357, there appear to have been two paramount kings (Chnodomar and Westralp) who probably acted as presidents of the confederation and seven other kings ("reges"). Their territories were small and mostly strung along the Rhine (although a few were in the hinterland). It is possible that the "reguli" were the rulers of the two "pagi" in each kingdom. Underneath the royal class were the nobles (called "optimates" by the Romans) and warriors (called "armati" by the Romans). The warriors consisted of professional warbands and levies of free men. Each nobleman could raise an average of c. 50 warriors.

The <a href="Christianization">Christianization</a> of the Alemanni took place during <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> times (6th to 8th centuries). We know that in the 6th century, the Alemanni were predominantly pagan, and in the 8th century, they were predominantly Christian. The intervening 7th century was a period of genuine <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> during which Christian symbolism and doctrine gradually grew in influence.

Some scholars have speculated that members of the Alemannic elite such as king <a href="Gibuld">Gibuld</a> due to <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom">Visigothic</a> influence may have been converted to <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a> even in the later 5th century.

In the mid-6th century, the Byzantine historian <a href="Agathias">Agathias</a> records, in the context of the wars of the Goths and Franks against Byzantium, that the Alemanni fighting among the troops of Frankish king <a href="Theudebald">Theudebald</a> were like the Franks in all respects except religion, since
He also spoke of the particular ruthlessness of the Alemanni in destroying Christian sanctuaries and plundering churches while the genuine Franks were respectful towards those sanctuaries. Agathias expresses his hope that the Alemanni would assume better manners through prolonged contact with the Franks, which is by all appearances, in a manner of speaking, what eventually happened.

Apostles of the Alemanni were <a href="Columbanus">Columbanus</a> and his disciple <a href="Saint%20Gall">Saint Gall</a>. <a href="Jonas%20of%20Bobbio">Jonas of Bobbio</a> records that Columbanus was active in <a href="Bregenz">Bregenz</a>, where he disrupted a beer sacrifice to <a href="Wodan">Wodan</a>. Despite these activities, for some time, the Alemanni seem to have continued their pagan cult activities, with only superficial or <a href="Syncretism">syncretistic</a> Christian elements. In particular, there is no change in burial practice, and tumulus warrior graves continued to be erected throughout Merovingian times. Syncretism of traditional Germanic animal-style with Christian symbolism is also present in artwork, but Christian symbolism becomes more and more prevalent during the 7th century. Unlike the later Christianization of the Saxons and of the Slavs, the Alemanni seem to have adopted Christianity gradually, and voluntarily, spread in emulation of the Merovingian elite.

From c. the 520s to the 620s, there was a surge of <a href="Alemannic%20Elder%20Futhark%20inscriptions">Alemannic Elder Futhark inscriptions</a>. About 70 specimens have survived, roughly half of them on <a href="fibula%20%28brooch%29">fibulae</a>, others on belt buckles (see <a href="Pforzen%20buckle">Pforzen buckle</a>, <a href="B%C3%BClach%20fibula">Bülach fibula</a>) and other jewelry and weapon parts. Use of runes subsides with the advance of Christianity.
The <a href="Nordendorf%20fibula">Nordendorf fibula</a> (early 7th century) clearly records pagan theonyms, "logaþorewodanwigiþonar " read as "Wodan and Donar are magicians/sorcerers", but this may be interpreted as either a pagan invocation of the powers of these deities, or a Christian protective charm against them.
A runic inscription on a fibula found at <a href="Bad%20Ems">Bad Ems</a> reflects Christian pious sentiment (and is also explicitly marked with a Christian cross), reading "god fura dih deofile ᛭" ("God for/before you, Theophilus!", or alternatively "God before you, Devil!"). Dated to between AD 660 and 690, it marks the end of the native Alemannic tradition of runic literacy. Bad Ems is in <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>, on the northwestern boundary of Alemannic settlement, where Frankish influence would have been strongest.

The establishment of the bishopric of <a href="Konstanz">Konstanz</a> cannot be dated exactly and was possibly undertaken by Columbanus himself (before 612). In any case, it existed by 635, when <a href="Gunzo">Gunzo</a> appointed <a href="John%20of%20Grab">John of Grab</a> bishop. Constance was a missionary bishopric in newly converted lands, and did not look back on late Roman church history (unlike the Raetian bishopric of <a href="Chur">Chur</a>, established 451) and <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, which was an episcopal seat from 740, and which continued the line of Bishops of <a href="Augusta%20Raurica">Augusta Raurica</a> (see <a href="Bishop%20of%20Basel">Bishop of Basel</a>). The establishment of the church as an institution recognized by worldly rulers is also visible in legal history. In the early 7th century "<a href="Pactus%20Alamannorum">Pactus Alamannorum</a>" hardly ever mentions the special privileges of the church, while <a href="Lantfrid">Lantfrid</a>'s "<a href="Lex%20Alamannorum">Lex Alamannorum</a>" of 720 has an entire chapter reserved for ecclesial matters alone.

NYSE American

NYSE American, formerly known as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and more recently as NYSE MKT, is an American <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a> situated in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. AMEX was previously a <a href="mutual%20organization">mutual organization</a>, owned by its members. Until 1953, it was known as the New York Curb Exchange.

<a href="NYSE%20Euronext">NYSE Euronext</a> acquired AMEX on October 1, 2008, with AMEX integrated with the <a href="Alternext">Alternext</a> European <a href="Market%20capitalization%23Market%20cap%20terms">small-cap</a> exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S. In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.

Following the <a href="U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">SEC</a> approval of competing stock exchange <a href="IEX">IEX</a> in 2016, NYSE MKT <a href="rebranded">rebranded</a> as NYSE American and introduced a 350-microsecond delay in trading, referred to as a "speed bump", which is also present on the IEX.

The exchange grew out of the loosely organized <a href="curb%20market">curb market</a> of <a href="curbstone%20broker">curbstone broker</a>s on <a href="Broad%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Broad Street</a> in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under <a href="Emanuel%20S.%20Mendels">Emanuel S. Mendels</a> and <a href="Carl%20H.%20Pforzheimer">Carl H. Pforzheimer</a>. The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the <a href="Blair%20Building">Blair Building</a> where cabbies lined up. There they were given a "little domain of asphalt" fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street. As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10'clock in the morning, each day except <a href="Sundays">Sundays</a>, until a gong at 3 o'clock. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage. 

As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules "by right of seniority", but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the "Times", this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships. However, in 1908 the New York Curb Market Agency was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels. The informal Curb Association formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables. The curb exchange was for years at odds with the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> (NYSE), or "Big Board", operating several buildings away. Explained the "New York Times" in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as "a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'" On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks "made homeless by the abolition" were "refused domicile" by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the "Curb list" of requirements. In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the New York Curb Market Association, which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.

In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a roaring, swirling whirlpool” that "tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, then pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.” After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, <a href="Starrett%20%26amp%3B%20Van%20Vleck">Starrett & Van Vleck</a> designed the <a href="American%20Stock%20Exchange%20Building">new exchange building</a> on <a href="Greenwich%20Street">Greenwich Street</a> in <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a> between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921, and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921. In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined.

<a href="George%20Rea">George Rea</a> was approached about the position of president of the New York Curb Exchange in 1939. He was unanimously elected as the first paid president in the history of the Curb Exchange. He was paid $25,000 per year and held the position for 3 years before offering his resignation in 1942. He left the position having "done such a good job that there is virtually no need for a full-time successor."

In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange. The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization. Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the <a href="American%20Stock%20Exchange">American Stock Exchange</a> named <a href="Edwin%20Etherington">Edwin Etherington</a> its president. Writes <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, he and executive vice president <a href="Paul%20Kolton">Paul Kolton</a> were "tapped in 1962 to clean up and reinvigorate the scandal-plagued American Stock Exchange." At AMEX for five years, he was credited with improving opportunities for minorities and women. In 1971, <a href="Johnson%20Products%20Company">Johnson Products Company</a> became the first African American-owned company to be listed on the <a href="American%20Stock%20Exchange">American Stock Exchange</a>.

As of 1971, it was the second largest stock exchange in the United States. Paul Kolton succeeded Ralph S. Saul as AMEX president on June 17, 1971, making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971. In November 1972, Kolton was named as the exchange's first chief executive officer and its first salaried top executive. As chairman, Kolton oversaw the introduction of <a href="options%20trading">options trading</a>. Kolton opposed the idea of a merger with the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> while he headed the exchange saying that "two independent, viable exchanges are much more likely to be responsive to new pressures and public needs than a single institution". Kolton announced in July 1977 that he would be leaving his position at the American Exchange in November of that year.

In 1977, <a href="Thomas%20Peterffy">Thomas Peterffy</a> purchased a seat on the <a href="American%20Stock%20Exchange">American Stock Exchange</a> and played a role in developing the <a href="electronic%20trading">electronic trading</a> of <a href="Security%20%28finance%29">securities</a>. Peterffy created a major stir among traders by introducing handheld computers onto the trading floor in the early 1980s.

<a href="Richard%20F.%20Syron">Richard F. Syron</a> joined the American Stock Exchange as CEO in 1994 held that post for five years, which included its merger in 1998 into the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Securities%20Dealers">National Association of Securities Dealers</a>.

As of 2003, AMEX was the only U.S. stock market to permit the transmission of buy and sell orders through <a href="Hand%20signaling%20%28open%20outcry%29">hand signals</a>.

In October 2008 <a href="NYSE%20Euronext">NYSE Euronext</a> completed acquisition of the AMEX for $260 million in stock. Before the closing of the acquisition, NYSE Euronext announced that the AMEX would be integrated with the <a href="Alternext">Alternext</a> European <a href="Market%20capitalization%23Market%20cap%20terms">small-cap</a> exchange and renamed the NYSE Alternext U.S. The American Stock Exchange merged with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) on October 1, 2008. Post merger, the Amex equities business was branded "NYSE Alternext US". As part of the re-branding exercise, NYSE Alternext US was re-branded as NYSE Amex Equities. On December 1, 2008, the Curb Exchange building at 86 Trinity Place was closed, and the Amex Equities trading floor was moved to the NYSE Trading floor at 11 <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>. 90 years after its 1921 opening, the old New York Curb Market building was empty but remained standing. In March 2009, NYSE Alternext U.S. was changed to NYSE Amex Equities. On May 10, 2012, NYSE Amex Equities changed its name to NYSE MKT LLC.

In June 2016, a competing stock exchange <a href="IEX">IEX</a> (which operated with a 350-microsecond delay in trading), gained approval from the <a href="U.S.%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">SEC</a>, despite lobbying protests by the NYSE and other exchanges and trading firms. Subsequently the NYSE renamed NYSE MKT to NYSE American, and announced plans to introduce its own 350-microsecond "speed bump" in trading on the small and mid-cap company exchange.

Alfred Russel Wallace

Alfred Russel Wallace (8 January 1823 – 7 November 1913) was a British <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a>, explorer, geographer, anthropologist, and biologist. He is best known for independently conceiving the theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> through <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s writings in 1858. This prompted Darwin to publish his own ideas in "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>." Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the <a href="Amazon%20River%20basin">Amazon River basin</a> and then in the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a>, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the <a href="Wallace%20Line">Wallace Line</a>, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>.

He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the "father of <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>". Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made many other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of <a href="Aposematism">warning colouration</a> in animals, and the <a href="Wallace%20effect">Wallace effect</a>, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to <a href="speciation">speciation</a> by encouraging the development of barriers against <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a>.

Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution). His advocacy of <a href="Spiritualism%20%28religious%20movement%29">spiritualism</a> and his belief in a <a href="Dualism%20%28philosophy%20of%20mind%29">non-material origin</a> for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with some members of the scientific establishment.

Aside from scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>", was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.

Wallace had financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His Amazon and Far Eastern trips were supported by the sale of specimens he collected and, after he lost most of the considerable money he made from those sales in unsuccessful investments, he had to support himself mostly from the publications he produced. Unlike some of his contemporaries in the British scientific community, such as Darwin and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, he had no family wealth to fall back on, and he was unsuccessful in finding a long-term salaried position, receiving no regular income until he was awarded a small government pension, through Darwin's efforts, in 1881.

Alfred Wallace was born in the Welsh village of <a href="Llanbadoc">Llanbadoc</a>, near <a href="Usk">Usk</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>. He was the seventh of nine children of Thomas Vere Wallace and Mary Anne Greenell. Mary Anne was English; Thomas Wallace was probably of Scottish ancestry. His family, like many Wallaces, claimed a connection to <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>, a leader of Scottish forces during the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a> in the 13th century. Thomas Wallace graduated in law, but never practised law. He owned some income-generating property, but bad investments and failed business ventures resulted in a steady deterioration of the family's financial position. His mother was from a middle-class English family from <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a>, north of London. When Wallace was five years old, his family moved to Hertford. There he attended <a href="Richard%20Hale%20School">Hertford Grammar School</a> until financial difficulties forced his family to withdraw him in 1836, when he was aged 14.
Wallace then moved to London to board with his older brother John, a 19-year-old apprentice builder. This was a stopgap measure until William, his oldest brother, was ready to take him on as an apprentice <a href="surveying">surveyor</a>. While in London, Alfred attended lectures and read books at the <a href="London%20Mechanics%20Institute">London Mechanics Institute</a>. Here he was exposed to the radical political ideas of the Welsh social reformer <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a> and of <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>. He left London in 1837 to live with William and work as his apprentice for six years.

At the end of 1839, they moved to <a href="Kington%2C%20Herefordshire">Kington</a>, Hereford, near the Welsh border, before eventually settling at <a href="Neath">Neath</a> in <a href="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a> in Wales. Between 1840 and 1843, Wallace did land surveying work in the countryside of the west of England and Wales. By the end of 1843, William's business had declined due to difficult economic conditions, and Wallace, at the age of 20, left in January.

One result of Wallace's early travels is a modern controversy about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned this because neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore that he was an Englishman born in Wales.

After a brief period of unemployment, he was hired as a master at the Collegiate School in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read "<a href="An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Principle%20of%20Population">An Essay on the Principle of Population</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>, and one evening he met the entomologist <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a>. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal "Zoologist". He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the <a href="River%20Neath">Vale of Neath</a>.

Wallace's work on the survey involved spending a lot of time outdoors in the countryside, allowing him to indulge his new passion for collecting insects. Wallace persuaded his brother John to join him in starting another architecture and civil engineering firm, which carried out a number of projects, including the design of a building for the Neath <a href="Mechanics%27%20Institute">Mechanics' Institute</a>, founded in 1843. William Jevons, the founder of that institute, was impressed by Wallace and persuaded him to give lectures there on science and engineering. In the autumn of 1846, John and he purchased a cottage near Neath, where they lived with their mother and sister Fanny (his father had died in 1843).

During this period, he read avidly, exchanging letters with Bates about <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>' anonymously published evolutionary treatise "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>", Charles Darwin's "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Beagle">The Voyage of the Beagle</a>", and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>'s "<a href="Principles%20of%20Geology">Principles of Geology</a>".

Inspired by the chronicles of earlier travelling naturalists, including <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, Charles Darwin and especially <a href="William%20Henry%20Edwards">William Henry Edwards</a>, Wallace decided that he too wanted to travel abroad as a naturalist. In 1848, Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil aboard the "Mischief". Their intention was to collect insects and other animal specimens in the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon Rainforest</a> for their private collections, selling the duplicates to museums and collectors back in Britain in order to fund the trip. Wallace also hoped to gather evidence of the <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>.

Wallace and Bates spent most of their first year collecting near <a href="Bel%C3%A9m%20do%20Par%C3%A1">Belém do Pará</a>, then explored inland separately, occasionally meeting to discuss their findings. In 1849, they were briefly joined by another young explorer, botanist <a href="Richard%20Spruce">Richard Spruce</a>, along with Wallace's younger brother Herbert. Herbert left soon thereafter (dying two years later from <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>), but Spruce, like Bates, would spend over ten years collecting in South America.

Wallace continued charting the <a href="Rio%20Negro%20%28Amazon%29">Rio Negro</a> for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples and languages he encountered as well as the geography, flora, and fauna. On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for the UK on the brig "Helen". After 26 days at sea, the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, mostly collected during the last two, and most interesting, years of his trip, were lost. He managed to save a few notes and pencil sketches and little else.

Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig "Jordeson", which was sailing from Cuba to London. The "Jordeson"'s provisions were strained by the unexpected passengers, but after a difficult passage on very short rations the ship finally reached its destination on 1 October 1852.

After his return to the UK, Wallace spent 18 months in London living on the insurance payment for his lost collection and selling a few specimens that had been shipped back to Britain prior to his starting his exploration of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20%28Argentina%29">Rio Negro</a> until the indian town of <a href="Jativa">Jativa</a> on <a href="Orinoco%20River">Orinoco River</a> basin and as far west as Micúru (Mitú) on the <a href="Uaup%C3%A9s%20River">Uaupés River</a>. He was deeply impressed by the grandeur of the virgin forest, by the variety and beauty of the butterflies and birds, and by his first encounter with Indians on the Uaupés River area, an experience he never forgot. During this period, despite having lost almost all of the notes from his South American expedition, he wrote six academic papers (which included "On the Monkeys of the Amazon") and two books; "Palm Trees of the Amazon and Their Uses" and "Travels on the Amazon". He also made connections with a number of other British naturalists—most significantly, Darwin.

From 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the Malay Archipelago or <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study natural history. A set of 80 bird skeletons he collected in Indonesia and associated documentation can be found in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Museum%20of%20Zoology">Cambridge University Museum of Zoology</a>. His observations of the marked zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the <a href="Wallace%20line">Wallace line</a>.

Wallace collected more than 126,000 specimens in the Malay Archipelago (more than 80,000 beetles alone). Several thousand of them represented species new to science. One of his better-known species descriptions during this trip is that of the gliding tree frog "<a href="Rhacophorus%20nigropalmatus">Rhacophorus nigropalmatus</a>", known as Wallace's <a href="flying%20frog">flying frog</a>. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.

Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>", which became one of the most popular books of scientific exploration of the 19th century, and has never been out of print. It was praised by scientists such as Darwin (to whom the book was dedicated), and Charles Lyell, and by non-scientists such as the novelist <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>, who called it his "favorite bedside companion" and used it as source of information for several of his novels, especially "<a href="Lord%20Jim">Lord Jim</a>".

In 1862, Wallace returned to England, where he moved in with his sister Fanny Sims and her husband Thomas. While recovering from his travels, Wallace organised his collections and gave numerous lectures about his adventures and discoveries to scientific societies such as the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society of London</a>. Later that year, he visited Darwin at <a href="Down%20House">Down House</a>, and became friendly with both Charles Lyell and <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>. During the 1860s, Wallace wrote papers and gave lectures defending natural selection. He also corresponded with Darwin about a variety of topics, including <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>, <a href="warning%20colouration">warning colouration</a>, and the possible effect of natural selection on hybridisation and the divergence of species. In 1865, he began investigating spiritualism.

After a year of courtship, Wallace became engaged in 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only identify as Miss L. Miss L. was the daughter of Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement. In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was also a good friend of Annie Mitten's father, <a href="William%20Mitten">William Mitten</a>, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built <a href="The%20Dell%20%28Thurrock%29">the Dell</a>, a house of concrete, on land he leased in <a href="Grays">Grays</a> in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874), Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).

In the late 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very concerned about the financial security of his family. While he was in the Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of "<a href="The%20Malay%20Archipelago">The Malay Archipelago</a>".

Despite assistance from his friends, he was never able to secure a permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit some of their own works.

In 1876, Wallace needed a £500 advance from the publisher of "The Geographical Distribution of Animals" to avoid having to sell some of his personal property. Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.

<a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> was impressed by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in "The Malay Archipelago". Mill asked him to join the general committee of his <a href="Land%20Tenure%20Reform%20Association">Land Tenure Reform Association</a>, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written only a handful of articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.

In 1881, Wallace was elected as the first president of the newly formed Land Nationalisation Society. In the next year, he published a book, "Land Nationalisation; Its Necessity and Its Aims", on the subject. He criticised the UK's <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> policies for the negative impact they had on working-class people. In 1889, Wallace read "<a href="Looking%20Backward">Looking Backward</a>" by <a href="Edward%20Bellamy">Edward Bellamy</a> and declared himself a socialist, despite his earlier foray as a speculative investor. After reading "<a href="Progress%20and%20Poverty">Progress and Poverty</a>", the best selling book by the progressive land reformist <a href="Henry%20George">Henry George</a>, Wallace described it as "Undoubtedly the most remarkable and important book of the present century."

Wallace opposed <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, an idea supported by other prominent 19th-century evolutionary thinkers, on the grounds that contemporary society was too corrupt and unjust to allow any reasonable determination of who was fit or unfit. In the 1890 article "Human Selection" he wrote, "Those who succeed in the race for wealth are by no means the best or the most intelligent ...". In 1898, Wallace wrote a paper advocating a <a href="Fiat%20currency">pure paper money system, not backed by silver or gold</a>, which impressed the economist <a href="Irving%20Fisher">Irving Fisher</a> so much that he dedicated his 1920 book "Stabilizing the Dollar" to Wallace.

Wallace wrote on other social and political topics including his support for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of <a href="militarism">militarism</a>. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and that the results of war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the <a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a> in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea "...that this new horror is "inevitable," and that all we can do is to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships."

In 1898, Wallace published a book entitled "The Wonderful Century: Its Successes and Its Failures" about developments in the 19th century. The first part of the book covered the major scientific and technical advances of the century; the second part covered what Wallace considered to be its social failures including: the destruction and waste of wars and arms races, the rise of the urban poor and the dangerous conditions in which they lived and worked, a harsh criminal justice system that failed to reform criminals, abuses in a mental health system based on privately owned sanatoriums, the environmental damage caused by capitalism, and the evils of European colonialism. Wallace continued his social activism for the rest of his life, publishing the book "The Revolt of Democracy" just weeks before his death.

Wallace continued his scientific work in parallel with his social commentary. In 1880, he published "Island Life" as a sequel to "The Geographic Distribution of Animals". In November 1886, Wallace began a ten-month trip to the United States to give a series of popular lectures. Most of the lectures were on Darwinism (evolution through natural selection), but he also gave speeches on <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>, spiritualism, and socio-economic reform. During the trip, he was reunited with his brother John who had emigrated to California years before. He also spent a week in Colorado, with the American botanist <a href="Alice%20Eastwood">Alice Eastwood</a> as his guide, exploring the flora of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and gathering evidence that would lead him to a theory on how <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> might explain certain commonalities between the mountain flora of Europe, Asia and North America, which he published in 1891 in the paper "English and American Flowers". He met many other prominent American naturalists and viewed their collections. His 1889 book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>" used information he collected on his American trip, and information he had compiled for the lectures.

On 7 November 1913, Wallace died at home in the country house he called Old Orchard, which he had built a decade earlier. He was 90 years old. His death was widely reported in the press. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called him "the last of the giants belonging to that wonderful group of intellectuals that included, among others, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer, Lyell, and Owen, whose daring investigations revolutionised and evolutionised the thought of the century." Another commentator in the same edition said "No apology need be made for the few literary or scientific follies of the author of that great book on the 'Malay Archipelago'."

Some of Wallace's friends suggested that he be buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at <a href="Broadstone%2C%20Dorset">Broadstone, Dorset</a>. Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin had been buried. The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.

Unlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in the <a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutation of species</a>. The concept had been advocated by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a>, <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Edmond%20Grant">Robert Grant</a>, among others. It was widely discussed, but not generally accepted by leading naturalists, and was considered to have <a href="radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a>, even revolutionary connotations.

Prominent anatomists and geologists such as <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, <a href="Adam%20Sedgwick">Adam Sedgwick</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> attacked it vigorously. It has been suggested that Wallace accepted the idea of the transmutation of species in part because he was always inclined to favour radical ideas in politics, religion and science, and because he was unusually open to marginal, even fringe, ideas in science.

He was also profoundly influenced by <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>' work, "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20the%20Natural%20History%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</a>", a highly controversial work of popular science published anonymously in 1844 that advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. Wallace wrote to Henry Bates in 1845:

I have a rather more favourable opinion of the 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.

In 1847, he wrote to Bates:
I should like to take some one family [of beetles] to study thoroughly, principally with a view to the theory of the origin of species. By that means I am strongly of opinion that some definite results might be arrived at.

Wallace deliberately planned some of his field work to test the hypothesis that under an evolutionary scenario closely related species should inhabit neighbouring territories. During his work in the Amazon basin, he came to realise that geographical barriers—such as the Amazon and its major tributaries—often separated the ranges of closely allied species, and he included these observations in his 1853 paper "On the Monkeys of the Amazon". Near the end of the paper he asks the question, "Are very closely allied species ever separated by a wide interval of country?"

In February 1855, while working in <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a> on the island of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, Wallace wrote "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", a paper which was published in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Natural%20History">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</a>" in September 1855. In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>. His conclusion that "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species" has come to be known as the "Sarawak Law". Wallace thus answered the question he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.

The paper shook Charles Lyell's belief that species were immutable. Although his friend Charles Darwin had written to him in 1842 expressing support for transmutation, Lyell had continued to be strongly opposed to the idea. Around the start of 1856, he told Darwin about Wallace's paper, as did <a href="Edward%20Blyth">Edward Blyth</a> who thought it "Good! Upon the whole! ... Wallace has, I think put the matter well; and according to his theory the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into "species"." Despite this hint, Darwin mistook Wallace's conclusion for the <a href="progressive%20creationism">progressive creationism</a> of the time and wrote that it was "nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree [but] it seems all creation with him." Lyell was more impressed, and opened a notebook on species, in which he grappled with the consequences, particularly for human ancestry. Darwin had already shown his theory to their mutual friend <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> and now, for the first time, he spelt out the full details of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to Lyell. Although Lyell could not agree, he urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. Darwin demurred at first, then began writing up a "species sketch" of his continuing work in May 1856.

By February 1858, Wallace had been convinced by his biogeographical research in the Malay Archipelago of the reality of evolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:

The problem then was not only how and why do species change, but how and why do they change into new and well defined species, distinguished from each other in so many ways; why and how they become so exactly adapted to distinct modes of life; and why do all the intermediate grades die out (as geology shows they have died out) and leave only clearly defined and well marked species, genera, and higher groups of animals?

According to his autobiography, it was while he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>'s idea of positive checks on human population growth and came up with the idea of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. Wallace said in his autobiography that he was on the island of <a href="Ternate">Ternate</a> at the time; but historians have questioned this, saying that on the basis of the journal he kept at the time, he was on the island of <a href="Halmahera">Gilolo</a>. From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman <a href="Maarten%20Dirk%20van%20Renesse%20van%20Duivenbode">Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode</a>. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.

Wallace describes how he discovered natural selection as follows:

"It then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species, since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year, as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask the question, why do some die and some live? And the answer was clearly, on the whole the best fitted live ... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist, then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about ... In this way every part of an animals organization could be modified exactly as required, and in the very process of this modification the unmodified would die out, and thus the definite characters and the clear isolation of each new species would be explained."

Wallace had once briefly met Darwin, and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper "On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species" of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that "without speculation there is no good and original observation" while commenting that "I believe I go much further than you". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, "<a href="On%20the%20Tendency%20of%20Species%20to%20form%20Varieties%3B%20and%20on%20the%20Perpetuation%20of%20Varieties%20and%20Species%20by%20Natural%20Means%20of%20Selection">On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type</a>", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> if he thought it worthwhile. Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term "natural selection", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying "he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal." Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnean Society of London</a> on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to <a href="Asa%20Gray">Asa Gray</a> in 1857.

Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was impossible without months of delay, so he was not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the highest levels of the scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.

Over the years, a few people have questioned this version of events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only that there had been a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.

After the publication of Darwin's "On the Origin of Species", Wallace became one of its staunchest defenders on his return to England in 1862. In one incident in 1863 that particularly pleased Darwin, Wallace published the short paper "Remarks on the Rev. S. Haughton's Paper on the Bee's Cell, And on the Origin of Species" in order to rebut a paper by a professor of geology at the University of Dublin that had sharply criticised Darwin's comments in the "Origin" on how hexagonal honey bee cells could have evolved through natural selection.

An even lengthier defence of Darwin's work was "Creation by Law", a review Wallace wrote in 1867 for "<a href="The%20Quarterly%20Journal%20of%20Science">The Quarterly Journal of Science</a>" of the book "The Reign of Law", which had been written by <a href="George%20Campbell%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">George Campbell</a>, the 8th Duke of Argyll, as a refutation of natural selection. After an 1870 meeting of the <a href="British%20Association">British Association</a>, Wallace wrote to Darwin complaining that there were "no opponents left who know anything of natural history, so that there are none of the good discussions we used to have."

Historians of science have noted that, while Darwin considered the ideas in Wallace's paper to be essentially the same as his own, there were differences. Darwin emphasised competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace emphasised environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably <a href="Peter%20J.%20Bowler">Peter J. Bowler</a>, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather <a href="group%20selection">group selection</a>. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.

Others have noted that another difference was that Wallace appeared to have envisioned natural selection as a kind of feedback mechanism keeping species and varieties adapted to their environment. They point to a largely overlooked passage of Wallace's famous 1858 paper:

The action of this principle is exactly like that of the <a href="centrifugal%20governor">centrifugal governor</a> of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.

The <a href="cybernetics">cybernetician</a> and anthropologist <a href="Gregory%20Bateson">Gregory Bateson</a> would observe in the 1970s that, though writing it only as an example, Wallace had "probably said the most powerful thing that'd been said in the 19th Century". Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book "Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity", and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and <a href="systems%20theory">systems theory</a>.

In 1867, Darwin wrote to Wallace about a problem he was having understanding how some caterpillars could have evolved conspicuous colour schemes. Darwin had come to believe that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>, an agency to which Wallace did not attribute the same importance as Darwin did, explained many conspicuous animal colour schemes. However, Darwin realised that this could not apply to caterpillars. Wallace responded that he and <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a> had observed that many of the most spectacular butterflies had a peculiar odour and taste, and that he had been told by <a href="John%20Jenner%20Weir">John Jenner Weir</a> that birds would not eat a certain kind of common white moth because they found it unpalatable. "Now, as the white moth is as conspicuous at dusk as a coloured caterpillar in the daylight", Wallace wrote back to Darwin that it seemed likely that the conspicuous colour scheme served as a warning to predators and thus could have evolved through natural selection. Darwin was impressed by the idea. At a subsequent meeting of the Entomological Society, Wallace asked for any evidence anyone might have on the topic. In 1869, Weir published data from experiments and observations involving brightly coloured caterpillars that supported Wallace's idea. <a href="Aposematism">Warning coloration</a> was one of a number of contributions Wallace made in the area of the evolution of <a href="Colours%20of%20animals">animal coloration</a> in general and the concept of protective coloration in particular. It was also part of a lifelong disagreement Wallace had with Darwin over the importance of sexual selection. In his 1878 book "Tropical Nature and Other Essays", he wrote extensively on the coloration of animals and plants and proposed alternative explanations for a number of cases Darwin had attributed to sexual selection. He revisited the topic at length in his 1889 book "Darwinism". In 1890, he wrote a critical review in "<a href="Nature%20%28magazine%29">Nature</a>" of his friend <a href="Edward%20Bagnall%20Poulton">Edward Bagnall Poulton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Colours%20of%20Animals">The Colours of Animals</a>" which supported Darwin on sexual selection, attacking especially Poulton's claims on the "aesthetic preferences of the insect world".

In 1889, Wallace wrote the book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>", which explained and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might contribute to the development of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the <a href="Wallace%20effect">Wallace effect</a>, later referred to as <a href="Reinforcement%20%28speciation%29">reinforcement</a>. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.

In 1864, Wallace published a paper, "The Origin of Human Races and the Antiquity of Man Deduced from the Theory of 'Natural Selection'", applying the theory to humankind. Darwin had not yet publicly addressed the subject, although <a href="Thomas%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> had in "<a href="Evidence%20as%20to%20Man%27s%20Place%20in%20Nature">Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature</a>". He explained the apparent stability of the human stock by pointing to the vast gap in cranial capacities between humans and the great apes. Unlike some other Darwinists, including Darwin himself, he did not "regard modern primitives as almost filling the gap between man and ape". He saw the evolution of humans in two stages: achieving a bipedal posture freeing the hands to carry out the dictates of the brain, and the "recognition of the human brain as a totally new factor in the history of life. Wallace was apparently the first evolutionist to recognize clearly that ... with the emergence of that bodily specialization which constitutes the human brain, bodily specialization itself might be said to be outmoded." For this paper he won Darwin's praise.

Shortly afterwards, Wallace became a <a href="spiritualism">spiritualist</a>. At about the same time, he began to maintain that natural selection cannot account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, and wit and humour. He eventually said that something in "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in humankind. He also believed that the <a href="wikt%3Araison%20d%27%C3%AAtre">raison d'être</a> of the universe was the development of the human spirit. These views greatly disturbed Darwin, who argued that spiritual appeals were not necessary and that <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> could easily explain apparently non-adaptive mental phenomena. While some historians have concluded that Wallace's belief that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of consciousness and the human mind was directly caused by his adoption of spiritualism, other Wallace scholars have disagreed, and some maintain that Wallace never believed natural selection applied to those areas. Reaction to Wallace's ideas on this topic among leading naturalists at the time varied. Charles Lyell endorsed Wallace's views on human evolution rather than Darwin's. Wallace's belief that human consciousness could not be entirely a product of purely material causes was shared by a number of prominent intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, many, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were critical of Wallace. As the historian of science <a href="Michael%20Shermer">Michael Shermer</a> has stated, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of the emerging Darwinian philosophy, which were that evolution was not <a href="teleological">teleological</a> (purpose driven) and that it was not <a href="anthropocentric">anthropocentric</a> (human-centred). Much later in his life Wallace returned to these themes, that evolution suggested that the universe might have a purpose and that certain aspects of living organisms might not be explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled "The World of Life", which he later expanded into a book of the same name; a work that Shermer said anticipated some ideas about design in nature and directed evolution that would arise from various religious traditions throughout the 20th century.

In many accounts of the development of evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science has pointed out that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's "<a href="Descent%20of%20Man">Descent of Man</a>", occasionally in strong disagreement.. 

Both Darwin and Wallace agreed on the importance of natural selection, and some of the factors responsible for it: competition between species and geographical isolation. But Wallace believed that evolution had a purpose ("teleology") in maintaining species' fitness to their environment, whereas Darwin hesitated to attribute any purpose to a random natural process. Scientific discoveries since the 19th century support Darwin's viewpoint, by identifying several additional mechanisms and triggers:

Wallace remained an ardent defender of natural selection for the rest of his life. By the 1880s, evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles. In 1889, Wallace published the book "<a href="Darwinism%20%28book%29">Darwinism</a>" as a response to the scientific critics of natural selection. Of all Wallace's books, it is the most cited by scholarly publications.

In 1872, at the urging of many of his friends, including Darwin, <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a>, Wallace began research for a general review of the geographic distribution of animals. He was unable to make much progress initially, in part because classification systems for many types of animals were in flux at the time. He resumed the work in earnest in 1874 after the publication of a number of new works on classification. Extending the system developed by Sclater for birds—which divided the earth into six separate geographic regions for describing species distribution—to cover mammals, reptiles and insects as well, Wallace created the basis for the <a href="ecozone">zoogeographic regions</a> still in use today. He discussed all of the factors then known to influence the current and past geographic distribution of animals within each geographical region. These included the effects of the appearance and disappearance of land bridges (such as the one currently <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">connecting North America and South America</a>) and the effects of periods of increased glaciation. He provided maps that displayed factors, such as elevation of mountains, depths of oceans, and the character of regional vegetation, that affected the distribution of animals. He also summarised all the known families and genera of the higher animals and listed their known geographic distributions. The text was organised so that it would be easy for a traveller to learn what animals could be found in a particular location. The resulting two-volume work, "The Geographical Distribution of Animals", was published in 1876 and would serve as the definitive text on <a href="zoogeography">zoogeography</a> for the next 80 years.

In this book Wallace did not confine himself to the biogeography of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that <a href="tapirs">tapirs</a> had originated in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia. Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">mass extinction of megafauna</a> in the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. In "The Geographical Distribution of Animals" (1876) he wrote, "We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared". He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, but by the time he wrote "World of Life" (1911) he had come to believe those extinctions were "due to man's agency".

In 1880, Wallace published the book "Island Life" as a sequel to "The Geographical Distribution of Animals". It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the <a href="Galapagos">Galapagos</a> and <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on whether they had recently been part of a continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>s. "Island Life" was considered a very important work at the time of its publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.

Wallace's extensive work in biogeography made him aware of the impact of human activities on the natural world. In "Tropical Nature and Other Essays" (1878), he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion, especially in tropical climates prone to heavy rainfall. Noting the complex interactions between vegetation and climate, he warned that the extensive clearing of <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (<a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>) and India would adversely impact the climate in those countries and lead to their eventual impoverishment due to soil erosion. In "Island Life", Wallace again mentioned deforestation and also the impact of <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. On the impact of European colonisation on the island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, he wrote:

... yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and forbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once all green and fertile. The cause of this change is, however, very easily explained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable deposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was protected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When this was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and has left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable destruction was caused, in the first place, by goats, which were introduced by the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588 they existed in the thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees, because they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural restoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste of man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and about the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast diminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood and ebony, were good for tanning, and, to save trouble, the bark was wastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot; while in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used to burn lime for building fortifications!

Wallace's comments on environment grew more strident later in his career. In "The World of Life" (1911) he wrote:

Wallace's 1904 book "Man's Place in the Universe" was the first serious attempt by a biologist to evaluate the <a href="planetary%20habitability">likelihood of life on other planets</a>. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar system that could possibly support life, mainly because it was the only one in which water could exist in the <a href="liquid%20phase">liquid phase</a>. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).

His treatment of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> in this book was brief, and in 1907, Wallace returned to the subject with a book "Is Mars Habitable?" to criticise the claims made by <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> that there were <a href="Martian%20canals">Martian canals</a> built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions. Among other things, Wallace pointed out that <a href="spectroscopic%20analysis">spectroscopic analysis</a> had shown no signs of <a href="water%20vapour">water vapour</a> in the <a href="Martian%20atmosphere">Martian atmosphere</a>, that Lowell's analysis of Mars's climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet-girding irrigation system, impossible. Richard Milner comments: "It was the brilliant and eccentric evolutionist Alfred Russel Wallace ... who effectively debunked Lowell's illusionary network of Martian canals." Wallace originally became interested in the topic because his <a href="anthropocentric">anthropocentric</a> philosophy inclined him to believe that man would likely be unique in the universe.

In a letter to his brother-in-law in 1861, Wallace wrote:

... I remain an utter disbeliever in almost all that you consider the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because they will not be governed by the morality of Christianity ... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; whether we have an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.

Wallace was an enthusiast of <a href="phrenology">phrenology</a>. Early in his career, he experimented with <a href="hypnosis">hypnosis</a>, then known as <a href="mesmerism">mesmerism</a>. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success. When he began his experiments with mesmerism, the topic was very controversial and early experimenters, such as <a href="John%20Elliotson">John Elliotson</a>, had been harshly criticised by the medical and scientific establishment. Wallace drew a connection between his experiences with mesmerism and his later investigations into <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>. In 1893, he wrote:

I thus learnt my first great lesson in the inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the repeated observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane and honest. The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.

Wallace began investigating spiritualism in the summer of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with it for some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at <a href="s%C3%A9ance">séance</a>s, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.

Spiritualism appealed to many educated <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorians</a> who no longer found traditional religious doctrine, such as that of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view of the world that was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a>, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists <a href="William%20Crookes">William Crookes</a> and <a href="Lord%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a>, the mathematician <a href="Augustus%20De%20Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a>, and the Scottish publisher <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>.

During the 1860s the stage magician <a href="John%20Nevil%20Maskelyne">John Nevil Maskelyne</a> exposed the trickery of the <a href="Davenport%20brothers">Davenport brothers</a>. Wallace was unable to accept that he had replicated their feats utilizing natural methods, and stated that Maskelyne possessed supernatural powers. However, in one of his writings Wallace dismissed Maskelyne, referring to a lecture exposing his tricks.

In 1874, Wallace visited the spirit photographer <a href="Frederick%20Hudson%20%28photographer%29">Frederick Hudson</a>. A photograph of him with his deceased mother was produced and Wallace declared the photograph genuine, declaring "even if he had by some means obtained possession of all the photographs ever taken of my mother, they would not have been of the slightest use to him in the manufacture of these pictures. I see no escape from the conclusion that some spiritual being, acquainted with my mother's various aspects during life, produced these recognisable impressions on the plate." However, Hudson's photographs had previously been exposed as fraudulent in 1872.

Wallace's very public advocacy of spiritualism and his repeated defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud in the 1870s damaged his scientific reputation. It strained his relationships with previously friendly scientists such as <a href="Henry%20Walter%20Bates">Henry Bates</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a>, and even Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Others, such as the physiologist <a href="William%20Benjamin%20Carpenter">William Benjamin Carpenter</a> and zoologist <a href="E.%20Ray%20Lankester">E. Ray Lankester</a> became openly and publicly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism, notably William Crookes, were subject to much criticism from the press, with "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" as the leading English medical journal of the time being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public perception of Wallace's work for the rest of his career. When, in 1879, Darwin first tried to rally support among naturalists to get a civil pension awarded to Wallace, <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> responded:

Wallace has lost caste considerably, not only by his adhesion to Spiritualism, but by the fact of his having deliberately and against the whole voice of the committee of his section of the British Association, brought about a discussion on Spiritualism at one of its sectional meetings ... This he is said to have done in an underhanded manner, and I well remember the indignation it gave rise to in the B.A. Council.

Hooker eventually relented and agreed to support the pension request.

In 1870, a <a href="Flat%20Earth">Flat-Earth</a> proponent named <a href="John%20Hampden%20%281819%E2%80%931891%29">John Hampden</a> offered a £500 wager (equivalent to about £ in present-day terms) in a magazine advertisement to anyone who could demonstrate a convex curvature in a body of water such as a river, canal, or lake. Wallace, intrigued by the challenge and short of money at the time, designed an experiment in which he set up two objects along a six-mile (10 km) stretch of canal. Both objects were at the same height above the water, and he mounted a telescope on a bridge at the same height above the water as well. When seen through the telescope, one object appeared higher than the other, showing the curvature of the earth.

The judge for the wager, the editor of "Field" magazine, declared Wallace the winner, but Hampden refused to accept the result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.

In the early 1880s, Wallace was drawn into the debate over mandatory smallpox <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a>. Wallace originally saw the issue as a matter of personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a> was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.

Another factor in Wallace's thinking was his belief that, because of the action of natural selection, organisms were in a state of balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.

In 1890, Wallace gave evidence before a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> investigating the controversy. When the commission examined the material he had submitted to support his testimony, they found errors, including some questionable statistics. "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" averred that Wallace and the other anti-vaccination activists were being selective in their choice of statistics, ignoring large quantities of data inconsistent with their position. The commission found that smallpox vaccination was effective and should remain compulsory, though they did recommend some changes in procedures to improve safety, and that the penalties for people who refused to comply be made less severe. Years later, in 1898, Wallace wrote a pamphlet, "Vaccination a Delusion; Its Penal Enforcement a Crime", attacking the commission's findings. It, in turn, was attacked by "The Lancet", which stated that it contained many of the same errors as his evidence given to the commission.

As a result of his writing, at the time of his death Wallace had been for many years a well-known figure both as a scientist and as a social activist. He was often sought out by journalists and others for his views on a variety of topics. He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>'s <a href="Royal%20Medal">Royal Medal</a> and <a href="Darwin%20Medal">Darwin Medal</a> in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural selection and his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.

He was undoubtedly one of the greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.

Recently, he has become a less obscure figure with the publication of several book-length biographies on him, as well as anthologies of his writings. In 2007 a literary critic for "New Yorker" magazine observed that five such biographies and two such anthologies had been published since 2000. There has also been a web page created that is dedicated to Wallace scholarship.
In a 2010 book, the environmentalist <a href="Tim%20Flannery">Tim Flannery</a> claimed that Wallace was 'the first modern scientist to comprehend how essential cooperation is to our survival,' and suggested that Wallace's understanding of natural selection and his later work on the atmosphere be seen as a forerunner to modern ecological thinking.

The <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, London, co-ordinated <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace%20centenary">commemorative events for the Wallace centenary</a> worldwide in the 'Wallace100' project in 2013. On 24 January, his portrait was unveiled in the Main Hall of the museum by <a href="Bill%20Bailey">Bill Bailey</a>, a fervent admirer. On the <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> programme "Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero", first broadcast on 21 April 2013, Bailey revealed how Wallace cracked evolution by revisiting places where Wallace discovered exotic species. Episode one featured <a href="orangutans">orangutans</a> and <a href="flying%20frog">flying frog</a>s in Bailey's journey through <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Episode two featured <a href="birds%20of%20paradise">birds of paradise</a>. On 7 November 2013, the 100th anniversary of Wallace's death, Sir <a href="David%20Attenborough">David Attenborough</a> unveiled a statue of Wallace at the museum. The statue was donated by the A. R. Wallace Memorial Fund, and was sculpted by <a href="Anthony%20Smith%20%28sculptor%29">Anthony Smith</a>. It depicts Wallace as a young man, collecting in the jungle. November 2013 also marked the debut of "The Animated Life of A. R. Wallace", a paper-puppet animation film dedicated to Wallace's centennial.


Wallace was a prolific author. In 2002, a historian of science published a quantitative analysis of Wallace's publications. He found that Wallace had published 22 full-length books and at least 747 shorter pieces, 508 of which were scientific papers (191 of them published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>"). He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology. An online bibliography of Wallace's writings has more than 750 entries.



A more comprehensive list of Wallace's publications that are available online, as well as a full bibliography of all of Wallace's writings, has been compiled by the historian <a href="Charles%20H.%20Smith%20%28historian%20of%20science%29">Charles H. Smith</a> at The Alfred Russel Wallace Page.

Australian Labor Party

The Australian Labor Party (ALP, also Labor, was Labour before 1912) is a <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Australia">political party in Australia</a>. The party has been in <a href="Opposition%20%28Australia%29">opposition</a> at the federal level since the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202013">2013 election</a>. <a href="Bill%20Shorten">Bill Shorten</a> has been the party's federal parliamentary leader since 13 October 2013. The party is a federal party with <a href="List%20of%20state%20branches%20of%20the%20Australian%20Labor%20Party">branches</a> in each <a href="Australian%20states%20and%20territories">state and territory</a>. Labor is in government in the states of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, and in both the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a> and <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>. The party competes against the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a>/<a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">National</a> <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Coalition</a> for political office at the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">federal</a> and <a href="Parliaments%20of%20the%20Australian%20states%20and%20territories">state</a> (and sometimes <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Australia">local</a>) levels.

Labor's constitution has long stated: "The Australian Labor Party is a <a href="Democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a> party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields". This "socialist objective" was introduced in 1921, but was later qualified by two further objectives: "maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector" and "the right to own private property". Labor governments have not attempted the "democratic socialisation" of any industry since the 1940s, when the Chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks, and in fact have <a href="privatization">privatised</a> several industries such as aviation and banking. Labor's current National Platform describes the party as "a modern <a href="Social%20democracy">social democratic</a> party", "the party of opportunity and security for working people" and "a party of active government".

The ALP was not founded as a federal party until after the first sitting of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Australian Parliament</a> in 1901. Nevertheless, it is regarded as descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging <a href="Australian%20labour%20movement">labour movement in Australia</a>, formally beginning in 1891. Labor is thus the country's oldest political party. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201901">1901 federal election</a>. The ALP formed the world's first <a href="List%20of%20Labour%20Parties">Labour Party</a> government, indeed the world's first <a href="socialist">socialist</a> or <a href="social%20democratic">social democratic</a> government, at a national level. Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian Parliament, at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201910">1910 federal election</a>. The Australian Labor Party at both a federal and state/colony level pre-dates, among others, both the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Labour Party</a> and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a> in party formation, government, and policy implementation. Internationally, the ALP is a member of the <a href="Progressive%20Alliance%20%28political%20international%29">Progressive Alliance</a> network of social-democratic parties, having previously been a member of the <a href="Socialist%20International">Socialist International</a>.

The Australian Labor Party has its origins in the Labour parties founded in the 1890s in the Australian colonies prior to federation. Labor tradition ascribes the founding of Queensland Labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the "<a href="Tree%20of%20Knowledge%20%28Australia%29">Tree of Knowledge</a>") in <a href="Barcaldine%2C%20Queensland">Barcaldine, Queensland</a> in 1891. The <a href="Balmain%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Balmain, New South Wales</a> branch of the party claims to be the oldest in Australia. Labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Branch%29">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">South Australia</a>, 1893 in Queensland, and later in the other colonies.

The first election contested by Labour candidates was the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20colonial%20election%2C%201891">1891 New South Wales election</a>, when Labour candidates (then called the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales) won 35 of 141 seats. The major parties were the <a href="Protectionist%20Party">Protectionist</a> and <a href="Free%20Trade%20Party">Free Trade</a> parties and Labour held the <a href="Balance%20of%20power%20%28parliament%29">balance of power</a>. It offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions. The <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">United Labor Party (ULP) of South Australia</a> was founded in 1891, and three candidates were that year elected to the <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">South Australian Legislative Council</a>. The first successful <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">South Australian House of Assembly</a> candidate was <a href="John%20McPherson">John McPherson</a> at the <a href="East%20Adelaide%20by-election%2C%201892">1892 East Adelaide by-election</a>. <a href="Richard%20Hooper%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Richard Hooper</a> however was elected as an Independent Labor candidate at the <a href="Wallaroo%20by-election%2C%201891">1891 Wallaroo by-election</a>, while he was the first Labor member of the House of Assembly he was not a member of the newly formed ULP.

At the <a href="South%20Australian%20colonial%20election%2C%201893">1893 South Australian elections</a> the ULP was immediately elevated to balance of power status with 10 of 54 lower house seats. The liberal government of <a href="Charles%20Kingston">Charles Kingston</a> was formed with the support of the ULP, ousting the conservative government of <a href="John%20Downer">John Downer</a>. So successful, less than a decade later at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201905">1905 election</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28South%20Australia%20politician%29">Thomas Price</a> would form the world's first stable Labor government. <a href="John%20Verran">John Verran</a> led Labor to form the state's first of many <a href="majority%20government">majority government</a>s at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201910">1910 election</a>.

In 1899, <a href="Anderson%20Dawson">Anderson Dawson</a> formed a minority Labour government in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, the first in the world, which lasted one week while the <a href="Conservatism">conservatives</a> regrouped after a split.

The colonial Labour parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation of Australia</a>. Some Labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming that the Senate as proposed was too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist colonial upper houses and the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">British House of Lords</a>. They feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The first Labour leader and Prime Minister, <a href="Chris%20Watson">Chris Watson</a>, however, was a supporter of federation.

Historian Celia Hamilton, examining New South Wales, argues for the central role of Irish Catholics. Before 1890, they opposed Henry Parkes, the main Liberal leader, and of free trade, seeing them both as the ideals of Protestant Englishmen who represented landholding and large business interests. In the strike of 1890 the leading Catholic, Sydney's Archbishop <a href="Patrick%20Francis%20Moran">Patrick Francis Moran</a> was sympathetic toward unions, but Catholic newspapers were negative. After 1900, says Hamilton, Irish Catholics were drawn to the Labour Party because its stress on equality and social welfare fitted with their status as manual labourers and small farmers. In the 1910 elections Labour gained in the more Catholic areas and the representation of Catholics increased in Labour's parliamentary ranks.

The <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201901">federal parliament in 1901</a> was contested by each state Labour Party. In total, they won 14 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives, collectively holding the balance of power, and the Labour members now met as the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party (informally known as the <a href="caucus">caucus</a>) on 8 May 1901 at <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Melbourne">Parliament House, Melbourne</a>, the meeting place of the first federal Parliament. The caucus decided to support the incumbent <a href="Protectionist%20Party">Protectionist Party</a> in <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a>, while the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Party">Free Trade Party</a> formed the <a href="Opposition%20%28Australia%29">opposition</a>. It was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level. Labour under <a href="Chris%20Watson">Chris Watson</a> doubled its vote at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201903">1903 federal election</a> and continued to hold the balance of power. In April 1904, however, Watson and <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a> fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the <a href="Conciliation">Conciliation</a> and <a href="Arbitration">Arbitration</a> Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Free Trade leader <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a> declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, and the world's first Labour head of government at a national level (<a href="Anderson%20Dawson">Anderson Dawson</a> had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), though his was a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> that lasted only four months. He was aged only 37, and is still the youngest Prime Minister in Australia's history.

<a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a> of the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Party">Free Trade Party</a> adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201906">1906 federal election</a>, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party. Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the <a href="Protectionist%20Party">Protectionist Party</a> in the middle. This attempt struck a chord with politicians who were steeped in the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster tradition</a> and regarded a <a href="two-party%20system">two-party system</a> as very much the norm.

Though Watson further strengthened Labour's position in 1906, he stepped down from the leadership the following year, to be succeeded by <a href="Andrew%20Fisher">Andrew Fisher</a> who formed a minority government lasting seven months from late 1908 to mid 1909. At the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201910">1910 election</a>, Fisher led Labor to victory, forming Australia's first elected federal <a href="majority%20government">majority government</a>, Australia's first elected <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> majority, the world's first <a href="List%20of%20Labour%20Parties">Labour Party</a> majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 <a href="Chris%20Watson">Chris Watson</a> minority government the world's second Labour Party government at a national level. It was the first time a Labour Party had controlled any house of a legislature, and the first time the party controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature. The state branches were also successful, except in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, where the strength of <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Deakinite</a> liberalism inhibited the party's growth. The state branches formed their first majority governments in <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election%2C%201910">New South Wales</a> and <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201910">South Australia in 1910</a>, <a href="Western%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201911">Western Australia in 1911</a>, <a href="Queensland%20state%20election%2C%201915">Queensland in 1915</a> and <a href="Tasmanian%20state%20election%2C%201925">Tasmania in 1925</a>. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.

Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals "a band of unhappy amateurs", made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, a doctor, and even a mine owner, indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of free trade between the colonies – in the first grouping of state MPs, 17 of the 35 were free-traders.

In the aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for "the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange." The 1922 <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20National%20Conference">Labor Party National Conference</a> adopted a similarly worded "socialist objective," which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the "<a href="Maurice%20Blackburn">Blackburn</a> amendment," which said that "socialisation" was desirable only when was necessary to "eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features." In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry (<a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a>'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court</a> to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and <a href="privatisation">privatisation</a> of state enterprises such as <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> airways and the <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth Bank</a>.

The Labor Party is commonly described as a <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a> party. The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a <a href="White%20Australia%20Policy">White Australia Policy</a>, a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes. Labor has at various times supported high <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s and low tariffs, <a href="conscription">conscription</a> and <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>, White Australia and <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>, <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> and <a href="privatisation">privatisation</a>, <a href="isolationism">isolationism</a> and internationalism.

Historically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the <a href="White%20Australia%20Policy">White Australia Policy</a>, which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about "<a href="Racial%20hygiene">racial purity</a>" and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when the <a href="Chifley%20Government">Chifley Government</a> launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of <a href="Arthur%20Calwell">Arthur Calwell</a> as leader in 1967. Subsequently, Labor has become an advocate of <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>, although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.

The ALP adopted the formal name "Australian Labour Party" in 1908, but changed the spelling to "Labor" in 1912. While it is standard practice in <a href="Australian%20English">Australian English</a> both today and at the time to spell the word "labour" with a "u", the party was influenced by the <a href="Labor%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States labor movement</a>, and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the American-born <a href="King%20O%27Malley">King O'Malley</a>, was successful in having the spelling "modernised". The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a> in general. ("See also <a href="Australian%20spelling">Spelling in Australian English</a>".)

In South Australia the United Labor Party became the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party on 14 September 1917.

The <a href="Curtin%20Government">Curtin</a> and <a href="Chifley%20Government">Chifley</a> governments governed Australia through the latter half of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and initial stages of transition to peace. Labor leader <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> became prime minister in October 1941 when two independents crossed the floor of Parliament. Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>. In December 1941, Curtin announced that "Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom", thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as <a href="ANZUS">ANZUS</a> by the <a href="Menzies%20Government">Menzies Government</a>). Remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201943">1943 election</a>, Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a>. Chifley Labor won the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201946">1946 election</a> and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peacetime economy. Labor was defeated at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201949">1949 election</a>. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifley sought to define the labour movement as having:

To a large extent, Chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions. With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office in 1949 to <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>' Liberal-National Coalition. Labor commenced what would be a 23-year period in opposition.

Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, resulting in what is now known as the <a href="Socialist%20Left%20%28Australia%29">Socialist Left</a> who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more <a href="social%20progressivism">socially progressive</a> ideals, and <a href="Labor%20Right">Labor Right</a>, the now dominant faction that tends to be more <a href="economic%20liberalism">economically liberal</a> and focus to a lesser extent on social issues. The Whitlam Labor government, marking a break with Labor's socialist tradition, pursued <a href="social%20democracy">social-democratic</a> policies rather than <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialist</a> policies. Whitlam, in contrast to earlier Labor leaders, also cut <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s by 25 percent. Whitlam led the Federal Labor Party back to office at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201972">1972</a> and <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201974">1974 elections</a>, and passed a large amount of legislation. The <a href="Whitlam%20Government">Whitlam Government</a> lost office following the <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">1975 Australian constitutional crisis</a> and dismissal by <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> Sir <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28governor-general%29">John Kerr</a> after the Coalition blocked <a href="Loss%20of%20supply">supply</a> in the Senate after a series of political scandals, and was defeated at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">1975 election</a>. Whitlam remains the only Prime Minister to have his commission terminated in that manner.

<a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> led Labor back to office at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201983">1983 election</a> and the <a href="Hawke-Keating%20Government">Hawke-Keating Government</a> remained in power until defeated by <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201996">1996 election</a>.

<a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> led the party to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201998">1998 election</a>, winning 51 percent of the <a href="two-party%20preferred%20vote">two-party preferred vote</a> but falling short on seats, and lost ground at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202001">2001 election</a>. <a href="Mark%20Latham">Mark Latham</a> led Labor to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202004">2004 election</a> but lost further ground. Beazley replaced Latham in 2005. Beazley in turn was challenged by <a href="Kevin%20Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a> who went on to defeat John Howard at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 election</a> with 52.7 percent of the two-party vote. The <a href="First%20Rudd%20Government">Rudd Government</a> ended prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202010">2010 election</a> with the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a>. The <a href="Gillard%20Government">Gillard Government</a> was commissioned to govern in a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a> following the 2010 election with a one-seat parliamentary majority and 50.12 percent of the two-party vote.

Between the 2007 federal election and the <a href="Western%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202008">2008 Western Australian state election</a>, Labor was in government nationally, as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures. This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government. Labor narrowly lost government in Western Australia at the 2008 state election and Victoria at the <a href="Victorian%20state%20election%2C%202010">2010 state election</a>. These losses were further compounded by landslide defeats in New South Wales in <a href="2011%20New%20South%20Wales%20State%20Election">2011</a>, Queensland in <a href="Queensland%20state%20election%2C%202012">2012</a>, the Northern Territory in <a href="Northern%20Territory%20general%20election%2C%202012">2012</a>, Federally in <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202013">2013</a> and Tasmania in <a href="Tasmanian%20state%20election%2C%202014">2014</a>. Labor secured a good result in the Australian Capital Territory in <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20general%20election%2C%202012">2012</a> and, despite losing its majority, the party retained government in South Australia in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202014">2014</a>.

However, most of these reversals proved only temporary with Labor returning to government in Victoria in <a href="Victorian%20state%20election%2C%202014">2014</a> and in Queensland in <a href="Queensland%20state%20election%2C%202015">2015</a> after spending only one term in opposition in both states. Furthermore, after winning the <a href="Fisher%20state%20by-election%2C%202014">2014 Fisher by-election</a> by nine votes from a 7.3 percent swing, the Labor government in South Australia went from minority to majority government. Labor won landslide victories in the <a href="Northern%20Territory%20general%20election%2C%202016">2016 Northern Territory election</a> and the <a href="Western%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202017">2017 Western Australian election</a>.

The policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labor's National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Party's website, "The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government."

The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that "Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely." While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: "Labor believes in a strong role for national government – the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote." Labor "will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions." The platform and Labor "believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential." For Labor, "government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status." Further sections of the platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.

In practice, the platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the platform, Labor governments have sought to change the platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the platform.

The <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20National%20Executive">Australian Labor Party National Executive</a> is the chief administrative authority of the Australian Labor Party, subject only to Labor's <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20National%20Conference">National Conference</a>. The Executive is responsible for organising the triennial National Conference; carrying out the decisions of National Conference; interpreting the National Constitution, the National Platform and decisions of National Conference; and directing federal members.

The party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference decides the party's platform, elects the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20National%20Executive">national executive</a>, and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is <a href="Noah%20Carroll">Noah Carroll</a>. The most recent National Conference was the 47th conference held from 24 to 26 July 2015.

The head office of the ALP, the National Secretariat, is managed by the National Secretary. It plays a dual role of administration and national campaign strategy. It acts as a permanent secretariat to the National Executive by managing and assisting in all administrative affairs of the party. As the National Secretary also serves as national campaign director during elections, it is also responsible for national campaign strategy and organisation.

The elected members of the Labor party in both houses of the national Parliament meet as the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, also known as the <a href="Caucus">Caucus</a>. Besides discussing parliamentary business and tactics, the Caucus also is involved in the election of the federal parliamentary leaders. Until 2013 the parliamentary leaders were elected by the Caucus from among its members. The leader has historically been a member of the House of Representatives. Since October 2013, a ballot of both the Caucus and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members determined the party leader and the deputy leader. When the Labor Party is in government, the party leader is the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> and the deputy leader is the <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a>. If a Labor prime minister resigns or dies in office, the deputy leader acts as prime minister and party leader until a successor is elected. Members of the Ministry are also chosen by Caucus, though the leader may allocate portfolios to the ministers.

The Australian Labor Party is a federal party, consisting of eight branches from each state and territory. While the National Executive is responsible for national campaign strategy, each state and territory are an autonomous branch and are responsible for campaigning in their own jurisdictions for federal, state and local elections. State and territory branches consist of both individual members and <a href="affiliated%20trade%20union">affiliated trade union</a>s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office.

Members join a state branch and pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. The majority of <a href="Australian%20labour%20movement">trade unions in Australia</a> are affiliated to the party at a state level. Union affiliation is direct and not through the <a href="Australian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a>. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are <a href="Political%20donations%20in%20Australia">political donations</a> and <a href="Elections%20in%20Australia%23Public%20funding">public funding</a>.

Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.

The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). However, <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28ACT%20Branch%29">ACT Labor</a> directly elects its president. The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.

In some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates. In others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called <a href="preselection">preselection</a>. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.

Country Labor is a subsection of the ALP, and is used as a designation by candidates contesting elections in rural areas. It functions as a sort of <a href="ginger%20group">ginger group</a> within the party, and is somewhat analogous to <a href="Australian%20Young%20Labor">its youth wing</a>. The Country Labor Party is registered as a separate party in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, and is also registered with the <a href="Australian%20Electoral%20Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a> (AEC) for federal elections. It does not have the same status in other states, and consequently that designation cannot be used on the ballot paper.

The creation of a separation designation for rural candidates was first suggested at the June 1999 ALP state conference in New South Wales. In May 2000, following Labor's success at the <a href="Benalla%20state%20by-election%2C%202000">2000 Benalla by-election</a> in Victoria, <a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> announced that the ALP intended to register a separate "Country Labor Party" with the AEC; this occurred in October 2000. The Country Labor designation is most frequently used in New South Wales. According to the ALP's financial statements for the 2015–16 financial year, NSW Country Labor had around 2,600 members (around 17 percent of the party total), but almost no assets. It recorded a severe funding shortfall at the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election%2C%202015">2015 NSW state election</a>, and had to rely on a $1.68-million loan from the party proper to remain solvent. It had been initially assumed that the party proper could provide the money from its own resources, but the NSW Electoral Commission ruled that this was impermissible because the parties were registered separately. Instead the party proper had to loan Country Labor the required funds at a commercial interest rate.

Australian Young Labor is the youth wing of the Australian Labor Party, where all members under age 26 are automatically members. It is the peak youth body within the ALP. Former Presidents of AYL have included former NSW Premier Bob Carr, Federal Manager of Opposition Business Tony Burke, former Special Minister of State Senator John Faulkner, former Australian Workers Union National Secretary and current Member for Maribyrnong and Federal Labor Leader Bill Shorten as well as dozens of State Ministers and MPs. The current national president is Jack Boyd, from the New South Wales Right.

The Australian Labor Party is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. The national platform currently encourages state branches to formally establish these groups known as policy action caucuses. Examples of such groups include the <a href="Labor%20Environment%20Action%20Network">Labor Environment Action Network</a>, Rainbow Labor, and Labor for Refugees. The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently gave these groups voting and speaking rights at their state conference.

The Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are <a href="Labor%20Unity">Labor Unity</a> (National Right) and the <a href="Socialist%20Left%20%28Australia%29">Socialist Left</a> (National Left). Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The Socialist Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more liberal on social issues. The national factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based such as Centre Unity in New South Wales and Labor Forum in Queensland.

Some trade unions are affiliated with the Labor Party and are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right faction are the <a href="Australian%20Workers%27%20Union">Australian Workers' Union</a> (AWU), the <a href="Shop%2C%20Distributive%20and%20Allied%20Employees%27%20Association">Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association</a> (SDA), the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Workers">National Union of Workers</a> (NUW) and the <a href="Transport%20Workers%20Union%20of%20Australia">Transport Workers Union</a> (TWU). Important unions supporting the left include the <a href="Australian%20Manufacturing%20Workers%20Union">Australian Manufacturing Workers Union</a> (AMWU), <a href="United%20Voice">United Voice</a>, the <a href="Construction%2C%20Forestry%2C%20Mining%20and%20Energy%20Union">Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union</a> (CFMEU) and the <a href="Maritime%20Union%20of%20Australia">Maritime Union of Australia</a> (MUA). These affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. In some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments. On other issues, such as opposition to the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a>'s industrial relations policy, called <a href="WorkChoices">WorkChoices</a>, most unions were in agreement.

<a href="Preselection">Preselection</a>s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with <a href="Cheryl%20Kernot">Cheryl Kernot</a> in 1998 and again with <a href="Peter%20Garrett">Peter Garrett</a> in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of <a href="branch%20stacking">branch stacking</a> (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), <a href="personation">personation</a>, multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20National%20Executive">National Executive</a> is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.

The current leader of the ALP is <a href="Bill%20Shorten">Bill Shorten</a> since 13 October 2013, and the deputy leader is <a href="Tanya%20Plibersek">Tanya Plibersek</a>. In accordance with party rules, Shorten's leadership was reaffirmed by party members on 8 July 2016, following the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202016">2016 federal election</a>.

Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)

The Dodo is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> appearing in Chapters 2 and 3 of the book "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" by <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a> (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson). The Dodo is a caricature of the author. A popular but unsubstantiated belief is that Dodgson chose the particular animal to represent himself because of his stammer, and thus would accidentally introduce himself as "Do-do-dodgson". Historically, the Dodo was a non-flying bird that lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It faced extinction after the colonisation of the island by the Dutch.

In this passage Lewis Carroll incorporated references to the original boating expedition of 4 July 1862 during which Alice's Adventures were first told, with <a href="Alice%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Alice</a> as herself, and the others represented by birds: the <a href="Lory%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Lory</a> was Lorina Liddell, <a href="the%20Eaglet">the Eaglet</a> was Edith Liddell, the Dodo was Dodgson, and the <a href="Duck%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Duck</a> was Rev. <a href="Robinson%20Duckworth">Robinson Duckworth</a>. In order to get dry after a swim, the Dodo proposes that everyone run a Caucus race — where the participants run in patterns of any shape, starting and leaving off <a href="equality%20of%20outcome">whenever they like, so that everyone wins</a>. At the end of the race, Alice distributes <a href="comfits">comfits</a> from her pocket to all as prizes. However this leaves no prize for herself. The Dodo inquires what else she has in her pocket. As she has only a <a href="thimble">thimble</a>, the Dodo requests it from her and then awards it to Alice as her prize. The Caucus Race as depicted by Carroll is a <a href="satire">satire</a> on the <a href="politics">political</a> <a href="caucus">caucus</a> system, mocking its lack of clarity and decisiveness.

In the Disney film, the Dodo plays a much greater role in the story. He is merged with the character of <a href="Pat%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Pat the Gardener</a>, which leads to him sometimes being nicknamed Pat the Dodo, but this name is never mentioned in the film. The Dodo is also the leader of the caucus race, a role originally held by the <a href="Mouse%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Mouse</a>. He has the appearance and personality of a sea captain. The Dodo is voiced by <a href="Bill%20Thompson%20%28voice%20actor%29">Bill Thompson</a> and animated by <a href="Milt%20Kahl">Milt Kahl</a>.

Dodo is first seen as <a href="Alice%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Alice</a> is floating on the sea in a bottle. Dodo is seen singing, but when Alice asks him for help, he does not notice her. On shore, Dodo is seen on a rock, organizing a caucus race. This race involves running around until one gets dry, but the attempts are hampered by incoming waves.
Dodo is later summoned by the <a href="White%20Rabbit">White Rabbit</a>, when the rabbit believes a monster, actually Alice having magically grown to a giant size, is inside his home. Dodo brings <a href="Bill%20the%20Lizard">Bill the Lizard</a>, and attempts to get him to go down the chimney. Bill refuses at first, but Dodo is able to convince him otherwise. However, the soot causes Alice to sneeze, sending Bill high up into the sky. Dodo then decides to burn the house down, much to the chagrin of the White Rabbit. He begins gathering wood, such as the furniture, for this purpose. However, Alice is soon able to return to a smaller size and exit the house.

The White Rabbit soon leaves, while Dodo asks for matches, not realizing that the situation has been resolved. He then asks Alice for a match, but when she doesn't have any, Dodo complains about the lack of cooperation and uses his pipe to light the fire.

The Dodo later appears briefly at the end of the film, conducting another Caucus Race.
In <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>'s adaptation of <a href="Alice%20in%20Wonderland%20%282010%20film%29">Alice in Wonderland</a>, the Dodo's appearance retains the subtle apparent nature from <a href="John%20Tenniel">John Tenniel</a>'s illustration. He bears a down of brilliant blue and wears a blue coat and white spats along with glasses and a cane. He is one of Alice's good-willed advisers, taking first note of her abilities as the true Alice. He is also one of the oldest inhabitants. His name is Uilleam, and he is portrayed by Michael Gough. He goes with the <a href="White%20Rabbit">White Rabbit</a>, <a href="Tweedledee%20and%20Tweedledum">Tweedledee and Tweedledum</a>, and <a href="Dormouse%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Dormouse</a> to take Alice to <a href="Caterpillar%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Caterpillar</a> to decide whether Alice is the real one. He is later captured by the <a href="Red%20Queen%20%28Through%20the%20Looking%20Glass%29">Red Queen</a>'s forces. When Alice came to the Red Queen's castle, he was seen at the Red Queen's castle yard as a caddy for the Queen's croquet game. After the Red Queen orders the release of the <a href="Jubjub%20bird">Jubjub bird</a>, he is then seen briefly running from it when the Tweedles went to hide from it and escaped.

His name may be based on a lecture on <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> from Chapter Three of the original novel. The character is voiced by <a href="Michael%20Gough">Michael Gough</a> in his final feature film role before his death in 2011. Gough came out of retirement to appear in the film but the character only speaks three lines, so Gough managed to record in one day. Unlike most of the other creatures, Uilleam doesn’t appear in the end battle scene.

In the anime and manga series "<a href="Pandora%20Hearts">Pandora Hearts</a>" Dodo is the chain of Rufus Barma one of the four dukedoms.

Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach

Albert II (; 28 March 15228 January 1557) was the <a href="Margrave">Margrave</a> of <a href="Principality%20of%20Bayreuth">Brandenburg-Kulmbach</a> (Brandenburg-Bayreuth) from 1527 to 1553.
He was a member of the <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>n branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">House of Hohenzollern</a>.
Because of his bellicose nature, Albert during his lifetime was given the cognomen "Bellator" ("the Warlike"). 
Posthumously, he became known as "<a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>".

Albert was born in <a href="Ansbach">Ansbach</a> and, having lost his father <a href="Casimir%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Casimir</a> in 1527, he came under the guardianship of his uncle <a href="George%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach</a>, a strong adherent of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>.
In 1541, he received <a href="Bayreuth">Bayreuth</a> as his share of the family lands, but, as the chief town of his principality was <a href="Kulmbach">Kulmbach</a>, he is sometimes referred to as the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.
His restless and turbulent nature marked him out for a military career; and having collected a small band of soldiers, he assisted Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> in his <a href="Italian%20War%20of%201542%E2%80%931546">war with France</a> in 1543.

The <a href="Peace%20of%20Cr%C3%A9py">Peace of Crépy</a> in September 1544 deprived him of this employment, but he had won a considerable reputation, and when Charles was preparing to attack the <a href="Schmalkaldic%20League">Schmalkaldic League</a>, he took pains to win Albert's assistance.

Sharing in the attack on the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Saxony">Electorate of Saxony</a>, Albert was taken prisoner at <a href="Rochlitz">Rochlitz</a> in March 1547 by Elector <a href="John%20Frederick%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">John Frederick</a> of Saxony, but was released as a result of the Emperor's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20M%C3%BChlberg">Battle of Mühlberg</a> in the succeeding April.

He then followed the fortunes of his friend Elector <a href="Maurice%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Maurice</a> of Saxony, deserted Charles, and joined the league which proposed to overthrow the Emperor by an alliance with King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">Henry II of France</a>.

He took part in the subsequent campaign, but when the <a href="Peace%20of%20Passau">Peace of Passau</a> was signed in August 1552 he separated himself from his allies and began a crusade of plunder in <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>, which led to the <a href="Second%20Margrave%20War">Second Margrave War</a>.

Having extorted a large sum of money from the citizens of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, he quarrelled with his supporter, the French King, and offered his services to the Emperor.
Charles, anxious to secure such a famous fighter, gladly assented to Albert's demands and gave the imperial sanction to his possession of the lands taken from the bishops of <a href="Bishopric%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a> and <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Bamberg">Bamberg</a>; and his conspicuous bravery was of great value to the Emperor on the retreat from the <a href="Siege%20of%20Metz%20%281552%29">Siege of Metz</a> in January 1553.

When Charles left Germany a few weeks later, Albert renewed his depredations in Franconia. These soon became so serious that a league was formed to crush him, and Maurice of Saxony led an army against his former comrade.
The rival forces met at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sievershausen">Sievershausen</a> on 9 July 1553, and after a combat of unusual ferocity Albert was put to flight. <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Henry, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, then took command of the troops of the league, and after Albert had been placed under the imperial ban in December 1553 he was defeated by Duke Henry, and compelled to flee to France.
He there entered the service of Henry II of France and had undertaken a campaign to regain his lands when he died at <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a> on 8 January 1557.

He is defined by <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> as "a failure of a <a href="Fritz">Fritz</a>," with "features" of a <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick the Great</a> in him, "but who burnt away his splendid qualities as a mere temporary shine for the able editors, and never came to anything, full of fire, too much of it wildfire, not in the least like an Alcibiades except in the change of fortune he underwent". He had early two children: <a href="Friedrich%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Frederick</a> and <a href="Anna%20of%20Brandenburg-Bayreuth">Anna</a>. He was to be buried Heilsbronn Münster.

Albert the Bear

Albert the Bear (; ; 1100 – 18 November 1170) was the first <a href="Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Margrave of Brandenburg</a> (as Albert I) from 1157 to his death and was briefly <a href="Duke%20of%20Saxony">Duke of Saxony</a> between 1138 and 1142.

Albert was the only son of <a href="Otto%2C%20Count%20of%20Ballenstedt">Otto, Count of Ballenstedt</a>, and <a href="Eilika%20of%20Saxony">Eilika</a>, daughter of <a href="Magnus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxony">Magnus Billung</a>, <a href="Rulers%20of%20Saxony">Duke of Saxony</a>. He inherited the valuable estates in northern Saxony of his father in 1123, and on his mother's death, in 1142, succeeded to one-half of the lands of the house of <a href="Billung">Billung</a>. Albert was a loyal <a href="vassal">vassal</a> of his relation, <a href="Lothair%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Lothar I, Duke of Saxony</a>, from whom, about 1123, he received the Margraviate of <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>, to the east; after Lothar became <a href="King%20of%20the%20Germans">King of the Germans</a>, he accompanied him on a disastrous expedition to <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> against the upstart, <a href="Sob%C4%9Bslav%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bohemia">Soběslav I, Duke of Bohemia</a> in 1126 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chlumec">Battle of Kulm</a>, where he suffered a short imprisonment.

Albert's entanglements in Saxony stemmed from his desire to expand his inherited estates there. After the death of his brother-in-law, <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Margrave%20of%20the%20Nordmark">Henry II, Margrave of the Nordmark</a>, who controlled a small area on the Elbe called the Saxon <a href="Northern%20March">Northern March</a>, in 1128, Albert, disappointed at not receiving this fief himself, attacked <a href="Udo%20IV%2C%20Margrave%20of%20the%20Nordmark">Udo V, Count of Stade</a>, the heir, and was consequently deprived of Lusatia by Lothar. Udo, however, was said to have been assassinated by servants of Albert on 15 March 1130 near <a href="Aschersleben">Aschersleben</a>. In spite of this, he went to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1132 in the train of the king, and his services there were rewarded in 1134 by the investiture of the Northern March, which was again without a ruler.

In 1138 <a href="Conrad%20III%20of%20Germany">Conrad III</a>, the Hohenstaufen King of the Germans, deprived Albert's cousin and nemesis, <a href="Henry%20X%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Henry the Proud</a> of his Saxon duchy, which was awarded to Albert if he could take it. After some initial success in his efforts to take possession, Albert was driven from Saxony, and also from his Northern march by a combined force of Henry and <a href="Jaxa%20of%20K%C3%B6penick">Jaxa of Köpenick</a>, and compelled to take refuge in south Germany. When peace was made with Henry in 1142, Albert renounced the Saxon duchy and received the counties of <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> and <a href="Orlam%C3%BCnde">Orlamünde</a>. It was possibly at this time that Albert was made Archchamberlain of the Empire, an office which afterwards gave the Margraves of Brandenburg the rights of a <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a>.

Once he was firmly established in the Northern March, Albert's covetous eye lay also on the thinly populated lands to the north and east. For three years he was occupied in campaigns against the Slavic <a href="Wends">Wends</a>, who as pagans were considered fair game, and whose subjugation to Christianity was the aim of the <a href="Wendish%20Crusade">Wendish Crusade</a> of 1147 in which Albert took part. Albert was a part of the army that besieged <a href="Demmin">Demmin</a>. And at the end of the war, recovered <a href="Havelberg">Havelberg</a>, which had been lost since 983. Diplomatic measures were more successful, and by an arrangement made with the last of the Wendish princes of Brandenburg, <a href="Pribislav%20of%20Brandenburg">Pribislav</a> of the <a href="Hevelli">Hevelli</a>, Albert secured this district when the prince died in 1150. Taking the title "Margrave in Brandenburg", he pressed the "crusade" against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, encouraged German migration, established bishoprics under his protection, and so became the founder of the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> in 1157, which his heirs — the <a href="House%20of%20Ascania">House of Ascania</a> — held until the line died out in 1320.

In 1158 a feud with Henry's son, <a href="Henry%20the%20Lion">Henry the Lion</a>, Duke of Saxony, was interrupted by a pilgrimage to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>. On his return in 1160, he, with the consent of his sons; Siegfried not being mentioned, donated land to the <a href="Knights%20of%20Saint%20John">Knights of Saint John</a> in memory of his wife, Sofia, at <a href="Werben%20%28Elbe%29">Werben</a> at the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. In 1162 Albert accompanied Emperor <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barbarossa</a> to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, where he distinguished himself at the storming of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>.

In 1164 Albert joined a league of princes formed against Henry the Lion, and peace being made in 1169, Albert divided his territories among his six sons. He died on 13 November 1170, possibly in <a href="Stendal">Stendal</a>, and was buried at <a href="Ballenstedt">Ballenstedt</a>.

Albert's personal qualities won for him the <a href="cognomen">cognomen</a> of "the <a href="Bear">Bear</a>," "not from his looks or qualities, for he was a tall handsome man, but from the cognisance on his shield, an able man, had a quick eye as well as a strong hand, and could pick what way was straightest among crooked things, was the shining figure and the great man of the North in his day, got much in the North and kept it, got Brandenburg for one there, a conspicuous country ever since," says <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Carlyle</a>, who called Albert "a restless, much-managing, wide-warring man." He is also called by later writers "the Handsome."

Albert was married in 1124 to <a href="Sophie%20of%20Winzenburg">Sophie of Winzenburg</a> (died 25 March 1160) and they had the following children:

Albert of Brandenburg

Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg (; 28 June 149024 September 1545) was <a href="Prince-elector">Elector</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Mainz">Archbishop of Mainz</a> from 1514 to 1545, and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Magdeburg">Archbishop of Magdeburg</a> from 1513 to 1545.

Born in <a href="K%C3%B6lln">Kölln</a> on the Spree, Albert was the younger son of <a href="John%20Cicero%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg</a> and of <a href="Margaret%20of%20Thuringia">Margaret of Thuringia</a>.

After their father's funeral, Albert and his older brother <a href="Joachim%20I%20Nestor">Joachim I Nestor</a> became <a href="Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">margraves of Brandenburg</a> in 1499, but only his older brother held the title of an <a href="elector%20of%20Brandenburg">elector of Brandenburg</a>. Having studied at the University of <a href="Frankfurt%20%28Oder%29">Frankfurt (Oder)</a>, Albert entered the ecclesiastical profession, and in 1513 became <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> of <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> at the age of 23 and administrator of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Halberstadt">Diocese of Halberstadt</a>.

In 1514 he obtained the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Mainz">Electorate of Mainz</a>, and in 1518, at the age of 28, was made a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a>. To pay for the <a href="pallium">pallium</a> of the <a href="Holy%20See">see of Mainz</a> and to discharge the other expenses of his elevation, Albert had borrowed 21,000 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s from <a href="Jakob%20Fugger">Jakob Fugger</a>, "[Fugger article says 48,000 ducats]" and had obtained permission from <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> to conduct the sale of <a href="indulgences">indulgences</a> in his diocese to obtain funds to repay this loan, as long as he forwarded half of the income to the Papacy. An agent of the Fuggers subsequently traveled in the Cardinal's retinue in charge of the cashbox. He procured the services of <a href="John%20Tetzel">John Tetzel</a> to sell the indulgences.

Largely in reaction to the commerce in indulgences, <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> wrote his famous <a href="95%20Theses">95 Theses</a>, which led to the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. Luther sent these to Albert on 31 October 1517, and according to tradition nailed a copy to the door of Castle Church in <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>. Albert forwarded the theses to Rome, suspecting Luther of heresy. When the <a href="imperial%20election">imperial election</a> of 1519 drew near, partisans of the two leading candidates (<a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">King Charles I of Spain</a> and <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a>, King of France) eagerly solicited the vote of the Prince-Archbishop of Mainz, and Albert appears to have received a large amount of money for his vote. The electors eventually chose Charles, who became the Emperor Charles V.

Albert's large and liberal ideas, his friendship with <a href="Ulrich%20von%20Hutten">Ulrich von Hutten</a>, and his political ambitions, appear to have raised hopes that he could be won over to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>; but after the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a> of 1525 he ranged himself definitely among the supporters of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholicism</a>, and was among the princes who joined the <a href="League%20of%20Dessau">League of Dessau</a> in July 1525.

Cardinal Albert needed a prestigious church building that met his expectations at a central location in his "<a href="Residenz">Residenz</a>" town. Albert feared for his peace of mind in heaven, and collected more than 8,100 <a href="relics%23Roman%20Catholic%20classification%20and%20prohibitions">relics</a> and 42 holy <a href="human%20skeleton">skeletons</a> which needed to be stored. These precious treasures, known as "Hallesches Heilthum", indirectly related to the sale of <a href="indulgences">indulgences</a> which had triggered the Reformation a few years before. Then the cardinal and the Roman Catholic members of the town council wanted to repress the growing influence of <a href="the%20Reformation">the Reformation</a> by holding far grander <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">masses</a> and <a href="church%20service">services</a> in a new church dedicated solely to Saint Mary.
Albert's hostility towards the reformers, however, was not so extreme as that of his brother <a href="Joachim%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg</a>; and he appears to have exerted himself towards peace, although he was a member of the League of Nuremberg, formed in 1538 as a counterpoise to the <a href="League%20of%20Schmalkalden">League of Schmalkalden</a>. The new doctrines nevertheless made considerable progress in his dominions, and he was compelled to grant religious liberty to the inhabitants of Magdeburg in return for 500,000 <a href="florin">florin</a>s. During his later years showed more intolerance towards the Protestants, and favored the teaching of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a> in his dominions.

The <a href="Marktkirche%20Unser%20Lieben%20Frauen">Market Church of Our Lady</a> in Halle, which had been built to defend against the spread of <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> sympathies, was the very spot where <a href="Justus%20Jonas">Justus Jonas</a> officially introduced the Reformation into Halle with his <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> sermon in 1541. The service must have been at least partly conducted in the open air, because at that time construction had only been finished at the eastern end of the nave. Jonas began a successful preaching crusade and attracted so many people that the church overflowed. Cardinal Albert left the town permanently after the <a href="Estates%20of%20the%20realm">estates</a> ("Stände") in the city had announced that they would take over his enormous debt at the bank of <a href="Jacob%20Fugger">Jacob Fugger</a>. Halle became Protestant and in 1542 Jonas was appointed as priest to St. Mary's and in 1544 bishop over the city.

Albert adorned the <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a> ("Stiftskirche") at <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle (Saale)</a> and the <a href="Mainz%20Cathedral">cathedral at Mainz</a> in sumptuous fashion, and took as his motto the words "Domine, dilexi decorem domus tuae" (Latin for: "Lord, I admired the adornment of your house."). A generous patron of art and learning, he counted <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> among his friends.

Albert died at the <a href="Martinsburg%2C%20Mainz">Martinsburg, Mainz</a> in 1545.

Albert, Duke of Prussia

Albert of Prussia (German: Albrecht von Preussen, 17 May 149020 March 1568) was the 37th <a href="Grand%20Masters%20of%20the%20Teutonic%20Knights">Grand Master</a> of the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>, who after converting to <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>, became the first ruler of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Duchy of Prussia</a>, the secularized state that emerged from the former <a href="Monastic%20State%20of%20the%20Teutonic%20Knights">Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights</a>. Albert was the first European ruler to establish Lutheranism, and thus <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, as the official <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a> of his lands. He proved instrumental in the political spread of Protestantism in its early stage, ruling the Prussian lands for nearly six decades (1510–1568).

A member of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Ansbach">Brandenburg-Ansbach</a> branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">House of Hohenzollern</a>, Albert became Grand Master, where his skill in political administration and leadership ultimately succeeded in reversing the decline of the Teutonic Order. But Albert, who was sympathetic to the demands of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, rebelled against the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> by converting the Teutonic state into a Protestant and hereditary realm, the Duchy of Prussia, for which he paid homage to his uncle, the <a href="Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old">King of Poland, Sigismund I</a>. That arrangement was confirmed by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Krak%C3%B3w">Treaty of Kraków</a> in 1525. Albert pledged a personal oath to the King and in return was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs.

Albert's rule in Prussia was fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the confiscation of the lands and treasures of the Catholic Church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and provide for the expenses of the newly established Prussian court. He was active in imperial politics, joining the <a href="League%20of%20Torgau">League of Torgau</a> in 1526, and acted in unison with the Protestants in plotting to overthrow Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> after the issue of the <a href="Augsburg%20Interim">Augsburg Interim</a> in May 1548. Albert established schools in every town and founded <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20University">Königsberg University</a> in 1544. He promoted culture and arts, patronising the works of <a href="Erasmus%20Reinhold">Erasmus Reinhold</a> and <a href="Caspar%20Hennenberger">Caspar Hennenberger</a>. During the final years of his rule, Albert was forced to raise taxes instead of further confiscating now-depleted church lands, causing peasant rebellion. The intrigues of the court favourites <a href="Johann%20Funck">Johann Funck</a> and <a href="Paul%20Skali%C4%87">Paul Skalić</a> also led to various religious and political disputes. Albert spent his final years virtually deprived of power and died at <a href="Tapiau">Tapiau</a> on 20 March 1568. His son, <a href="Albert%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20Prussia">Albert Frederick</a>, succeeded him as Duke of Prussia.

Albert's dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, paving the way for the rise of the House of Hohenzollern. He is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation, and even as indirectly responsible for the <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a>.

Albert was born in <a href="Ansbach">Ansbach</a> in <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a> as the third son of <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach</a>. His mother was <a href="Sophia%20of%20Poland">Sophia</a>, daughter of <a href="Casimir%20IV%20Jagiellon">Casimir IV Jagiellon</a>, Grand Duke of <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20%281385%E2%80%931569%29">Poland</a>, and his wife <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Austria%20%28d.%201505%29">Elisabeth of Austria</a>. He was raised for a career in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Church</a> and spent some time at the court of <a href="Hermann%20IV%20of%20Hesse">Hermann IV of Hesse</a>, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Cologne">Elector of Cologne</a>, who appointed him canon of the <a href="Cologne%20Cathedral">Cologne Cathedral</a>.
Not only was he quite religious; he was also interested in mathematics and science and sometimes is claimed to have contradicted the teachings of the Church in favour of scientific theories. His career was forwarded by the Church, however, and institutions of the Catholic clerics supported his early advancement.

Turning to a more active life, Albert accompanied Emperor <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1508 and after his return spent some time in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>.

<a href="Duke%20Frederick%20of%20Saxony">Duke Frederick of Saxony</a>, Grand Master of the <a href="Teutonic%20Order">Teutonic Order</a>, died in December 1510. Albert was chosen as his successor early in 1511 in the hope that his relationship to his maternal uncle, <a href="Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old">Sigismund I the Old</a>, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, would facilitate a settlement of the disputes over eastern <a href="Prussia%20%28region%29">Prussia</a>, which had been held by the order under Polish <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> since the <a href="Second%20Peace%20of%20Thorn%20%281466%29">Second Peace of Thorn (1466)</a>.

The new Grand Master, aware of his duties to the empire and to the papacy, refused to submit to the crown of Poland. As war over the order's existence appeared inevitable, Albert made strenuous efforts to secure allies and carried on protracted negotiations with Emperor Maximilian I. The ill-feeling, influenced by the ravages of members of the Order in Poland, culminated in <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Teutonic%20War%20%281519%E2%80%931521%29">a war</a> which began in December 1519 and devastated Prussia. Albert was granted a four-year truce early in 1521.

The dispute was referred to Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> and other princes, but as no settlement was reached Albert continued his efforts to obtain help in view of a renewal of the war. For this purpose he visited the <a href="Diet%20of%20Nuremberg">Diet of Nuremberg</a> in 1522, where he made the acquaintance of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformer</a> <a href="Andreas%20Osiander">Andreas Osiander</a>, by whose influence Albert was won over to <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>.

The Grand Master then journeyed to <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a>, where he was advised by <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> to abandon the rules of his order, to marry, and to convert Prussia into a hereditary duchy for himself. This proposal, which was understandably appealing to Albert, had already been discussed by some of his relatives; but it was necessary to proceed cautiously, and he assured <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20VI">Pope Adrian VI</a> that he was anxious to reform the order and punish the knights who had adopted <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> doctrines. Luther for his part did not stop at the suggestion, but in order to facilitate the change made special efforts to spread his teaching among the Prussians, while Albert's brother, Margrave <a href="George%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">George of Brandenburg-Ansbach</a>, laid the scheme before their uncle, <a href="Sigismund%20I%20the%20Old">Sigismund I the Old</a> of Poland.

After some delay Sigismund assented to the offer, with the provision that Prussia should be treated as a Polish fiefdom; and after this arrangement had been confirmed by a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Krak%C3%B3w">treaty concluded at Kraków</a>, Albert pledged a <a href="Prussian%20Homage">personal oath</a> to Sigismund I and was invested with the duchy for himself and his heirs on 10 February 1525.

The <a href="Estates%20of%20the%20realm">Estates</a> of the land then met at <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> and took the oath of allegiance to the new duke, who used his full powers to promote the doctrines of Luther. This transition did not, however, take place without protest. Summoned before the imperial court of justice, Albert refused to appear and was proscribed, while the order elected a new Grand Master, <a href="Walter%20von%20Cronberg">Walter von Cronberg</a>, who received Prussia as a fief at the imperial <a href="Diet%20of%20Augsburg">Diet of Augsburg</a>. As the German princes were experiencing the tumult of the Reformation, the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a>, and the <a href="Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe">wars against the Ottoman Turks</a>, they did not enforce the ban on the duke, and agitation against him soon died away.

In imperial politics Albert was fairly active. Joining the <a href="League%20of%20Torgau">League of Torgau</a> in 1526, he acted in unison with the Protestants, and was among the princes who banded and plotted together to overthrow Charles V after the issue of the <a href="Augsburg%20Interim">Augsburg Interim</a> in May 1548. For various reasons, however, poverty and personal inclination among others, he did not take a prominent part in the military operations of this period.
The early years of Albert's rule in Prussia were fairly prosperous. Although he had some trouble with the peasantry, the lands and treasures of the church enabled him to propitiate the nobles and for a time to provide for the expenses of the court. He did something for the furtherance of learning by establishing schools in every town and by freeing serfs who adopted a scholastic life. In 1544, in spite of some opposition, he founded <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20University">Königsberg University</a>, where he appointed his friend Andreas Osiander to a professorship in 1549. Albert also paid for the printing of the Astronomical "<a href="Prutenic%20Tables">Prutenic Tables</a>" compiled by <a href="Erasmus%20Reinhold">Erasmus Reinhold</a> and the first maps of Prussia by <a href="Caspar%20Hennenberger">Caspar Hennenberger</a>.

Osiander's appointment was the beginning of the troubles which clouded the closing years of Albert's reign. Osiander's divergence from Luther's doctrine of <a href="Justification%20%28theology%29">justification</a> by faith involved him in a violent quarrel with <a href="Philip%20Melanchthon">Philip Melanchthon</a>, who had adherents in Königsberg, and these theological disputes soon created an uproar in the town. The duke strenuously supported Osiander, and the area of the quarrel soon broadened. There were no longer church lands available with which to conciliate the nobles, the burden of taxation was heavy, and Albert's rule became unpopular.

After Osiander's death in 1552, Albert favoured a preacher named <a href="Johann%20Funck">Johann Funck</a>, who, with an adventurer named <a href="Paul%20Skali%C4%87">Paul Skalić</a>, exercised great influence over him and obtained considerable wealth at public expense. The state of turmoil caused by these religious and political disputes was increased by the possibility of Albert's early death and the need, should that happen, to appoint a <a href="regent">regent</a>, as his only son, <a href="Albert%20Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20Prussia">Albert Frederick</a> was still a mere youth. The duke was forced to consent to a condemnation of the teaching of Osiander, and the climax came in 1566 when the <a href="Estates%20of%20the%20realm">Estates</a> appealed to King <a href="Sigismund%20II%20Augustus">Sigismund II Augustus</a> of Poland, Albert's cousin, who sent a commission to Königsberg. Skalić saved his life by flight, but Funck was executed. The question of the regency was settled, and a form of Lutheranism was adopted and declared binding on all teachers and preachers.
Virtually deprived of power, the duke lived for two more years, and died at <a href="Gvardeysk">Tapiau</a> on 20 March 1568 of the plague, along with his wife. <a href="Cornelis%20Floris%20de%20Vriendt">Cornelis Floris de Vriendt</a> designed his tomb within <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20Cathedral">Königsberg Cathedral</a>.

Albert was a voluminous letter writer, and corresponded with many of the leading personages of the time.

Although Albert has received relatively little recognition in German history, his dissolution of the Teutonic State caused the founding of the Duchy of Prussia, which would eventually become arguably the most powerful German state and instrumental in uniting the whole of Germany. Albert is therefore often seen as the father of the Prussian nation, and even as indirectly responsible for the <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a>. He was a skilled political administrator and leader, and effectively reversed the decline of the Teutonic Order, until he betrayed it by transforming the order's lands into his own duchy, secularizing it in the process.

Albert was the first German noble to support Luther's ideas and in 1544 founded the <a href="University%20of%20K%C3%B6nigsberg">University of Königsberg</a>, the Albertina, as a rival to the Roman Catholic <a href="Cracow%20Academy">Cracow Academy</a>. It was the second Lutheran university in the German states, after the <a href="University%20of%20Marburg">University of Marburg</a>.

A <a href="relief">relief</a> of Albert over the Renaissance-era portal of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20Castle">Königsberg Castle</a>'s southern wing was created by Andreas Hess in 1551 according to plans by Christoph Römer. Another relief by an unknown artist was included in the wall of the Albertina's original campus. This depiction, which showed the duke with his sword over his shoulder, was the popular "Albertus", the symbol of the university. The original was moved to <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20Public%20Library">Königsberg Public Library</a> to protect it from the elements, while the sculptor <a href="Paul%20Kimritz">Paul Kimritz</a> created a duplicate for the wall. Another version of the "Albertus" by Lothar Sauer was included at the entrance of the <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20State%20and%20Royal%20Library">Königsberg State and Royal Library</a>.

In 1880 <a href="Friedrich%20Reusch">Friedrich Reusch</a> created a sandstone bust of Albert at the Regierungsgebäude, the administrative building for <a href="Regierungsbezirk%20K%C3%B6nigsberg">Regierungsbezirk Königsberg</a>. On 19 May 1891 Reusch premiered a famous statue of Albert at <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg%20Castle">Königsberg Castle</a> with the inscription: "Albert of Brandenburg, Last Grand Master, First Duke in Prussia". <a href="Albert%20Wolff%20%28sculptor%29">Albert Wolff</a> also designed an equestrian statue of Albert located at the new campus of the Albertina. <a href="King%27s%20Gate%20%28Kaliningrad%29">King's Gate</a> contains a statue of Albert.

Albert was oft-honored in the quarter <a href="Maraunenhof">Maraunenhof</a> in northern Königsberg. Its main street was named Herzog-Albrecht-Allee in 1906. Its town square, König-Ottokar-Platz, was renamed Herzog-Albrecht-Platz in 1934 to match its church, the <a href="Herzog-Albrecht-Ged%C3%A4chtniskirche">Herzog-Albrecht-Gedächtniskirche</a>.

Albert married first, to Princess <a href="Dorothea%20of%20Denmark%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Prussia">Dorothea</a> (1 August 150411 April 1547), daughter of King <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Denmark">Frederick I of Denmark</a>, in 1526. They had six children:


He married secondly to <a href="Anna%20Marie%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Anna Maria</a> (1532–20 March 1568), daughter of <a href="Eric%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Eric I</a>, Duke of <a href="Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, in 1550. The couple had two children:

Aachen

Aachen () or Bad Aachen, French and traditional English: Aix-la-Chapelle (), is a <a href="spa%20town">spa</a> and <a href="border%20city">border city</a> in <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. Aachen developed from a <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Emperors</a> were crowned <a href="List%20of%20German%20monarchs">Kings of the Germans</a>.

Aachen is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, west south west of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> in a former coal-mining area. One of Germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology, the <a href="RWTH%20Aachen%20University">RWTH Aachen University</a> is located in the city. Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology. In 2009, Aachen was ranked eighth among cities in Germany for innovation.

The name "Aachen" is a modern descendant, like southern <a href="German%20language">German</a> "Ach(e)", "Aach", meaning "river" or "stream", from <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "ahha", meaning "water" or "stream", which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds to) <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Aquae", referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm <a href="mineral%20spring">mineral spring</a>s. Latin "Aquae" figures in Aachen's <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> name "Aquae granni", which meant "waters of <a href="Grannus">Grannus</a>", referring to the <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> god of healing who was worshipped at the springs. This word became "Åxhe" in <a href="Walloon%20language">Walloon</a> and "Aix" in French, and subsequently "Aix-la-Chapelle" after <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> had his <a href="Palatine%20Chapel%2C%20Aachen">palatine chapel</a> built there in the late eighth century and then made the city his empire's capital.

Aachen's name in French and German evolved in parallel. The city is known by a variety of different names in other languages:
Aachen is at the western end of the <a href="Benrath%20line">Benrath line</a> that divides <a href="High%20German%20languages">High German</a> to the south from the rest of the <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic</a> speech area to the north. Aachen's local dialect is called "<a href="Aachen%20dialect">Öcher Platt</a>" and belongs to the <a href="Ripuarian%20language">Ripuarian language</a>.

Flint quarries on the <a href="Lousberg">Lousberg</a>, Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times (3000–2500 BC), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's "Elisengarten" pointing to a former settlement from the same period. <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, the area was settled by Celtic peoples who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's <a href="hot%20spring">hot sulphur springs</a> where they worshipped <a href="Grannus">Grannus</a>, god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, around AD 124. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel, adding at the end of the same century the "Münstertherme" spa, two water pipelines, and a probable sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community. The Romans built bathhouses near <a href="Burtscheid">Burtscheid</a>. A temple precinct called "Vernenum" was built near the modern <a href="Kornelim%C3%BCnster/Walheim">Kornelimünster/Walheim</a>. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses, including two fountains in the "Elisenbrunnen" and the Burtscheid bathhouse.

Roman civil administration in Aachen broke down between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries. Rome withdrew its troops from the area, but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the <a href="Ripuarian%20Franks">Ripuarian Franks</a> and subordinated to their capital, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>.

After Roman times, <a href="Pepin%20the%20Short">Pepin the Short</a> had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> and northern France. <a href="Einhard">Einhard</a> mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at "Aquis villa" (""), ("and [he] celebrated Christmas in the town Aquis, and similarly Easter") which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as king of the <a href="Francia">Franks</a>, 768, <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time. He remained there in a mansion which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the <a href="Palatine%20Chapel%20in%20Aachen">Palatine Chapel</a> (since 1930, cathedral) and the <a href="Palace%20of%20Aachen">Palace</a>. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the "<a href="Karlsschrein">Karlsschrein</a>", the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never officially acknowledged by the Roman Curia as such.

In 936, <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I</a> was crowned king of <a href="East%20Francia">East Francia</a> in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. During the reign of <a href="Otto%20II">Otto II</a>, the nobles revolted and the <a href="West%20Francia">West Frank</a>s, under <a href="Lothair%20of%20France">Lothair</a>, raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion. Aachen was attacked again by <a href="Odo%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Blois">Odo of Champagne</a>, who attacked the imperial palace while <a href="Conrad%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Conrad II</a> was absent. Odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards. The palace and town of Aachen had fortifying walls built by order of Emperor <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barbarossa</a> between 1172 and 1176. Over the next 500 years, most kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Germany">Germany</a> destined to reign over the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> were crowned in Aachen. The original audience hall built by Charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current <a href="Aachen%20Rathaus">city hall</a> in 1330. The last king to be crowned here was <a href="Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand I</a> in 1531. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>; it achieved a modest position in the trade in <a href="wool">wool</a>len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a <a href="free%20imperial%20city">free imperial city</a>, subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over <a href="Burtscheid">Burtscheid</a>, a neighbouring territory ruled by a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="abbess">abbess</a>. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the "Aachener Reich". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20J%C3%BClich">duke of Jülich</a>; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the <a href="Council%20of%20837">Council of 837</a> and the <a href="Council%20of%201166">Council of 1166</a>, a council convened by the <a href="antipope">antipope</a> <a href="Paschal%20III">Paschal III</a>.

Aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts. Under Charlemagne's purview, both the <a href="Aachen%20Gospels%20%28Ada%20School%29">Ada Gospels</a> and the <a href="Coronation%20Gospel">Coronation Gospel</a>s may have been produced in Aachen. In addition, quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally. During the reign of <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis the Pious</a> (814–840), substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at Aachen, including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group, <a href="patristic">patristic</a> texts including the five manuscripts of the <a href="Bamberg%20Pliny%20Group">Bamberg Pliny Group</a>. Finally, under <a href="Lothair%20I">Lothair I</a> (840–855), texts of outstanding quality were still being produced. This however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at Aachen.

In 1598, following the invasion of <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish</a> troops from the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolf</a> deposed all Protestant office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city. From the early 16th century, Aachen started to lose its power and influence. First the coronations of emperors were moved from Aachen to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>. This was followed by the religious wars, and the great fire of 1656. After the destruction of most of the city in 1656, the rebuilding was mostly in the <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> style. The decline of Aachen culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General <a href="Charles%20Dumouriez">Charles Dumouriez</a>, occupied Aachen.

By the middle of the 17th century Aachen had become attractive as a spa: not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then – and remained well into the 19th century – a place of high-level prostitution. Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history are found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main <a href="Indication%20%28medicine%29">indication</a> for visiting patients, ironically, was <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>; only by the end of the 19th century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the <a href="Congress%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281668%29">first congress of Aachen</a> (often referred to as the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in English) on 2 May 1668, leading to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281668%29">First Treaty of Aachen</a> in the same year which ended the <a href="War%20of%20Devolution">War of Devolution</a>. The <a href="Congress%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">second congress</a> ended with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281748%29">second treaty</a> in 1748, ending the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>. In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis in the Aachen government, and in 1794 Aachen lost its status as a <a href="free%20imperial%20city">free imperial city</a>.

On 9 February 1801, the <a href="Peace%20of%20Lun%C3%A9ville">Peace of Lunéville</a> removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire "left bank" of the Rhine from Germany and granted it to France. In 1815, control of the town was passed to <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, by an act passed by the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>. The <a href="Congress%20of%20Aix-la-Chapelle%20%281818%29">third congress</a> took place in 1818, to decide the fate of occupied <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his "Ansichten vom Niederrhein") until 1801, when Aachen became the "<a href="Prefectures%20in%20France">chef-lieu</a> du <a href="Roer%20%28department%29">département de la Roer</a>" in Napoleon's <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>. In 1815, after the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a> took over. The city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century. Administered within the <a href="Rhine%20Province">Rhine Province</a>, by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> to <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> passed through Aachen. The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until 1875, when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new, better housing was built in the east of the city, where sanitary drainage was easiest. In December 1880, the <a href="Trams%20in%20Aachen">Aachen tramway network</a> was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified. In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, <a href="pin">pin</a>s, <a href="sewing%20needle">needles</a>, <a href="clothing%20button">button</a>s, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.

After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930, along with the rest of German territory west of the Rhine. Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated <a href="Rhenish%20Republic">Rhenish Republic</a>. On 21 October 1923, an armed band took over the city hall. Similar actions took place in <a href="M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Mönchen-Gladbach</a>, <a href="Duisburg">Duisburg</a>, and <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a>. This republic lasted only about a year. Aachen was heavily damaged during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from 12 September to 21 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division with the 3rd Armored Division assisting from the south. Around 13 October the US 2nd Armored Division played their part, coming from the north and getting as close as <a href="W%C3%BCrselen">Würselen</a>, while the 30th Infantry Division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of Aachen on 16 October 1944. With reinforcements from the US 28th Infantry Division the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aachen">Battle of Aachen</a> then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city, which finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944. Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators. The city was destroyed partially – and in some parts completely – during the fighting, mostly by <a href="United%20States%20Army">American</a> <a href="artillery">artillery</a> fire and demolitions carried out by the <a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a> defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of <a href="Foillan">St. Foillan</a>, <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">St. Paul</a> and <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">St. Nicholas</a>, and the <a href="Aachen%20Rathaus">Rathaus</a> (city hall), although <a href="Aachen%20Cathedral">Aachen Cathedral</a> was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, <a href="Franz%20Oppenhoff">Franz Oppenhoff</a>, was assassinated by an SS commando unit.

During the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> community. Later, during the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace. In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> to <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a>. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Aachen Minster (today’s cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of <a href="Burtscheid">Burtscheid</a>. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20III">Friedrich Wilhelm III</a>. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (אש).

The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading <a href="Institute%20of%20Technology">universities of technology</a> in Germany with the <a href="RWTH%20Aachen">RWTH Aachen</a> (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital <a href="Klinikum%20Aachen">Klinikum Aachen</a>, one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.

Aachen is located in the middle of the <a href="Meuse%E2%80%93Rhine%20Euroregion">Meuse–Rhine Euroregion</a>, close to the border <a href="tripoint">tripoint</a> of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The city of <a href="Heerlen">Heerlen</a> in the Netherlands lies nearby, as does <a href="Eupen">Eupen</a>, the capital of the <a href="German-speaking%20Community%20of%20Belgium">German-speaking Community of Belgium</a>, both located about from Aachen's city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the <a href="Wurm">Wurm</a> (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the <a href="Meuse">Meuse</a>, and about north of the <a href="High%20Fens">High Fens</a>, which form the northern edge of the <a href="Eifel">Eifel</a> uplands of the <a href="Rhenish%20Massif">Rhenish Massif</a>.

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are from north to south, and from east to west. The city limits are long, of which border Belgium and the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of 410 m above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at 125 m.

As the westernmost city in Germany (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate climate zone</a>, with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the <a href="Eifel">Eifel</a> and the <a href="High%20Fens">High Fens</a> and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805 mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> (with 669 mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of <a href="Foehn%20winds">Foehn winds</a> on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from <a href="inversion%20%28meteorology%29">inversion-related</a> smog. Some areas of the city have become <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a>s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.

The January average is
, while the July average is . Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.
The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> period and include <a href="carboniferous">carboniferous</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="graywacke">graywacke</a>, <a href="claystone">claystone</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. These formations are part of the <a href="Rhenish%20Massif">Rhenish Massif</a>, north of the High Fens. In the <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Pennsylvanian</a> subperiod of the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the <a href="Variscan%20orogeny">Variscan orogeny</a>. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.

During the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major <a href="pottery">pottery</a> industry in nearby <a href="Raeren">Raeren</a>) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the <a href="Aachen%20Forest">Aachen Forest</a> and the <a href="Lousberg">Lousberg</a> were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through <a href="tertiary">tertiary</a> and <a href="quaternary">quaternary</a> river and wind activities.

Along the major <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a> of the <a href="Variscan%20orogeny">Variscan orogeny</a>, there are over 30 <a href="thermal%20spring">thermal spring</a>s in Aachen and <a href="Burtscheid">Burtscheid</a>. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous <a href="active%20fault">active fault</a>s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has, in the past, been responsible for numerous earthquakes, including the 1756 <a href="D%C3%BCren">Düren</a> earthquake and the <a href="1992%20Roermond%20earthquake">1992 Roermond earthquake</a>, which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

Aachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.

The unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent. At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population. A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the <a href="RWTH%20Aachen%20University">RWTH Aachen University</a>.

The city is divided into seven administrative districts, or boroughs, each with its own district council, district leader, and district authority. The councils are elected locally by those who live within the district, and these districts are further subdivided into smaller sections for statistical purposes, with each sub-district named by a two-digit number.

The districts of Aachen, including their constituent statistical districts, are:

Regardless of official statistical designations, there are 50 neighbourhoods and communities within Aachen, here arranged by district:

The following cities and communities border Aachen, clockwise from the northwest:
<a href="Herzogenrath">Herzogenrath</a>, <a href="W%C3%BCrselen">Würselen</a>, <a href="Eschweiler">Eschweiler</a>, <a href="Stolberg%20%28Rhineland%29">Stolberg</a> and <a href="Roetgen">Roetgen</a> (which are all in the <a href="Aachen%20%28district%29">district of Aachen</a>); <a href="Raeren">Raeren</a>, <a href="Kelmis">Kelmis</a> and <a href="Plombi%C3%A8res">Plombières</a> (<a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28province%29">Lüttich Province</a> in Belgium) as well as <a href="Vaals">Vaals</a>, <a href="Gulpen-Wittem">Gulpen-Wittem</a>, <a href="Simpelveld">Simpelveld</a>, <a href="Heerlen">Heerlen</a> and <a href="Kerkrade">Kerkrade</a> (all in <a href="Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29">Limburg Province</a> in the Netherlands).

<a href="Aachen%20Cathedral">Aachen Cathedral</a> was erected on the orders of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> in AD 796 and was, on completion, in 798, the largest cathedral north of the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. It was modelled after the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Vitale">Basilica of San Vitale</a>, in <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, Italy, and was built by <a href="Odo%20of%20Metz">Odo of Metz</a>. Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the <a href="Lateran%20Palace">Lateran Palace</a>, both in quality and authority. It was originally built in the <a href="Carolingian%20architecture">Carolingian</a> style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome. On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the <a href="Ottonian%20dynasty">Ottonian</a>, with portions of the original <a href="opus%20sectile">opus sectile</a> floor still visible. The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> was added around the start of the 15th century After, <a href="Frederick%20Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a> <a href="Canonisation">canonised</a> Charlemagne, in 1165, the chapel became a destination for pilgrims. For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city. In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto III</a>. In the upper chamber of the gallery, Charlemagne's marble throne is housed. Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

Most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, including the <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> that Charlemagne was eventually laid to rest in. A bronze bear from <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> was placed inside, along with an equestrian statue from Ravenna, believed to be <a href="Theodric">Theodric</a>. These were in contrast to a wolf and a statue of <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> in the <a href="Capitoline">Capitoline</a>. Bronze pieces such as the doors and railings were cast in a local foundry, some of which have survived to the present. Finally, there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel, and where it was created. Wherever it was made, it was also a parallel to a piece in Rome, this in <a href="Old%20St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">Old St. Peter's Basilica</a>.

<a href="Aachen%20Cathedral%20Treasury">Aachen Cathedral Treasury</a> has housed, throughout its history, a collection of liturgical objects. The origin of this <a href="church%20treasure">church treasure</a> is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th, century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel). Only six of the original <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian</a> objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the <a href="Aachen%20Gospels%20%28Ada%20School%29">Aachen Gospels</a>, a <a href="diptych">diptych</a> of <a href="Christ">Christ</a>, and an early <a href="Byzantine%20silk">Byzantine silk</a>. The <a href="Coronation%20Gospels">Coronation Gospels</a> and a <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Purse">reliquary burse</a> of <a href="St.%20Stephen">St. Stephen</a> were moved to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in 1798 and the <a href="Talisman%20of%20Charlemagne">Talisman of Charlemagne</a> was given as a gift in 1804 to <a href="Josephine%20Bonaparte">Josephine Bonaparte</a> and subsequently to <a href="Rheims%20Cathedral">Rheims Cathedral</a>. 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The <a href="Lothar%20Cross">Lothar Cross</a>, the <a href="Gospels%20of%20Otto%20III">Gospels of Otto III</a> and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by <a href="Otto%20III">Otto III</a>. Part of the <a href="Aachen%20Cathedral%23Pala%20d%27Oro">Pala d'Oro</a> and a covering for the <a href="Aachen%20Gospels%20%28Ada%20School%29">Aachen Gospels</a> were made of gold donated by <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry II</a>. <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barbarossa</a> donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once "crowned" the <a href="Karlsschrein">Shrine of Charlemagne</a>, which was placed underneath in 1215. <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV</a> donated a pair of reliquaries. <a href="Louis%20XI">Louis XI</a> gave, in 1475, the crown of <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret of York</a>, and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a> and <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> both gave numerous works of art by <a href="Hans%20von%20Reutlingen">Hans von Reutlingen</a>. Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by <a href="Ewald%20Matar%C3%A9">Ewald Mataré</a>.

The <a href="Aachen%20Rathaus">Aachen Rathaus</a>, English Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall, dated from 1330, lies between two central squares, the "Markt" (marketplace) and the "Katschhof" (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist <a href="Alfred%20Rethel">Alfred Rethel</a> which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the <a href="Imperial%20Regalia">Imperial Regalia</a> are kept here.

Since 2009, the city hall has been a station on the "Route Charlemagne", a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> from 1807 by <a href="Louis-Andr%C3%A9-Gabriel%20Bouchet">Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet</a> and one of his wife <a href="Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais">Joséphine</a> from 1805 by <a href="Robert%20Lef%C3%A8vre">Robert Lefèvre</a> are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the <a href="Charlemagne%20Prize">Charlemagne Prize</a> is awarded there.

The "Grashaus", a late medieval house at the "Fischmarkt", is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the former city hall until the present building took over this function.

The "Elisenbrunnen" is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century <a href="Theater%20Aachen">theatre</a>.

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the "<a href="Ponttor">Ponttor</a>" (Pont gate), half a mile northwest of the cathedral, and the "Marschiertor" (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

<a href="St.%20Michael%27s%20Church%2C%20Aachen">St. Michael's Church, Aachen</a> was built as a church of the Aachen Jesuit Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine mannerism and a sample of a local Renaissance-architecture. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891 when the historistic architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a Greek Orthodox church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The Jewish synagogue in Aachen which was destroyed on the <a href="Night%20of%20Broken%20Glass">Night of Broken Glass</a> (<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995. One of the contributors for the reconstructions of the synagogue was <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Linden">Jürgen Linden</a>, the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.

There are numerous other notable churches and <a href="monastery">monasteries</a>, a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a> style typical of the region, a Jewish synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the <a href="Suermondt-Ludwig%20Museum">Suermondt-Ludwig Museum</a>, which has a fine sculpture collection and the <a href="Aachen%20Museum%20of%20the%20International%20Press">Aachen Museum of the International Press</a>, which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present. The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

There have been a number of spin-offs from the university's <a href="Information%20technology">IT</a> technology department.

Aachen is the administrative centre for the coal-mining industries in neighbouring places to the northeast.

Products manufactured in Aachen include electrical goods, textiles, foodstuffs (chocolate and candy), glass, machinery, rubber products, furniture, metal products. Also in and around Aachen is the production of chemicals, plastics, cosmetics, and needles and pins. Though once a major player in Aachen's economy, today glassware and textile production make up only 10% of total manufacturing jobs in the city.

In June 2010, Achim Kampker, together with Günther Schuh, founded a small company to develop Street Scooter GmbH; in August 2014, it was renamed StreetScooter GmbH. This was a privately organized research initiative at the <a href="RWTH%20Aachen%20University">RWTH Aachen University</a> which later became an independent company in Aachen. Kampker was also the founder and chairman of the <a href="European%20Network%20for%20Affordable%20and%20Sustainable%20Electromobility">European Network for Affordable and Sustainable Electromobility</a>. In May 2014, the company announced that the city of Aachen, the city council Aachen and the savings bank Aachen had ordered electric vehicles from the company. In late 2014, approximately 70 employees were manufacturing 200 vehicles annually in the premises of the <a href="Waggonfabrik%20Talbot">Waggonfabrik Talbot</a>, the former Talbot/Bombardier plant in Aachen.

In December 2014 <a href="Deutsche%20Post">Deutsche Post DHL Group</a> purchased the StreetScooter company, which became its wholly owned subsidiary. By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2000 of its electric vans branded "Work" in Aachen by the end of the year.

In April 2016, <a href="StreetScooter">StreetScooter</a> GmbH announced that it would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 of the "Work" vehicles annually, starting in 2017, also in Aachen. If that goal is achieved, it will become the largest electric light utility vehicle manufacturer in Europe, surpassing Renault which makes the smaller "<a href="Renault%20Kangoo">Kangoo Z.E.</a>".

In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an <a href="Anno%20Domini">Anno Domini</a> date on a general circulation <a href="coin">coin</a>, a <a href="groschen">groschen</a>.

The <a href="Scotch-Club">Scotch-Club</a> in Aachen was the first <a href="discoth%C3%A8que">discothèque</a>; it has been open since 19 October 1959. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.

The thriving Aachen <a href="black%20metal">black metal</a> scene is among the most notable in Germany, with such bands as <a href="Nagelfar">Nagelfar</a>, <a href="The%20Ruins%20of%20Beverast">The Ruins of Beverast</a>, Graupel and Verdunkeln.

The local speciality of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called "<a href="Aachener%20Printen">Aachener Printen</a>". Unlike "<a href="Lebkuchen">Lebkuchen</a>", a German form of <a href="gingerbread">gingerbread</a> sweetened with honey, "Printen" use a syrup made from sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

<a href="RWTH%20Aachen">RWTH Aachen University</a>, established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of <a href="German%20Universities%20Excellence%20Initiative">Germany's Universities of Excellence</a> with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the <a href="Klinikum%20Aachen">Klinikum Aachen</a>, is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe. Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a <a href="botanical%20garden">botanical garden</a> (the <a href="Botanischer%20Garten%20Aachen">Botanischer Garten Aachen</a>).

<a href="FH%20Aachen">FH Aachen</a>, <a href="Aachen%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences">Aachen University of Applied Sciences</a> (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as <a href="mechatronics">mechatronics</a>, construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or "Doppelabschlüsse" (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.

The Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen – Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia – Aachen department) offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.

The <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik%20und%20Tanz%20K%C3%B6ln">Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln</a> (<a href="Cologne%20University%20of%20Music">Cologne University of Music</a>) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe with one of its three campuses in Aachen. The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the <a href="Theater%20Aachen">Theater Aachen</a> and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.

The <a href="German%20Army">German Army</a>'s Technical School ("Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme") is in Aachen.

The annual CHIO (short for the French term "Concours Hippique International Officiel") is the biggest <a href="equestrianism">equestrian</a> meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of <a href="The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> for tennis. Aachen hosted the <a href="2006%20FEI%20World%20Equestrian%20Games">2006 FEI World Equestrian Games</a>.

The local <a href="Association%20football">football</a> team <a href="Alemannia%20Aachen">Alemannia Aachen</a> had a short run-out in Germany's <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga">first division</a>, after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium <a href="Old%20Tivoli">"Tivoli"</a>, opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division. Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium "Neuer Tivoli" – meaning <a href="New%20Tivoli">New Tivoli</a>—a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

The city's biggest tennis club, "TC Grün Weiss", annually hosts the ATP Tournament.

The Ladies In Black women's volleyball team (part of the "PTSV Aachen" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.

Aachen's railway station, the <a href="Aachen%20Central%20Station">Hauptbahnhof</a> (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the <a href="Cologne%E2%80%93Aachen%20high-speed%20railway">Cologne–Aachen railway line</a>. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, <a href="Aachen%E2%80%93M%C3%B6nchengladbach%20railway">Mönchengladbach</a> and <a href="HSL%203">Liège</a> as well as branch lines to <a href="Heerlen">Heerlen</a>, <a href="Alsdorf">Alsdorf</a>, <a href="Stolberg%20%28Rhineland%29">Stolberg</a> and <a href="Eschweiler">Eschweiler</a>. <a href="Intercity-Express">ICE high speed trains</a> from <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> via <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> to <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a> and <a href="Thalys">Thalys</a> trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four <a href="Regional-Express">RE</a> lines and two <a href="Regionalbahn">RB</a> lines connect Aachen with the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a>gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> and the <a href="Siegerland">Siegerland</a>. The "<a href="Euregiobahn">Euregiobahn</a>", a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: "<a href="Aachen%20West%20station">Aachen West</a>", "<a href="Aachen%20Schanz%20station">Aachen Schanz</a>", "<a href="Aachen-Rothe%20Erde%20station">Aachen-Rothe Erde</a>" and "<a href="Eilendorf%20station">Eilendorf</a>". Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of <a href="RWTH%20Aachen%20University">RWTH Aachen University</a>.

The first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it was with maximal in 1915 the fourth-longest tram system in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of <a href="Herzogenrath">Herzogenrath</a>, <a href="Stolberg%20%28Rheinland%29">Stolberg (Rheinland)</a>, <a href="Alsdorf">Alsdorf</a> as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of <a href="Vaals">Vaals</a>, <a href="Kelmis">Kelmis</a> (then "Altenberg") and <a href="Eupen">Eupen</a>. The Aachen tram system was linked with the <a href="Vicinal%20tramway">Belgian national interurban tram system</a>. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from not well-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals–Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name "Campusbahn" was dropped after a referendum.

Today, the ASEAG ("Aachener Straßenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG", literally "Aachen tram and power supply company") operates an long bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20R%C3%A9gionale%20Wallonne%20du%20Transport">Transport en Commun</a> and <a href="Veolia%20Transport%20Nederland">Veolia Transport Nederland</a>, respectively.
ASEAG is one of the main participants in the <a href="Aachener%20Verkehrsverbund">Aachener Verkehrsverbund</a>, a tariff association in the region.

Aachen is connected to the <a href="Autobahn">Autobahn</a> <a href="Bundesautobahn%204">A4</a> (West-East), <a href="Bundesautobahn%2044">A44</a> (North-South) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the "Europaplatz" near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.

<a href="Maastricht%20Aachen%20Airport">Maastricht Aachen Airport</a> is the main airport of Aachen and <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. It is located around 15 NM (28 km; 17 mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.

Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize () to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on <a href="Ascension%20Day">Ascension Day</a> at the <a href="Aachen%20Rathaus">City Hall</a>. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to <a href="Pope%20Francis">Pope Francis</a>.

The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and <a href="human%20rights%20in%20Europe">human rights in Europe</a>, and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an "Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal", which was awarded for the only time ever.

Agate

Agate is a <a href="cryptocrystalline">cryptocrystalline</a> variety of <a href="silica">silica</a>, chiefly <a href="chalcedony">chalcedony</a>, characterised by its fineness of grain and brightness of color. Although agates may be found in various kinds of rock, they are classically associated with <a href="volcanic">volcanic</a> rocks and can be common in certain <a href="metamorphic%20rocks">metamorphic rocks</a>.

The stone was given its name by <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> and <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a>, who discovered the stone along the shore line of the river <a href="Dirillo">Achates</a> () in present-day <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, sometime between the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE. Colorful agates and other <a href="chalcedony">chalcedonies</a> were obtained over 3,000 years ago from the Achates River, now called <a href="Dirillo">Dirillo</a>.

Agate is one of the most common materials used in the art of <a href="hardstone%20carving">hardstone carving</a>, and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites, indicating its widespread use in the ancient world; for example, archaeological recovery at the <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a> site on <a href="Crete">Crete</a> illustrates its role in <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> culture.

Most agates occur as <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodules</a> in <a href="volcanic">volcanic</a> rocks or ancient <a href="lava">lava</a>s, in former cavities produced by <a href="Volatiles%23Igneous%20petrology">volatiles</a> in the original molten mass, which were then filled, wholly or partially, by siliceous matter deposited in regular layers upon the walls. Agate has also been known to fill veins or cracks in volcanic or altered rock underlain by granitic intrusive masses. Such agates, when cut <a href="transverse%20plane">transversely</a>, exhibit a succession of <a href="parallel%20%28geometry%29">parallel</a> lines, often of extreme <a href="wikt%3Atenuity">tenuity</a>, giving a banded appearance to the section. Such stones are known as "banded agate", "riband agate" and "striped agate".

In the formation of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing <a href="silica">silica</a> in solution—derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself—percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the <a href="Vesicular%20texture">vesicles</a>. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of <a href="chalcedony">chalcedony</a> often alternate with layers of crystalline <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still <a href="Viscosity">viscous</a>, and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian <a href="geode">geode</a> lined with <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a> and weighing 35 tons was exhibited at the <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf%20Exhibition">Düsseldorf Exhibition</a> of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.

The first deposit on the wall of a cavity, forming the "skin" of the agate, is generally a dark greenish mineral substance, like <a href="celadonite">celadonite</a>, <a href="delessite">delessite</a> or "<a href="green%20earth">green earth</a>", which are rich in <a href="iron">iron</a> probably derived from the decomposition of the <a href="augite">augite</a> in the enclosing volcanic rock. This green silicate may give rise by alteration to a brown <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a> (<a href="limonite">limonite</a>), producing a rusty appearance on the outside of the agate-nodule. The outer <a href="Surface%20science">surface</a> of an agate, freed from its matrix, is often pitted and rough, apparently in consequence of the removal of the original coating. The first layer spread over the wall of the cavity has been called the "priming", and upon this base, <a href="Zeolite">zeolitic</a> minerals may be deposited.

Many agates are hollow, since deposition has not proceeded far enough to fill the cavity, and in such cases the last deposit commonly consists of <a href="Druse%20%28geology%29">drusy quartz</a>, sometimes <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a>ine, having the <a href="Apex%20%28geometry%29">apices</a> of the <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s directed towards the free space so as to form a crystal-lined cavity or geode.

When the matrix in which the agates are embedded disintegrates, they are set free. The agates are extremely resistant to weathering and remain as nodules in the <a href="soil">soil</a>, or are deposited as <a href="gravel">gravel</a> in streams and along shorelines.

A Mexican agate, showing only a single eye, has received the name of "cyclops agate." Included matter of a green, golden, red, black or other color or combinations embedded in the chalcedony and disposed in filaments and other forms suggestive of vegetable growth, gives rise to dendritic or <a href="moss%20agate">moss agate</a>. "Dendritic" agates have fern like patterns in them formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides. Other types of included matter deposited during agate-building include sagenitic growths (radial mineral crystals) and chunks of entrapped detritus (such as sand, ash, or mud). Occasionally agate fills a void left by decomposed vegetative material such as a tree limb or root and is called limb cast agate due to its appearance. <a href="Enhydro%20agate">Enhydro agate</a> contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.

"Turritella agate" is formed from silicified <a href="fossil">fossil</a> "<a href="Elimia%20tenera">Elimia tenera</a>" (erroneously considered "<a href="Turritella">Turritella</a>") shells. "E. tenera" are spiral freshwater <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s having elongated, spiral shells composed of many whorls. Similarly, <a href="coral">coral</a>, <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified wood</a> and other organic remains or porous rocks can also become agatized. Agatized coral is often referred to as <a href="Petoskey%20stone">Petoskey stone</a> or agate.

"Greek agate" is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> back to 400 BC. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads. Even though the stone had been around centuries and was known to both the Sumerians and the Egyptians, both who used the gem for decoration and for playing important parts in their religious ceremonies, any agate of this color from Sicily, once an ancient Greek colony, is called Greek agate.

"Brazilian agate" is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones interlayered with white and gray. Quartz forms within these nodules, creating a striking specimen when cut opposite the layered growth axis. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.

Certain stones, when examined in <a href="thin%20section">thin section</a>s by transmitted light, show a diffraction spectrum due to the extreme delicacy of the successive bands, whence they are termed "rainbow agates". Often agate coexists with layers or masses of opal, jasper or crystalline quartz due to ambient variations during the formation process.

"Lace agate" is a variety that exhibits a <a href="lace">lace</a>-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags (if these predominate, it is called "lattice agate"). "Crazy lace agate", found in Mexico, is often brightly colored and complexly patterned. "Blue lace agate" is found in Africa and is especially hard.

"Polyhedroid agate" is agate which has grown in a flat-sided shape similar to a <a href="polyhedron">polyhedron</a>. When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric <a href="polygon">polygon</a>s. Polyhedroid agate is thought to be found only in <a href="Para%C3%ADba">Paraíba</a> State, Brazil. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved.

Other forms of agate include Holley blue agate (also spelled "Holly blue agate"), a rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near <a href="Holley%2C%20Oregon">Holley, Oregon</a>; <a href="Lake%20Superior%20agate">Lake Superior agate</a>; carnelian agate (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; <a href="condor%20agate">condor agate</a>, tube agate (with visible flow channels or pinhole-sized "tubes"); fortification agate (with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts); <a href="Binghamite">Binghamite</a>, a variety found only in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>; <a href="fire%20agate">fire agate</a> (showing internal flash or "fire", the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite); and <a href="Patuxent%20River%20stone">Patuxent River stone</a>, a red and yellow form of agate only found in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, where it is the state gem.
Industrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for <a href="laboratory%20balance">laboratory balance</a>s and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make <a href="Mortar%20and%20pestle">mortars and pestles</a> to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for <a href="leather%20burnishing">leather burnishing</a> tools.

The decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as <a href="pins">pins</a>, <a href="brooch">brooch</a>es or other types of <a href="jewellery">jewellery</a>, paper knives, <a href="inkstand">inkstand</a>s, <a href="marbles">marbles</a> and <a href="seal%20%28emblem%29">seals</a>. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and <a href="Intarsia">Intarsia</a> art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. <a href="Idar-Oberstein">Idar-Oberstein</a> was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe. Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in <a href="Yachats%2C%20Oregon">Yachats, Oregon</a>, has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.
Respiratory diseases such as <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a> and higher <a href="Cumulative%20incidence">incidence</a> of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> among workers involved in the agate industry has been reported from India and China.

Aspirin

Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a <a href="medication">medication</a> used to treat <a href="pain">pain</a>, <a href="fever">fever</a>, or <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include <a href="Kawasaki%20disease">Kawasaki disease</a>, <a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a>, and <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>. Aspirin given shortly after a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, <a href="ischaemic%20stroke">ischaemic stroke</a>s, and <a href="Thrombus">blood clots</a>, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, particularly <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a <a href="nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a> (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s.
Common side effects include an <a href="upset%20stomach">upset stomach</a>. More significant side effects include <a href="stomach%20ulcer">stomach ulcer</a>s, <a href="stomach%20bleeding">stomach bleeding</a>, and worsening <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>, take other <a href="NSAID">NSAID</a>s, or are on <a href="anticoagulants">blood thinners</a>. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. It is not generally recommended in children with <a href="infection">infection</a>s because of the risk of <a href="Reye%27s%20syndrome">Reye's syndrome</a>. High doses may result in <a href="tinnitus">ringing in the ears</a>.
Aspirin, in the form of leaves from the <a href="willow%20tree">willow tree</a>, has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist <a href="Charles%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Gerhardt">Charles Frédéric Gerhardt</a> treated <a href="sodium%20salicylate">sodium salicylate</a> with <a href="acetyl%20chloride">acetyl chloride</a> to produce <a href="acetylsalicylic%20acid">acetylsalicylic acid</a> for the first time. In the second half of the nineteenth century, other chemists established the chemical structure and came up with more efficient methods to make it. In 1897, scientists at <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a> began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for common salicylate medicines. By 1899, Bayer had named the drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word "Aspirin" was Bayer's brand name; however, their rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to competition between many brands and formulations.
Aspirin is one of the most widely used medications globally with an estimated 40,000 <a href="tonnes">tonnes</a> (50 to 120 billion pills) being consumed each year. It is on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%27s%20List%20of%20Essential%20Medicines">World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines</a>, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a <a href="health%20system">health system</a>. Aspirin is available as a <a href="generic%20medication">generic medication</a>. The wholesale cost in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a> as of 2014 is 0.002 to 0.025 USD per dose. As of 2015 the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States is less than <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>25.
Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>, and inflammatory diseases, such as <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, <a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a>, and <a href="Kawasaki%20disease">Kawasaki disease</a>. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a>, or the risk of <a href="stroke">stroke</a> in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.

Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> for the alleviation of pain because aspirin is more likely to cause <a href="gastrointestinal%20bleeding">gastrointestinal bleeding</a>. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle <a href="cramp">cramp</a>s, <a href="bloating">bloating</a>, <a href="gastric%20distension">gastric distension</a>, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, <a href="Compound%20analgesic">combinations</a> of aspirin and <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. <a href="Effervescent">Effervescent</a> formulations of aspirin, such as <a href="Alka-Seltzer">Alka-Seltzer</a> or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s. <a href="Topical%20medication">Topical</a> aspirin may be effective for treating some types of <a href="neuropathic%20pain">neuropathic pain</a>.

Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain <a href="Headache%23Classification">types of a headache</a>, but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the <a href="International%20Classification%20of%20Headache%20Disorders">International Classification of Headache Disorders</a> distinguishes between <a href="tension%20headache">tension headache</a> (the most common), migraine, and <a href="cluster%20headache">cluster headache</a>. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.

Aspirin, especially as a component of an <a href="aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine">aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine</a> <a href="combination%20drug">combination</a>, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of <a href="sumatriptan">sumatriptan</a>. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.

Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control <a href="fever">fever</a> is due to its action on the <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a> system through its irreversible inhibition of <a href="COX">COX</a>. Although aspirin's use as an <a href="antipyretic">antipyretic</a> in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Family%20Physicians">American Academy of Family Physicians</a>, the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, and the U.S. <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA)) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of <a href="Reye%27s%20syndrome">Reye's syndrome</a>, a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection. Because of the risk of Reye's syndrome in children, in 1986, the FDA required labeling on all aspirin-containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers.

Aspirin is used as an <a href="anti-inflammatory%20agent">anti-inflammatory agent</a> for both acute and long-term <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>.

Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a> (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an <a href="ST-segment%20elevation%20MI">ST-segment elevation MI</a>, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.

For people who have already had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years prevented 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.

Studies have not found an overall benefit in the general population of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.

Aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with pre-existing disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a <a href="polypill">polypill</a> for prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin.

After <a href="percutaneous%20coronary%20intervention">percutaneous coronary intervention</a>s (PCIs), such as the placement of a <a href="coronary%20artery">coronary artery</a> <a href="stent">stent</a>, a U.S. <a href="Agency%20for%20Healthcare%20Research%20and%20Quality">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a> guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an <a href="ADP%20receptor%20inhibitor">ADP receptor inhibitor</a>, such as <a href="clopidogrel">clopidogrel</a>, <a href="prasugrel">prasugrel</a>, or <a href="ticagrelor">ticagrelor</a> to prevent <a href="thrombosis">blood clots</a>. This is called dual <a href="antiplatelet%20drug">antiplatelet therapy</a> (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.

Aspirin is thought to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is particularly beneficial for <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a> (CRC). It may also slightly reduce the risk of <a href="endometrial%20cancer">endometrial cancer</a>, <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>, and <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>.

Some conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 <a href="United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk.

Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of <a href="rheumatic%20fever">acute rheumatic fever</a>. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. <a href="Naproxen">Naproxen</a> has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.

Along with rheumatic fever, <a href="Kawasaki%20disease">Kawasaki disease</a> remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness.

Low-dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of <a href="pre-eclampsia">pre-eclampsia</a>. This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy.

For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.
A study in 100 Italian people, though, found, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were <a href="Compliance%20%28medicine%29">noncompliant</a>.
Another study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant, but some had "pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption".

Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300 mg in Britain and 325 mg (or 5 <a href="Grain%20%28unit%29">grains</a>) in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, "e.g.", 75 mg and 81 mg tablets. The 81 mg (1-grain) tablets are commonly called "baby aspirin" or "baby-strength", because they were originally—but no longer—intended to be administered to infants and children. No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75 mg and the 81 mg tablets.

In general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>. For the prevention of <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a> (MI) in someone with documented or suspected <a href="coronary%20artery%20disease">coronary artery disease</a>, much lower doses are taken once daily.

March 2009 recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in <a href="Gastrointestinal%20bleeding">gastrointestinal hemorrhage</a>. The WHI study said regular low dose (75 or 81 mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause. Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81 mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.

In children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.

Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> or <a href="naproxen">naproxen</a>, or who have <a href="salicylate%20intolerance">salicylate intolerance</a> or a more generalized <a href="drug%20intolerance">drug intolerance</a> to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with <a href="asthma">asthma</a> or NSAID-precipitated <a href="bronchospasm">bronchospasm</a>. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with <a href="peptic%20ulcer">peptic ulcer</a>s, mild <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, or <a href="gastritis">gastritis</a> seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of <a href="gastrointestinal%20hemorrhage">stomach bleeding</a> is still increased when aspirin is taken with <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a> or <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a>. People with <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a> or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause <a href="hemolytic%20anemia">hemolytic anemia</a> in people who have the genetic disease <a href="glucose-6-phosphate%20dehydrogenase%20deficiency">glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</a>, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during <a href="dengue%20fever">dengue fever</a> is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with <a href="kidney%20disease">kidney disease</a>, <a href="hyperuricemia">hyperuricemia</a>, or <a href="gout">gout</a> should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a>, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with <a href="Reye%20syndrome">Reye's syndrome</a>.

Aspirin use has been shown to increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although some <a href="Enteric%20coating">enteric-coated</a> formulations of aspirin are advertised as being "gentle to the stomach", in one study, enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk. Combining aspirin with other <a href="Nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">NSAIDs</a> has also been shown to further increase this risk. Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Blockade of COX-1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense and that taking COX-2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion. Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any "natural" supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, quercetin, resorcinol, and others.

In addition to enteric coating, "buffering" is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses <a href="magnesium%20oxide">magnesium oxide</a>. Other preparations use <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>.

Taking it with vitamin C is a more recently investigated method of protecting the stomach lining. Taking equal doses of vitamin C and aspirin may decrease the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone.

Large doses of <a href="salicylate">salicylate</a>, a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary <a href="tinnitus">tinnitus</a> (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on <a href="arachidonic%20acid">arachidonic acid</a> and <a href="NMDA%20receptor">NMDA receptor</a>s cascade.

Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute <a href="encephalopathy">encephalopathy</a> and <a href="fatty%20liver">fatty liver</a>, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the U.S. <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a <a href="Respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory infection</a>, <a href="chickenpox">chickenpox</a>, or <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a <a href="Surgeon%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Surgeon General</a>'s warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British <a href="Medicines%20and%20Healthcare%20products%20Regulatory%20Agency">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.

For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including <a href="hives">hives</a>, swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by <a href="salicylate%20intolerance">salicylate intolerance</a> and is not a true <a href="allergy">allergy</a>, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an <a href="%23Overdose">overdose</a>.

Aspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds. Aspirin may however help heal venous leg ulcers that have not healed following usual treatment.

Aspirin can induce <a href="angioedema">swelling of skin tissues</a> in some people. In one study, <a href="angioedema">angioedema</a> appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.

Aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance on <a href="MRI">MRI</a> scans of 5 to 10 mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches. Such cerebral microbleeds are important, since they often occur prior to <a href="ischemic%20stroke">ischemic stroke</a> or <a href="intracerebral%20hemorrhage">intracerebral hemorrhage</a>, <a href="Binswanger%20disease">Binswanger disease</a>, and <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

A study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in <a href="intracerebral%20hemorrhage">intracerebral hemorrhage</a> (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250 mg per day resulting in a <a href="relative%20risk">relative risk</a> of death within three months after the ICH around 2.5 (95% <a href="confidence%20interval">confidence interval</a> 1.3 to 4.6).

Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause <a href="hyperkalemia">abnormally high blood levels of potassium</a> by inducing a <a href="hyporeninemic%20hypoaldosteronism">hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronic state</a> via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.

Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.

On 9 July 2015, the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">FDA</a> toughened warnings of increased <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> and <a href="stroke">stroke</a> risk associated with <a href="nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.

Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including <a href="activated%20charcoal">activated charcoal</a>, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>, and <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a>. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100 mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300 mg/l in people taking high doses and 700–1400 mg/l following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to <a href="bismuth%20subsalicylate">bismuth subsalicylate</a>, <a href="methyl%20salicylate">methyl salicylate</a>, and <a href="sodium%20salicylate">sodium salicylate</a>.

Aspirin is known to <a href="Drug%20interaction">interact</a> with other drugs. For example, <a href="acetazolamide">acetazolamide</a> and <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a> are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the <a href="antidiabetic%20drug">antidiabetic drug</a>s <a href="tolbutamide">tolbutamide</a> and <a href="chlorpropamide">chlorpropamide</a>, <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a>, <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a>, <a href="phenytoin">phenytoin</a>, <a href="probenecid">probenecid</a>, <a href="valproic%20acid">valproic acid</a> (as well as interfering with <a href="beta%20oxidation">beta oxidation</a>, an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of <a href="spironolactone">spironolactone</a> may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with <a href="Penicillin">penicillin G</a> for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.

Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of <a href="ammonium%20acetate">ammonium acetate</a> or the <a href="acetate">acetate</a>s, <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>s, <a href="citrate">citrate</a>s, or <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>s of the <a href="alkali%20metals">alkali metals</a>. It is stable in dry air, but gradually <a href="hydrolyses">hydrolyses</a> in contact with moisture to <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic</a> and <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>s. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.

Like <a href="flour%20mill">flour mill</a>s, factories that make aspirin tablets must pay attention to how much of the powder gets into the air inside the building, because <a href="dust%20explosion">the powder-air mixture can be explosive</a>. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> in the United States of 5 mg/m (time-weighted average). In 1989, the <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) set a legal <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> for aspirin of 5 mg/m, but this was vacated by the <a href="AFL-CIO%20v.%20OSHA">AFL-CIO v. OSHA</a> decision in 1993.

The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an <a href="ester">ester</a>ification reaction. <a href="Salicylic%20acid">Salicylic acid</a> is treated with <a href="acetic%20anhydride">acetic anhydride</a>, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group into an <a href="ester">ester</a> group (R-OH → R-OCOCH). This process yields aspirin and <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a>, which is considered a <a href="byproduct">byproduct</a> of this reaction. Small amounts of <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> (and occasionally <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>) are almost always used as a <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.


Formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids.

Aspirin, an <a href="acetyl">acetyl</a> derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, with a <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> of , and a boiling point of . Its acid dissociation constant (<a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant">pK</a>) is 3.5 at .

<a href="Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29">Polymorphism</a>, or the ability of a substance to form more than one <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a>, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond "et al." A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and <a href="levetiracetam">levetiracetam</a> from hot <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>. The form II is only stable at 100<a href="Kelvin">K</a> and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric <a href="Dimer%20%28chemistry%29">dimers</a> through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) <a href="methyl">methyl</a> proton to <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.

In 1971, British <a href="pharmacologist">pharmacologist</a> <a href="John%20Robert%20Vane">John Robert Vane</a>, then employed by the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a>s and <a href="thromboxane">thromboxane</a>s. For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>, jointly with <a href="Sune%20Bergstr%C3%B6m">Sune Bergström</a> and <a href="Bengt%20Ingemar%20Samuelsson">Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson</a>. In 1984, he was made a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a>.

Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the <a href="cyclooxygenase">cyclooxygenase</a> (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a <a href="serine">serine</a> residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as <a href="diclofenac">diclofenac</a> and <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a>), which are reversible inhibitors (<a href="Suicide%20inhibition">Suicide inhibition</a>).

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of <a href="thromboxane%20A2">thromboxane A</a> in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.

Prostaglandins, local <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamic</a> thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form <a href="clot">blood clots</a>. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.

At least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, <a href="COX-2%20inhibitor">COX-2 inhibitor</a>s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.

However, several of the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as <a href="rofecoxib">rofecoxib</a> (Vioxx), have been withdrawn in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of <a href="PGI2">PGI2</a> is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

Furthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the <a href="prostaglandins">prostaglandins</a>, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a <a href="lipoxygenase">lipoxygenase</a>-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of <a href="polyunsaturated%20fatty%20acids">polyunsaturated fatty acids</a> to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to <a href="specialized%20proresolving%20mediators">specialized proresolving mediators</a> such as the aspirin-triggered <a href="lipoxin">lipoxin</a>s, aspirin-triggered <a href="resolvins">resolvins</a>, and aspirin-triggered <a href="maresin">maresin</a>s. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.

Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a> in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through <a href="NF-%CE%BAB">NF-κB</a>. NF-κB, a <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate <a href="AMP-activated%20protein%20kinase">AMP-activated protein kinase</a>, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.

Acetylsalicylic acid is a <a href="weak%20acid">weak acid</a>, and very little of it is <a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant">ionized</a> in the <a href="stomach">stomach</a> after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the <a href="acidic">acidic</a> conditions of the stomach. The increased <a href="pH">pH</a> and larger surface area of the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a> causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to <a href="albumin">albumin protein</a>, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is <a href="metabolism">metabolized</a> in the <a href="liver">liver</a>. <a href="Conjugated%20system">Conjugation</a> with <a href="glycine">glycine</a> forms <a href="salicyluric%20acid">salicyluric acid</a>, and with <a href="glucuronic%20acid">glucuronic acid</a> to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the "acyl glucuronide"; the deacetylated conjugate is the "phenolic glucuronide". These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to <a href="gentisic%20acid">gentisic acid</a>. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s become saturated and <a href="kidney">renal</a> excretion becomes increasingly important.

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), <a href="gentisic%20acid">gentisic acid</a> (< 1%), and <a href="2%2C3-Dihydroxybenzoic%20acid">2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid</a>. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in <a href="urine">urinary</a> pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.

Medicines made from <a href="willow">willow</a> and other <a href="salicylate">salicylate</a>-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> as well as the <a href="Ebers%20Papyrus">Ebers Papyrus</a> from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to their use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> and the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>, the active component of willow extract.

In 1853, chemist <a href="Charles%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Gerhardt">Charles Frédéric Gerhardt</a> treated <a href="acetyl%20chloride">acetyl chloride</a> with <a href="sodium%20salicylate">sodium salicylate</a> to produce <a href="acetylsalicylic%20acid">acetylsalicylic acid</a> for the first time; in the second half of the nineteenth century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a> began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it around the world. The word "Aspirin" was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the twentieth century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.

Aspirin's popularity declined after the development of <a href="paracetamol">acetaminophen/paracetamol</a> in 1956 and <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, <a href="John%20Vane">John Vane</a> and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases. The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in <a href="clinical%20research%20ethics">clinical research ethics</a> and <a href="guidelines%20for%20human%20subject%20research">guidelines for human subject research</a> and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women.

Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a>s and <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s.

Due to allowing the use of "Aspirin" for years by other manufacturing chemists, despite the trademark-infringing nature of the use, and its own failure to use the name for its own product when it began selling direct, Bayer lost its trademark in the United States in 1918, affirmed by court appeal in 1921. Today, aspirin is a <a href="generic%20trademark">generic word</a> in Australia, France, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, Jamaica, Colombia, the Philippines, South Africa, Ghana, the United Kingdom and the United States. Aspirin, with a capital "A", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, where the trademark is owned by Bayer, using acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.


Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used instead.

Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of <a href="laminitis">laminitis</a> in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a>; in particular, cats lack the <a href="glucuronide">glucuronide</a> conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25 mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.
The dose recommended in cats for relief of pain and fever is 10 mg/kg every 48 hours.

Abner

In the first and second <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a>, Abner (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> אֲבִינֵר "’Avinêr" meaning "Father's Light") was cousin to <a href="Saul%20the%20King">Saul</a> and commander-in-chief of his army (1 Samuel 14:50, 20:25). He is often referred to as Avner Ben Ner, meaning, the son of <a href="List%20of%20minor%20biblical%20figures%2C%20L-Z%23N">Ner</a>.

Abner is initially mentioned incidentally in Saul's history (1 Samuel 14:50, 17:55, 26:5), first appearing as the son of Ner, Saul's uncle, and the commander of Saul's army. He then comes to the story again as the commander who introduced <a href="David%20%28biblical%20king%29">David</a> to Saul following David's killing of <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a>. He is not mentioned in the account of the disastrous <a href="battle%20of%20Gilboa">battle of Gilboa</a> when Saul's power was crushed. Seizing the youngest but only surviving of Saul's sons, <a href="Ish-bosheth">Ish-bosheth</a>, Abner set him up as king over <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">Israel</a> at <a href="Mahanaim">Mahanaim</a>, east of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan</a>. <a href="David%20%28biblical%20king%29">David</a>, who was accepted as king by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> alone, was meanwhile reigning at <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a>, and for some time war was carried on between the two parties.

The only engagement between the rival factions which is told at length is noteworthy, inasmuch as it was preceded by an encounter at <a href="Gibeon%20%28ancient%20city%29">Gibeon</a> between twelve chosen men from each side, in which the whole twenty-four seem to have perished (2 Samuel 2:12). In the general engagement which followed, Abner was defeated and put to flight. He was closely pursued by <a href="Asahel">Asahel</a>, brother of <a href="Joab">Joab</a>, who is said to have been "light of foot as a wild roe" (2 Samuel 2:18). As Asahel would not desist from the pursuit, though warned, Abner was compelled to slay him in self-defence. This originated a deadly <a href="feud">feud</a> between the leaders of the opposite parties, for Joab, as next of kin to Asahel, was by the law and custom of the country the avenger of his blood. However, according to Josephus, in Antiquities, pageRank.Book 7, Chapter 1, Joab had forgiven Abner for the death of his brother, Asahel, the reason being that Abner had slain Asahel honorably in combat after he had first warned Asahel and had no other choice but to kill him out of self-defense. This battle was part of a civil war between David and Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul. After this battle Abner switched to the side of David and granted him control over the tribe of Benjamin. This act put Abner in David's favor. The real reason that Joab killed Abner was that he became a threat to his rank of general. He then justifies it later by mentioning his brother.

For some time afterward the war was carried on, the advantage being invariably on the side of David. At length, Ish-bosheth lost the main prop of his tottering cause by accusing Abner of sleeping with <a href="Rizpah">Rizpah</a> (cf. 2 Samuel 3:7), one of Saul's <a href="concubine">concubine</a>s, an alliance which, according to contemporary notions, would imply pretensions to the <a href="throne">throne</a> (cf. 2 Samuel 16:21ff.).

Abner was indignant at the rebuke, and immediately opened negotiations with David, who welcomed him on the condition that his wife <a href="Michal">Michal</a> should be restored to him. This was done, and the proceedings were ratified by a feast. Almost immediately after, however, Joab, who had been sent away, perhaps intentionally returned and slew Abner at the gate of Hebron. The ostensible motive for the <a href="assassination">assassination</a> was a desire to avenge Asahel, and this would be a sufficient justification for the deed according to the moral standard of the time. The conduct of David after the event was such as to show that he had no complicity in the act, though he could not venture to punish its perpetrators (2 Samuel 3:31-39; cf. 1 Kings 2:31ff.).

David had Abner buried in <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a>, as it states in 2 Samuel 3:31-32, "And David said to all the people who were with him, 'Rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth, and wail before Abner.' And King David went after the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron, and the king raised his voice and wept on Abner's grave, and all the people wept."

Shortly after Abner's death, Ish-bosheth was assassinated as he slept (2 Samuel 4), and David became king of the reunited kingdoms (2 Samuel 5).

The site known as the Tomb of Abner is located not far from the <a href="Cave%20of%20the%20Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a> in Hebron and receives visitors throughout the year. Many travelers have recorded visiting the tomb over the centuries.

<a href="Benjamin%20of%20Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a>, who began his journeys in 1165, wrote in the journal, "The valley of Eshkhol is north of the mountain upon which Hebron stood, and the cave of Makhpela is east thereof. A bow-shot west of the cave is the sepulchre of Abner the son of Ner."

A rabbi in the 12th century records visiting the tomb as reprinted in <a href="Elkan%20Nathan%20Adler">Elkan Nathan Adler</a>'s book "Jewish Travellers in the Middle Ages: 19 Firsthand Accounts". The account states, "I, Jacob, the son of R. Nathaniel ha Cohen, journeyed with much difficulty, but God helped me to enter the Holy Land, and I saw the graves of our righteous Patriarchs in Hebron and the grave of Abner the son of Ner." Adler postulates that the visit must have occurred prior to <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>'s capture of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 1187.

Rabbi <a href="Moses%20ben%20Mordecai%20Bassola">Moses Basola</a> records visiting the tomb in 1522. He states, "Abner's grave is in the middle of Hebron; the Muslims built a mosque over it." Another visitor in the 1500s states that "at the entrance to the market in Hebron, at the top of the hill against the wall, Abner ben Ner is buried, in a church, in a cave." This visit was recorded in Sefer Yihus ha-Tzaddiqim (pageRank.Book of Genealogy of the Righteous), a collection of <a href="Travelogues%20of%20Palestine">travelogues</a> from 1561. Abraham Moshe Lunz reprinted the book in 1896.

Menahem Mendel of Kamenitz, considered the first hotelier in the Land of Israel, wrote about the Tomb of Abner is his 1839 book "Korot Ha-Itim", which was translated into English as "The pageRank.Book of the Occurrences of the Times to Jeshurun in the Land of Israel." He states", ""Here I write of the graves of the righteous to which I paid my respects. Hebron – Described above is the character and order of behavior of those coming to pray at the Cave of ha-Machpelah. I went there, between the stores, over the grave of Avner ben Ner and was required to pay a Yishmaeli – the grave was in his courtyard – to allow me to enter."

The author and traveler <a href="J.%20J.%20Benjamin">J. J. Benjamin</a> mentioned visiting the tomb in his book "Eight Years in Asia and Africa" (1859, Hanover). He states, "On leaving the Sepulchre of the Patriarchs, and proceeding on the road leading to the Jewish quarter, to the left of the courtyard, is seen a Turkish dwelling house, by the side of which is a small grotto, to which there is a descent of several steps. This is the tomb of Abner, captain of King Saul. It is held in much esteem by the Arabs, and the proprietor of it takes care that it is always kept in the best order. He requires from those who visit it a small gratuity." 

The British scholar <a href="Israel%20Abrahams">Israel Abrahams</a> wrote in his 1912 book "The pageRank.Book of Delight and Other Papers", "Hebron was the seat of David’s rule over Judea. Abner was slain here by Joab, and was buried here – they still show Abner’s tomb in the garden of a large house within the city. By the pool at Hebron were slain the murderers of Ishbosheth..."

Over the years the tomb fell into disrepair and neglect. It was closed to the public in 1994. In 1996, a group of 12 Israeli women filed a petition with the Supreme Court requesting the government to reopen the Tomb of Abner. More requests were made over the years and eventually arrangements were made to have the site open to the general public on ten days throughout the year corresponding to the ten days that the Isaac Hall of the Cave of the Patriarchs is open. In early 2007 new <a href="Mezuzah">mezuzot</a> were affixed to the entrance of the site.

<doc id="1527" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1527" title="Ahmed I">
Ahmed I

Ahmed I ( ""; ; 18 April 1590 – 22 November 1617) was the <a href="Sultan%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan of the Ottoman Empire</a> from 1603 until his death in 1617. Ahmed's reign is noteworthy for marking the end of the Ottoman tradition of royal fratricide; henceforth Ottoman rulers would no longer execute their brothers upon accession to the throne. He is also well known for his construction of the <a href="Sultan%20Ahmed%20Mosque">Blue Mosque</a>, one of the most famous mosques in Turkey.

Ahmed was born on 18 April 1590 at the Manisa Palace, Manisa, when his father Şehzade Mehmed was still a prince and the governor of the Sanjak of Manisa. His mother was <a href="Handan%20Sultan">Handan Sultan</a>. After his grandfather <a href="Murad%20III">Murad III</a>'s death in 1595, his father came to Constantinople and ascended the throne as Sultan Mehmed III. His father ordered the execution of nineteen of his brothers and half brothers. His elder brother <a href="%C5%9Eehzade%20Mahmud%20%28son%20of%20Mehmed%20III%29">Şehzade Mahmud</a> was also executed by his own father on 7 June 1603, just before his own death on 22 December 1603. Mahmud was buried along with his mother in a separate mausoleum built by Ahmed in <a href="%C5%9Eehzade%20Mosque">Şehzade Mosque</a>, Constantinople.

Ahmed ascended the throne after his father's death in 1603, at the age of thirteen, when his powerful grandmother <a href="Safiye%20Sultan">Safiye Sultan</a> was still alive. A far lost uncle of Ahmed, <a href="Sultan%20Yahya">Yahya</a>, resented his accession to the throne and spent his life scheming to become Sultan. Ahmed broke with the traditional fratricide following previous enthronements and did not order the execution of his brother Mustafa. Instead Mustafa was sent to live at the old palace at Bayezit along with their grandmother Safiye Sultan. This was most likely due to Ahmed's young age - he had not yet demonstrated his ability to sire children, and Mustafa was then the only other candidate for the Ottoman throne. His brother's execution would have endangered the dynasty, and thus he was spared.

In the earlier part of his reign Ahmed I showed decision and vigor, which were belied by his subsequent conduct. The wars in <a href="Ottoman%20Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="Safavid%20Dynasty">Persia</a>, which attended his accession, terminated unfavourably for the empire. Its prestige was further tarnished in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Sitvatorok">Treaty of Zsitvatorok</a>, signed in 1606, whereby the annual tribute paid by <a href="Archduchy%20of%20Austria">Austria</a> was abolished. Following the crushing defeat in the <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Safavid%20War%20%281603%E2%80%9318%29">Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)</a> against the neighbouring rivals <a href="Safavid%20Empire">Safavid Empire</a>, led by Shah <a href="Abbas%20the%20Great">Abbas the Great</a>, Georgia, Azerbaijan and other vast territories in the Caucasus were ceded back to Persia per the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nasuh%20Pasha">Treaty of Nasuh Pasha</a> in 1612, territories that had been temporarily conquered in the <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Safavid%20War%20%281578%E2%80%9390%29">Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)</a>. The new borders were drawn per the same line as confirmed in the <a href="Peace%20of%20Amasya">Peace of Amasya</a> of 1555.

Upon ascending the throne, Ahmed I appointed <a href="Cigalazade%20Yusuf%20Sinan%20Pasha">Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha</a> as the commander of the eastern army. The army marched from Constantinople on 15 June 1604, which was too late, and by the time it had arrived on the eastern front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had captured <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> and entered the <a href="Kars%20Eyalet">Kars Eyalet</a>, and could only be stopped in <a href="Akhaltsikhe">Akhaltsikhe</a>. Despite the conditions being favourable, Sinan Pasha decided to stay for the winter in <a href="Van%2C%20Turkey">Van</a>, but then marched to <a href="Erzurum">Erzurum</a> to stop an incoming Safavid attack. This caused unrest within the army and the year was practically wasted for the Ottomans.

In 1605, Sinan Pasha marched to take <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, but the army was undermined by <a href="K%C3%B6se%20Sefer%20Pasha">Köse Sefer Pasha</a>, the <a href="Beylerbey">Beylerbey</a> of Erzurum, marching independently from Sinan Pasha and consequently being captured as a POW by the Safavids. The Ottoman army was routed <a href="Battle%20of%20Urmia%20%281604%29">Urmia</a> and had to flee firstly to Van and then to <a href="Diyarbak%C4%B1r">Diyarbekir</a>. Here, Sinan Pasha sparked a rebellion by executing the Beylerbey of <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, <a href="Canbulato%C4%9Flu%20H%C3%BCseyin%20Pasha">Canbulatoğlu Hüseyin Pasha</a>, who had come to provide help, upon the pretext that he had arrived too late. He soon died himself and the Safavid army was able to capture <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a>, <a href="Shirvan">Shirvan</a> and <a href="Shamakhi">Shamakhi</a> in Azerbaijan.

Grand Vizier <a href="Malko%C3%A7%20Ali%20Pasha">Malkoç Ali Pasha</a> marched to the western front from Constantinople on 3 June 1604 and arrived in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, but died there, so <a href="Lala%20Mehmed%20Pasha">Lala Mehmed Pasha</a> was appointed as the Grand Vizier and the commander of the western army. Under Mehmed Pasha, the western army recaptured <a href="Pest%2C%20Hungary">Pest</a> and <a href="V%C3%A1c">Vác</a>, but failed to capture <a href="Esztergom">Esztergom</a> as the siege was lifted due to unfavourable weather and the objections of the soldiers. Meanwhile, the Prince of <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Bocskay">Stephen Bocskay</a>, who struggled for the region's independence and had formerly supported the Habsburgs, sent a messenger to the Porte asking for help. Upon the promise of help, his forces also joined the Ottoman forces in Belgrade. With this help, the Ottoman army besieged Esztergom and captured it on 4 November 1605. Bocskai, with Ottoman help, captured <a href="Nov%C3%A9%20Z%C3%A1mky">Nové Zámky</a> (Uyvar) and forces under <a href="Tiryaki%20Hasan%20Pasha">Tiryaki Hasan Pasha</a> took <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m">Veszprém</a> and <a href="V%C3%A1rpalota">Palota</a>. <a href="Sarho%C5%9F%20%C4%B0brahim%20Pasha">Sarhoş İbrahim Pasha</a>, the Beylerbey of <a href="Nagykanizsa">Nagykanizsa</a> (Kanije), attacked the Austrian region of <a href="Istria">Istria</a>.

However, with Jelali revolts in Anatolia more dangerous than ever and a defeat in the eastern front, Mehmed Pasha was called to Constantinople. Mehmed Pasha suddenly died there, whilst preparing to leave for the east. <a href="Kuyucu%20Murad%20Pasha">Kuyucu Murad Pasha</a> then negotiated the <a href="Peace%20of%20Zsitvatorok">Peace of Zsitvatorok</a>, which abolished the tribute of 30,000 ducats paid by Austria and addressed the Habsburg emperor as the equal of the Ottoman sultan. The Jelali revolts were a strong factor in the Ottomans' acceptance of the terms. This signaled the end of Ottoman growth in Europe.

Resentment over the war with the Habsburgs and heavy taxation, along with the weakness of the Ottoman military response, combined to make the reign of Ahmed I the zenith of the <a href="Jelali%20revolts">Jelali revolts</a>. Tavil Ahmed launched a revolt soon after the coronation of Ahmed I and defeated <a href="Nasuh%20Pasha">Nasuh Pasha</a> and the Beylerbey of Anatolia, Kecdehan Ali Pasha. In 1605, Tavil Ahmed was offered the position of the Beylerbey of <a href="Shahrizor">Shahrizor</a> to stop his rebellion, but soon afterwards he went on to capture <a href="Harput">Harput</a>. His son, Mehmed, obtained the governorship of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> with a fake <a href="firman">firman</a> and defeated the forces of Nasuh Pasha sent to defeat him.

Meanwhile, Canbulatoğlu Ali Pasha united his forces with the <a href="Druze">Druze</a> Sheikh Ma'noğlu Fahreddin to defeat the Amir of <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a> Seyfoğlu Yusuf. He went on to take control of the <a href="Adana">Adana</a> area, forming an army and issuing coins. His forces routed the army of the newly appointed Beylerbey of Aleppo, Hüseyin Pasha. Grand Vizier <a href="Bo%C5%9Fnak%20Dervish%20Mehmed%20Pasha">Boşnak Dervish Mehmed Pasha</a> was executed for the weakness he showed against the Jelalis. He was replaced by Kuyucu Murad Pasha, who marched to Syria with his forces to defeat the 30,000-strong rebel army with great difficulty, albeit with a decisive result, on 24 October 1607. Meanwhile, he pretended to forgive the rebels in Anatolia and appointed the rebel Kalenderoğlu, who was active in <a href="Manisa">Manisa</a> and <a href="Bursa">Bursa</a>, as the <a href="sanjakbey">sanjakbey</a> of <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>. Baghdad was recaptured in 1607 as well. Canbulatoğlu Ali Pasha fled to Constantinople and asked for forgiveness from Ahmed I, who appointed him to <a href="Timi%C5%9Foara">Timişoara</a> and later Belgrade, but then executed him due to his misrule there. Meanwhile, Kalenderoğlu was not allowed in the city by the people of Ankara and rebelled again, only to be crushed by Murad Pasha's forces. Kalenderoğlu ended up fleeing to Persia. Murad Pasha then suppressed some smaller revolts in Central Anatolia and suppressed other Jelali chiefs by inviting them to join the army.

Due to the widespread violence of the Jelali revolts, a great number of people had fled their villages and a lot of villages were destroyed. Some military chiefs had claimed these abandoned villages as their property. This deprived the Porte of tax income and on 30 September 1609, Ahmed I issued a letter guaranteeing the rights of the villagers. He then worked on the resettlement of abandoned villages.

The new Grand Vizier, Nasuh Pasha, did not want to fight with the Safavids. The Safavid Shah also sent a letter saying that he was willing to sign a peace, with which he would have to send 200 loads of <a href="silk">silk</a> every year to Constantinople. On 20 November 1612, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nasuh%20Pasha">Treaty of Nasuh Pasha</a> was signed, which ceded all the lands the Ottoman Empire had gained in the war of 1578–90 back to Persia and reinstated the 1555 boundaries.

However, the peace ended in 1615 when the Shah did not send the 200 loads of silk. On 22 May 1615, Grand Vizier <a href="%C3%96k%C3%BCz%20Mehmed%20Pasha">Öküz Mehmed Pasha</a> was assigned to organize an attack on Persia. Mehmed Pasha delayed the attack till the next year, until when the Safavids made their preparations and attacked Ganja. In April 1616, Mehmed Pasha left Aleppo with a large army and marched to Yerevan, where he failed to take the city and withdrew to Erzurum. He was removed from his post and replaced by <a href="Damat%20Halil%20Pasha">Damat Halil Pasha</a>. Halil Pasha went for the winter to Diyarbekir, while the Khan of Crimea, <a href="Canibek%20Giray">Canibek Giray</a>, attacked the areas of <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja</a>, <a href="Nakhchivan%20%28city%29">Nakhichevan</a> and <a href="Julfa%2C%20Azerbaijan%20%28city%29">Julfa</a>.

Ahmed I renewed trade treaties with England, France and Venice. In July 1612, the first ever trade treaty with the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> was signed. He expanded the <a href="Capitulations%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">capitulations</a> given to France, specifying that merchants from <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Ragusa</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoa</a>, <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> and <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Tuscany">Florence</a> could trade under the French flag.

Sultan Ahmed constructed the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, the magnum opus of the Ottoman architecture, across from the Ayasofya mosque. The Sultan attended the breaking of the ground with a golden pickaxe to begin the construction of the mosque complex. An incident nearly broke out after the Sultan discovered that the Blue Mosque contained the same number of minarets as the grand mosque of Mecca. Sultan Ahmed became furious at this fault and became remorseful until the Shaykh-ul-Islam recommended that he should erect another Minaret at the grand mosque of Mecca and the matter was solved.

Sultan Ahmed became delightedly involved in the eleventh comprehensive renovations of the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>, which had just been damaged by flooding. He sent craftsmen from Constantinople, and the golden rain gutter that kept rain from collecting on the roof of the Ka’ba was successfully renewed. It was again during the era of Sultan Ahmed that an iron web was placed inside the <a href="Zamzam%20Well">Zamzam Well</a> in Mecca. The placement of this web about three feet below the water level was a response to lunatics who jumped into the well, imagining a promise of a heroic death.

In Medina, the city of the Prophet Muhammad, a new pulpit made of white marble and shipped from Istanbul arrived in the mosque of the Prophet and substituted the old, worn out pulpit. It is also known that Sultan Ahmed erected two more mosques in Uskudar on the Asian side of Istanbul; however neither of them have survived.

The Sultan had a crest carved with the footprint of the Prophet Muhammad that he would wear on Fridays and festive days and illustrated one of the most significant examples of affection to the prophet in Ottoman History. Engraved inside the crest was a poem he composed:

Sultan Ahmed was known for his skills in fencing, poetry, horseback riding, and fluency in several languages.

Ahmed was a poet who wrote a number of political and lyrical works under the name Bahti. But while supportive of poetry, he displayed an aversion to artistry and continued his father's neglect of <a href="Ottoman%20miniature">miniature painting</a>. This was connected to a devout religiosity that declared depiction of living things in art an immoral rivalry to <a href="Allah">Allah</a>'s creation. Accordingly, Ahmed patronized scholars, calligraphers, and pious men. Hence he commissioned a book entitled "The Quintessence of Histories" to be worked upon by calligraphers. He also attempted to enforce conformance to Islamic laws and traditions, restoring the old regulations that prohibited alcohol and he attempted to enforce attendance at <a href="Jumu%27ah">Friday prayers</a> and paying alms to the poor in the proper way.

He was responsible for the destruction of the musical clock organ that <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a> sent to the court during the reign of his father. The reason for this may have been Ahmed's religious objection to figurative art.

Ahmed II

Ahmed II (<a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>: احمد ثانى "Aḥmed-i sānī") (25 February 1643 – 6 February 1695) was the <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> from 1691 to 1695. Ahmed II was born at <a href="Topkap%C4%B1%20Palace">Topkapı Palace</a>, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, the son of Sultan <a href="Ibrahim%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ibrahim</a> (1640–48) by <a href="Muazzez%20Sultan">Muazzez Sultan</a>, and succeeded his brother <a href="Suleiman%20II">Suleiman II</a> (1687–91) in 1691.

Ahmed II was born on 25 February 1643, the son of Sultan <a href="Ibrahim%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Ibrahim</a> and <a href="Muazzez%20Sultan">Muazzez Sultan</a>. During the reigns of his older brothers, Ahmed was imprisoned in Kafes, and he stayed there almost 43 years.

During his short reign, Sultan Ahmed II devoted most of his attention to the wars against the Habsburgs and related foreign policy, governmental and economic issues. Of these, the most important were the tax reforms and the introduction of the lifelong tax farm system (malikane) (see <a href="tax%20farming">tax farming</a>). Following the recovery of Belgrade under his predecessor, <a href="Suleiman%20II">Suleiman II</a>, the military frontier reached a rough stalemate on the Danube, with the Habsburgs no longer able to advance south of it, and the Ottomans attempting, ultimately unsuccessfully, to regain the initiative north of it.

Among the most important features of Ahmed’s reign was his reliance on <a href="K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC%20Faz%C4%B1l%20Mustafa%20Pasha">Köprülüzade Fazıl Mustafa Pasha</a>. Following his accession to the throne, Sultan Ahmed II confirmed Köprülüzade Fazıl Mustafa Pasha in his office as grand vizier. In office from 1689, Fazıl Mustafa Pasha was from the famous Köprülü family of grand viziers, and like most of his Köprülü predecessors in the same office, was an able administrator and military commander. Like his father Köprülü Mehmed Pasha (grand vizier 1656–61) before him, he ordered the removal and execution of dozens of corrupt state officials of the previous regime and replaced them with men loyal to himself. He overhauled the tax system by adjusting it to the capabilities of the taxpayers affected by the latest wars. He also reformed troop mobilization and increased the pool of conscripts available for the army by drafting tribesmen in the Balkans and Anatolia. In October 1690 he recaptured Belgrade (northern Serbia), a key fortress that commanded the confluence of the rivers Danube and Sava; in Ottoman hands since 1521, the fortress had been conquered by the Habsburgs in 1688.

Fazıl Mustafa Pasha’s victory at Belgrade was a major military achievement that gave the Ottomans hope that the military debacles of the 1680s—which had led to the loss of Hungary and Transylvania, an Ottoman vassal principality ruled by pro-Istanbul Hungarian princes— could be reversed. However, Ottoman success proved ephemeral. On 19 August 1691, Fazıl Mustafa Pasha suffered a devastating defeat at Slankamen (northwest of Belgrade) at the hands of Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden, the Habsburg commander in chief in Hungary, fittingly nicknamed “Türkenlouis” (Louis the Turk) for his splendid victories against the Ottomans. In the confrontation, recognized by contemporaries as “the bloodiest battle of the century,” the Ottomans suffered heavy losses: 20,000 men, including the grand vizier. With him, the sultan lost his most capable military commander and the last member of the Köprülü family, who for the previous half century had been instrumental in strengthening the Ottoman military.

Under Fazıl Mustafa Pasha’s successors, the Ottomans suffered further defeats. In June 1692 the Habsburgs conquered Várad (Oradea, Romania), the seat of an Ottoman governor (beylerbeyi) since 1660. In 1694 they attempted to recapture Várad, but to no avail. On 12 January 1695, they surrendered the fortress of Gyula, the center of an Ottoman sancak or subprovince since 1566. With the fall of Gyula, the only territory still in Ottoman hands in Hungary was to the east of the River Tisza and to the south of the river Maros, with its center at Temesvár. Three weeks later, on 6 February 1695, Ahmed II died in <a href="Edirne%20Palace">Edirne Palace</a>.

Ahmed III

Ahmed III (<a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>: احمد ثالث, "Aḥmed-i sālis") (30/31 December 16731 July 1736) was <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and a son of Sultan <a href="Mehmed%20IV">Mehmed IV</a> (r. 1648–87). His mother was <a href="Emetullah%20Rabia%20G%C3%BClnu%C5%9F%20Sultan">Emetullah Rabia Gülnuş Sultan</a>, originally named Evmania Voria, who was an ethnic Greek. He was born at <a href="Dobrich">Hacıoğlu Pazarcık</a>, in <a href="Dobruja">Dobruja</a>. He succeeded to the throne in 1703 on the abdication of his brother <a href="Mustafa%20II">Mustafa II</a> (1695–1703). <a href="Nev%C5%9Fehirli%20Damat%20%C4%B0brahim%20Pasha">Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha</a> and the Sultan's daughter, <a href="Fatma%20Sultan%20%28daughter%20of%20Ahmed%20III%29">Fatma Sultan</a> (wife of the former) directed the government from 1718 to 1730, a period referred to as the "<a href="Tulip%20Era%20in%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Tulip Era</a>".

Ahmed III cultivated good relations with France, doubtless in view of <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Russia</a>'s menacing attitude. He afforded refuge in Ottoman territory to <a href="Charles%20XII%20of%20Sweden">Charles XII of Sweden</a> (1682–1718) after the Swedish defeat at the hands of <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter I of Russia</a> (1672–1725) in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poltava">Battle of Poltava</a> of 1709. In 1710 Charles XII convinced Sultan Ahmed III to declare war against Russia, and the Ottoman forces under <a href="Baltac%C4%B1%20Mehmet%20Pasha">Baltacı Mehmet Pasha</a> won a major victory at the <a href="Pruth%20River%20Campaign">Battle of Prut</a>. In the aftermath, Russia returned <a href="Azov">Azov</a> back to the Ottomans, agreed to demolish the fortress of <a href="Taganrog">Taganrog</a> and others in the area, and to stop interfering in the affairs of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>.

Forced against his will into war with Russia, Ahmed III came nearer than any Ottoman <a href="sovereign">sovereign</a> before or since to breaking the power of his northern rival, whose armies his <a href="grand%20vizier">grand vizier</a> <a href="Nev%C5%9Fehirli%20Damat%20%C4%B0brahim%20Pasha">Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha</a> succeeded in completely surrounding at the Pruth River Campaign in 1711. The subsequent Ottoman victories against Russia enabled the Ottoman Empire to advance to Moscow, had the Sultan wished. However, this was halted as a report reached <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> that the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavids</a> were invading the Ottoman Empire, causing a period of panic, turning the Sultan's attention away from Russia.

Sultan Ahmed III had become unpopular by reason of the excessive pomp and costly luxury in which he and his principal officers indulged; on September 20, 1730, a mutinous riot of seventeen <a href="Janissaries">Janissaries</a>, led by the <a href="Albanians">Albanian</a> <a href="Patrona%20Halil">Patrona Halil</a>, was aided by the citizens as well as the military until it swelled into an insurrection in front of which the Sultan was forced to give up the throne.

Ahmed voluntarily led his nephew <a href="Mahmud%20I">Mahmud I</a> (1730–54) to the seat of sovereignty and paid allegiance to him as Sultan of the Empire. He then retired to the <a href="Kafes">Kafes</a> previously occupied by Mahmud and died at <a href="Topkap%C4%B1%20Palace">Topkapı Palace</a> after six years of confinement.

The reign of Ahmed III lasted for twenty-seven years and was not unsuccessful. The recovery of <a href="Azov">Azov</a> and the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>, and the conquest of part of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, managed to counterbalance the <a href="Balkans">Balkan</a> territory ceded to the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a> through the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Passarowitz">Treaty of Passarowitz</a>, after the Ottoman Empire was defeated in <a href="Austro-Turkish%20War%20of%201716%E2%80%9318">Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18</a>. In 1716, he sent an army of 33,000 men to capture <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> from the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> but that expedition eventually failed,

Ahmed III left the finances of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in a flourishing condition, which had remarkably been obtained without excessive taxation or extortion procedures. He was a cultivated <a href="Patronage">patron</a> of literature and art, and it was in his time that the first <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a> authorized to use the Arabic or Turkish languages was set up in Istanbul, operated by <a href="Ibrahim%20Muteferrika">Ibrahim Muteferrika</a> (while the printing press had been introduced to Constantinople in 1480, all works published before 1729 were in Greek, Armenian, or Hebrew).

It was in this reign that an important change in the government of the <a href="Danubian%20Principalities">Danubian Principalities</a> was introduced: previously, the <a href="Ottoman%20Porte">Porte</a> had appointed <a href="Hospodar">Hospodar</a>s, usually native <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>n and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>n <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s, to administer those provinces; after the <a href="Pruth%20River%20Campaign">Russian campaign</a> of 1711, during which <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> found an ally in <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Moldavia">Prince</a> <a href="Dimitrie%20Cantemir">Dimitrie Cantemir</a>, the Porte began overtly deputizing <a href="Phanariotes">Phanariote</a> <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> in that region, and extended the system to <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> after <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Wallachia">Prince</a> <a href="Stefan%20Cantacuzino">Stefan Cantacuzino</a> established links with <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Eugene of Savoy</a>. The Phanariotes constituted a kind of "<a href="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a>" nobility, which supplied the Porte with functionaries in many important departments of the state.

In the year 1712, the <a href="Mughal%20Emperor">Mughal Emperor</a> <a href="Jahandar%20Shah">Jahandar Shah</a>, a grandson of <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a> sent gifts to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="Ahmad%20III">Ahmad III</a> and referred to himself as the Ottoman Sultan's devoted admirer.

The <a href="Mughal%20Emperor">Mughal Emperor</a> <a href="Farrukhsiyar">Farrukhsiyar</a> a grandson of <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a>, is also known to have sent a letter to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a> but this time it was received by the <a href="Grand%20Vizier">Grand Vizier</a> <a href="Nev%C5%9Fehirli%20Damad%20Ibrahim%20Pasha">Nevşehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha</a> providing a graphic description of the efforts of the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> commander <a href="Sayyid%20Brothers">Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha</a> against the <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> and <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> rebellion.


• Şehzade Musa (5 January 1696 - 26 May 1730):
• Şehzade suleiman


In <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "<a href="Candide">Candide</a>", the eponymous main character meets the deposed Ahmed III on a ship from <a href="Venice">Venice</a> to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. The Sultan is in the company of five other deposed European monarchs, and he tells Candide, who initially doubts his credentials:

I am not jesting, my name is Achmet III. For several years I was Sultan; I dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me; they cut off the heads of my viziers; I am ending my days in the old seraglio; my nephew, Sultan Mahmoud, sometimes allows me to travel for my health, and I have come to spend the Carnival at Venice." <a href="https%3A//archive.org/stream/candideotherroma00voltuoft/candideotherroma00voltuoft_djvu.txt"></a>

This episode was taken up by the modern Turkish writer <a href="Nedim%20G%C3%BCrsel">Nedim Gürsel</a> as the setting of his 2001 novel "Le voyage de Candide à Istanbul".

In fact, there is no evidence of the deposed Sultan being allowed to make such foreign travels, nor did Voltaire (or Gürsel) assert that it had any actual historical foundation.

Ainu people

The Ainu or the Aynu (<a href="Ainu%20language">Ainu</a> <a href="Katakana">アィヌ</a> <a href="Latin%20alphabet">"Aynu"</a>; Japanese: "<a href="Romanization%20of%20Japanese">Ainu</a>"; Russian: "<a href="ISO%209">Ajny</a>"), in the historical Japanese texts Ezo () or Ainu (), are an <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous people</a> of Japan (<a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, and formerly <a href="T%C5%8Dhoku%20region">northeastern</a> <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>) and Russia (<a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>, the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> and formerly the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>).

The official number of the Ainu is 25,000, but unofficially is estimated at 200,000 due to many Ainu having been completely assimilated into Japanese society and, as a result, having no knowledge of their ancestry.

Recent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the <a href="Okhotsk%20culture">Okhotsk</a> and <a href="Satsumon%20culture">Satsumon</a> cultures. In 1264, Ainu invaded the land of <a href="Nivkh%20people">Nivkh people</a> controlled by the <a href="Yuan%20Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a> of Mongolia, resulting in battles between Ainu and the Chinese. Active contact between the <a href="Yamato%20people">Wajin</a> (the ethnically Japanese) and the Ainu of <a href="Ezo">Ezo</a>chi (now known as <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>) began in the 13th century. The Ainu formed a society of hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by hunting and fishing. They followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena.

During the <a href="Muromachi%20period">Muromachi period</a> (1336–1573), the disputes between the Japanese and Ainu developed into a war. <a href="Takeda%20Nobuhiro">Takeda Nobuhiro</a> killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain. Many Ainu were subject to Japanese rule which led to a violent Ainu revolt such as <a href="Koshamain%27s%20Revolt">Koshamain's Revolt</a> () in 1456.

During the <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> (1601–1868) the Ainu, who controlled the northern island which is now named Hokkaido, became increasingly involved in trade with the Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island. The <a href="Tokugawa%20bakufu">Tokugawa bakufu</a> (feudal government) granted the <a href="Matsumae%20clan">Matsumae clan</a> exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period the Ainu became increasingly dependent on goods imported by the Japanese, and were suffering from epidemic diseases such as <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>.
Although the increased contact created by the trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent Ainu revolts. The most important was <a href="Shakushain%27s%20Revolt">Shakushain's Revolt</a> (1669–1672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the <a href="Menashi-Kunashir%20Battle">Menashi-Kunashir Battle</a> in 1789.

In the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu. In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaido, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.

"<a href="Metropolitan%20%28free%20magazine%29">Metropolitan</a>" magazine reported, "Many Ainu were forced to work, essentially as slaves, for <a href="Yamato%20people">Wajin</a> (ethnic Japanese), resulting in the breakup of families and the introduction of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a>, cholera, and <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> into their community. In 1869, the new Meiji government renamed Ezo as Hokkaido and unilaterally incorporated it into Japan. It banned the Ainu language, took Ainu land away, and prohibited salmon fishing and deer hunting."

The beginning of the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political, and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaido. Sjöberg quotes Baba's (1980) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:
" … The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia. Second … it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class … Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy."
In 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as "former aborigines", with the idea they would assimilate—this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control. Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.
The Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land—over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese. In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wajin who had decided to move to Hokkaido, encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island's abundant natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of Western industrial agriculture. While at the time, the process was openly referred to as colonization ("takushoku" 拓殖), the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage "kaitaku" (開拓), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands. As well as this, factories such as flour mills, beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904. During this time, the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.

The 1899 act mentioned above was replaced in 1997—until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups. It was not until June 6, 2008, that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see <a href="%23Official%20recognition%20in%20Japan">Official Recognition</a>, below).

The vast majority of these Wajin men are believed to have compelled Ainu women into partnering with them as local wives. Intermarriage between Japanese and Ainu was actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, <a href="Oki%20%28musician%29">Oki</a>, born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument "<a href="tonkori">tonkori</a>". There are also many small towns in the southeastern or <a href="Hidaka%20Subprefecture">Hidaka</a> region where ethnic Ainu live such as in <a href="Nibutani">Nibutani</a> (<a href="Ainu%20language">Ainu</a>: "Niputay"). Many live in <a href="Sambutsu">Sambutsu</a> especially, on the eastern coast. In 1966 the number of "pure" Ainu was about 300.

Their most widely known <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> is derived from the word "ainu", which means "human" (particularly as opposed to "kamui", divine beings), basically neither ethnicity nor the name of a race, in the Hokkaido dialects of the <a href="Ainu%20language">Ainu language</a>. Ainu is the word Ainu identify themselves as from their first male ancestor Aioina; Ainu means "human" in the Ainu language. Ainu also identify themselves as "Utari" ("comrade" in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.

On June 6, 2008, the <a href="Japanese%20Diet">Japanese Diet</a> passed a bipartisan, non-binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous to Japan</a>, and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognised the Ainu people as "an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture". The government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition, stating, "The government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many Ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization, despite being legally equal to (Japanese) people."

As a result of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint%20Petersburg%20%281875%29">Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875)</a>, the Kuril Islands – along with their Ainu inhabitants – came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in <a href="Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky">Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky</a> on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a>. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in <a href="Ust-Bolsheretsky%20District">Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion</a>. As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the <a href="Kamchadals">Kamchadal</a> community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.
, the North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye form the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side), the smallest group, numbers just six people residing in <a href="Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky">Petropavlovsk</a>. On Sakhalin island, a few dozen people identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese-Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan.) Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent live in Khabarovsk. There is no evidence of living descendants of the Kamchatka Ainu.

In the <a href="Russian%20Census%20%282010%29">2010 Census of Russia</a>, close to 100 people tried to register themselves as ethnic Ainu in the village, but the governing council of Kamchatka Krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic Kamchadal. In 2011, the <a href="leadership">leader</a> of the Ainu community in Kamchatka, Alexei Vladimirovich Nakamura, requested that Vladimir Ilyukhin (Governor of Kamchatka) and Boris Nevzorov (Chairman of the State Duma) include the Ainu in the central list of the <a href="Indigenous%20small-numbered%20peoples%20of%20the%20North%2C%20Siberia%20and%20the%20Far%20East">Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East</a>. This request was also turned down.

Ethnic Ainu living in <a href="Sakhalin%20Oblast">Sakhalin Oblast</a> and <a href="Khabarovsk%20Krai">Khabarovsk Krai</a> are not organized politically. According to Alexei Nakamura, only 205 Ainu live in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals (<a href="Itelmens">Itelmen</a> of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition. Since the Ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in Russia, they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic Russians or Kamchadal.

The Ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the <a href="Kuril%20islands">Kuril islands</a> and that the Japanese and Russians were both invaders. In 2004, the small <a href="Ainu%20in%20Russia">Ainu community living in Russia</a> in Kamchatka Krai wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to reconsider any move to award the <a href="Kuril%20Islands%20dispute">Southern Kuril Islands</a> to Japan. In the letter they blamed the Japanese, the Tsarist Russians and the Soviets for crimes against the Ainu such as killings and assimilation, and also urged him to recognize the Japanese genocide against the Ainu people, which was turned down by Putin.

The Ainu have often been considered to descend from the <a href="J%C5%8Dmon%20period">Jōmon people</a>, who lived in Japan from the Jōmon period. One of their "<a href="Yukar">Yukar</a> Upopo", or legends, tells that "The Ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came".

Recent research suggests that the historical Ainu culture originated in a merger of the <a href="Okhotsk%20culture">Okhotsk culture</a> with the Satsumon, one of the ancient archaeological cultures that are considered to have derived from the Jōmon period cultures of the Japanese Archipelago. Their economy was based on farming, as well as hunting, fishing and gathering.

Full-blooded Ainu, compared to people of <a href="Yamato%20people">Yamato</a> descent, often have lighter skin and more body hair. Many early investigators proposed a <a href="Caucasian%20race">Caucasian</a> ancestry, although recent DNA tests have not shown any genetic similarity with modern Europeans. Cavalli-Sforza places the Ainu in his "<a href="Northeast%20Asia">Northeast</a> and <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>n" genetic cluster.

Anthropologist Joseph Powell of the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a> wrote "...we follow Brace and Hunt (1990) and Turner (1990) in viewing the Ainu as a southeast Asian population derived from early Jomon peoples of Japan, who have their closest biological affinity with south Asians rather than western Eurasia peoples".

<a href="Mark%20J.%20Hudson">Mark J. Hudson</a>, Professor of Anthropology at <a href="Nishikyushu%20University">Nishikyushu University</a>, <a href="Kanzaki%2C%20Saga">Kanzaki, Saga</a>, Japan, said Japan was settled by a "Proto-Mongoloid" population in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> who became the Jōmon and their features can be seen in the Ainu and <a href="Ryukyuans">Okinawan</a> people.

In 1893, anthropologist <a href="Arnold%20Henry%20Savage%20Landor">Arnold Henry Savage Landor</a> described the Ainu as having deep-set eyes and an eye shape typical of Europeans, with a large and prominent browridge, large ears, hairy and prone to <a href="baldness">baldness</a>, slightly flattened hook nose with large and broad nostrils, prominent cheek bones, large mouth and thick lips and a long region from nose to mouth and small chin region.

Omoto has also shown that the Ainu are Mongoloid, and not Caucasoid, on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology.

Turner found remains of Jōmon people of Japan to belong to <a href="Sinodonty%20and%20Sundadonty">Sundadont</a> pattern similar with the Southern Mongoloid living populations of Taiwanese aborigines, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Indonesians, Thais, Borneans, Laotians, and Malaysians. A recreation of a map made by William W. Howells, professor of anthropology at Harvard University, the shaded are the remnants and populations of non-Mongoloid people, appearing as N (Negrito) or A (Australoids of Wallacea, Melanesia and Australia). The latter peoples comprise the present aboriginals of Australia and Melanesia, as shown; the interest here is their presence and remnants. 'Sundadonts' comprise Southeast Asiatics and offshore peoples from northern Japan (Ainu) down to Taiwan and Indonesia. '<a href="Sinodont">Sinodont</a>' comprises the East Asian populations from Korea, Japan, China, Mongolia and Siberia.

Ainu men have abundant wavy hair and often have long beards. The book of "Ainu Life and Legends" by author Kyōsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains the physical description of Ainu: "Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them."

Genetic testing has shown them to belong mainly to <a href="Haplogroup%20D-M55">Y-haplogroup D-M55</a>. Y-DNA haplogroup D1b is found frequently throughout the <a href="Japanese%20Archipelago">Japanese Archipelago</a> including <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. The only places outside Japan in which Y-haplogroup D is common are <a href="Tibet%20Autonomous%20Region">Tibet</a> in China and the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> in the Indian Ocean.
In a study by Tajima "et al." (2004), two out of a sample of sixteen (or 12.5%) Ainu men have been found to belong to <a href="Haplogroup%20C-M217%20%28Y-DNA%29">Haplogroup C-M217</a>, which is the most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. Hammer "et al." (2006) have tested a sample of four Ainu men and have found that one of them belongs to haplogroup C-M217. Some researchers have speculated that this minority of Haplogroup C-M217 carriers among the Ainu may reflect a certain degree of unidirectional genetic influence from the <a href="Nivkhs">Nivkhs</a>, a traditionally nomadic people of northern Sakhalin and the adjacent mainland, with whom the Ainu have long-standing cultural interactions.

Based on analysis of one sample of 51 modern Ainus, their mtDNA lineages have been reported to consist mainly of <a href="haplogroup%20Y%20%28mtDNA%29">haplogroup Y</a> (11/51 = 21.6% according to Tanaka "et al." 2004, or 10/51 = 19.6% according to Adachi "et al." 2009, who have cited Tajima "et al." 2004), <a href="haplogroup%20D%20%28mtDNA%29">haplogroup D</a> (9/51 = 17.6%, particularly D4(xD1)), <a href="haplogroup%20M%20%28mtDNA%29">haplogroup M7a</a> (8/51 = 15.7%), and <a href="haplogroup%20G%20%28mtDNA%29">haplogroup G1</a> (8/51 = 15.7%). Other mtDNA haplogroups detected in this sample include <a href="haplogroup%20A%20%28mtDNA%29">A</a> (2/51), <a href="haplogroup%20M%20%28mtDNA%29">M7b2</a> (2/51), <a href="haplogroup%20N%20%28mtDNA%29">N9b</a> (1/51), <a href="haplogroup%20B%20%28mtDNA%29">B4f</a> (1/51), <a href="haplogroup%20F%20%28mtDNA%29">F1b</a> (1/51), and <a href="haplogroup%20M%20%28mtDNA%29">M9a</a> (1/51). Most of the remaining individuals in this sample have been classified definitively only as belonging to macro-<a href="haplogroup%20M%20%28mtDNA%29">haplogroup M</a>. According to Sato "et al." (2009), who have studied the mtDNA of the same sample of modern Ainus (n=51), the major haplogroups of the Ainu are N9 (14/51 = 27.5%, including 10/51 Y and 4/51 N9(xY)), D (12/51 = 23.5%, including 8/51 D(xD5) and 4/51 D5), M7 (10/51 = 19.6%), and G (10/51 = 19.6%, including 8/51 G1 and 2/51 G2); the minor haplogroups are A (2/51), B (1/51), F (1/51), and M(xM7, M8, CZ, D, G) (1/51). Studies published in 2004 and 2007 show the combined frequency of M7a and N9b were observed in Jomons and which are believed by some to be Jomon maternal contribution at 28% in Okinawans (7/50 M7a1, 6/50 M7a(xM7a1), 1/50 N9b), 17.6% in Ainus (8/51 M7a(xM7a1), 1/51 N9b), and from 10% (97/1312 M7a(xM7a1), 1/1312 M7a1, 28/1312 N9b) to 17% (15/100 M7a1, 2/100 M7a(xM7a1)) in mainstream Japanese.

A recent reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the Jōmon. This agrees with the reference to the Ainu being a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. A recent genetic study by Choongwon Jeong, Shigeki Nakagome, and Anna Di Rienzo, published in 2015, has revealed that the Ainu's closest human relatives are the <a href="Itelmen">Itelmen</a>, <a href="Chukchi%20people">Chukchi</a>, <a href="Koryaks">Koryak</a>, <a href="Yakuts">Yakut</a>, and <a href="Nivkh%20people">Nivkh</a> peoples of Northeast Siberia who live around the lands surrounding the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>.

The Ainu were distributed in the northern and central islands of Japan, from Sakhalin island in the north to the Kuril Islands and the island of Hokkaido and Northern Honshū, although some investigators place their former range as throughout Honshū. Others place them as far north as the southern tip of the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a> in what is now <a href="Cape%20Lopatka">Cape Lopatka</a>. The island of Hokkaido was known to the Ainu as Ainu Moshir, and was formally annexed by the Japanese at the late date of 1868, partly as a means of preventing the intrusion of the Russians, and partly for imperialist reasons.
According to the <a href="Russian%20Empire%20Census">Russian Empire Census</a> of 1897, 1,446 persons in the Russian Empire reported Ainu language as their mother tongue, 1,434 of them in Sakhalin Island.

The southern half of Sakhalin was acquired by Japan as a result of the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05, but at the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviets <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria%20%281945%29">declared war on Japan</a> and took possession of the Kuril islands and southern Sakhalin. The Ainu population, as previously Japanese subjects, were "repatriated" to Japan.

During Tsarist times, the Ainu living in Russia were forbidden from identifying themselves as such, since Imperial Japanese officials claimed that all the regions inhabited by the Ainu in the past or present belonged to Japan. The terms "Kurile", "Kamchatka Kurile", etc., were used to identify the ethnic group. During Soviet times, people with Ainu surnames were sent to gulags and labor camps, as they were often mistaken for Japanese. As a result, large numbers of Ainu changed their surnames to Slavic ones. After World War II, most of the Ainu living in Sakhalin were deported to Japan. Of the 1,159 Ainu, only around 100 remained in Russia. Of those who remained, only the elderly were full-blooded Ainu. Others were either mixed race or married to ethnic Russians. The last of the Ainu households disappeared in the late 1960s, when Yamanaka Kitaro killed himself after the death of his wife. The couple was childless. To eradicate Ainu identity, Soviet authorities removed the ethnic group from the list of nationalities which could be mentioned in a Soviet passport. Due to this, children born after 1945 were not able to identify themselves as Ainu. The last known deportation of Ainu to Japan occurred in 1982, when Keizo Nakamura, a full blooded Northern Kuril Ainu, was deported to Hokkaido after serving 15 years' hard labor in the province of <a href="Magadan%20Oblast">Magadan</a>. His wife, Tamara Timofeevna Pikhteevoi, was of mixed Sakhalin Ainu and Gilyak ancestry. After the arrest of Keizo in 1967, Tamara and her son Alexei Nakamura were expelled from Kamchatka Krai and sent to the island of Sakhalin, to live in the city of <a href="Tomari%2C%20Russia">Tomari</a>. 

Unlike the other Ainu clans currently living in Russia, there is considerable doubt whether the Nakamura clan of Kamchatka should be identified as Northern Kuril Ainu, Southern Kuril Ainu or as Kamchatka Ainu. This is due to the fact that the clan originally immigrated to Kamchatka from <a href="Kunashir">Kunashir</a> in 1789. The Ainu of Kunashir are South Kuril Ainu. They settled down near <a href="Kurile%20Lake">Kurile Lake</a>, which was inhabited by the Kamchatka Ainu and North Kuril Ainu. In 1929 the Ainu of <a href="Kurile%20Lake">Kurile Lake</a> fled to the island of <a href="Paramushir">Paramushir</a> after an armed conflict with the Soviet authorities. At that time, Paramushir was under Japanese rule. During the <a href="Invasion%20of%20the%20Kuril%20Islands">Invasion of the Kuril Islands</a>, Akira Nakamura (b. 1897) was captured by the Soviet army and his elder son Takeshi Nakamura (1925–45) was killed in the battle. Akira's only surviving son, Keizo (b. 1927), was taken prisoner and joined the Soviet Army after his capture. After the war, Keizo went to <a href="Korsakov%20%28town%29">Korsakov</a> to work in the local harbor. In 1963 he married Tamara Pikhtivoi, a member of the Sakhalin Ainu tribe. Their only child Alexei was born in 1964. The descendants of Tamara and Alexei are found in Kamchatka and Sakhalin.

In 1979 the USSR removed the term "Ainu" from the list of "living" ethnic groups of Russia, an act by which the government proclaimed that the Ainu as an ethnic group were extinct in its territory. According to the 2002 Russian Federation census, no respondents gave the ethnonym Ainu in boxes 7 or 9.2 in the K-1 form of the census, though some still might exist. During the 2010 Census of Russia, the authorities rejected the claim from a group of mostly mixed race Ainu living in Kamchatka that they were not extinct.

The only Ainu speakers remaining (besides perhaps a few partial speakers) live solely in Japan. There, they are concentrated primarily on the southern and eastern coasts of the island of Hokkaido.

Due to intermarriage with the Japanese and ongoing absorption into the predominant culture, there are no truly Ainu settlements existing in Japan today. The town of <a href="Nibutani">Nibutani</a> (<a href="Ainu%20language">Ainu</a>: "Niputay") in Hidaka area (Hokkaido prefecture) has a number of Ainu households and a visit to some of the Ainu owned craft shops close to the Ainu museums (there are two of them in Nibutani) is an opportunity to interact with the Ainu people. Many "authentic Ainu villages" advertised in Hokkaido such as <a href="Akan%2C%20Hokkaido">Akan</a> and <a href="Shiraoi%2C%20Hokkaido">Shiraoi</a> are tourist attractions and provide an opportunity to see and meet Ainu people.

Today, it is estimated that fewer than 100 speakers of the language remain, while other research places the number at fewer than 15 speakers. The language has been classified as "endangered". As a result of this the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.

Although there have been attempts to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected that the relationship goes beyond contact, such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu. In fact, no attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and Ainu is currently considered to be a <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a>.

Words used as prepositions in English (such as "to", "from", "by", "in", and "at") are postpositional in Ainu; they come after the word that they modify. A single sentence in Ainu can be made up of many added or <a href="agglutinate">agglutinate</a>d sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.

The Ainu language has had no system of writing, and has historically been transliterated by the Japanese <a href="kana">kana</a> or <a href="Russian%20alphabet">Russian Cyrillic</a>. Today, it is typically written in either <a href="katakana">katakana</a> or <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. The unwieldy nature of the Japanese kana with its inability to accurately represent <a href="syllable%20coda">coda</a> consonants has contributed to the degradation of the original Ainu. For example, some words, such as "Kor" (meaning "to hold"), are now pronounced with a terminal vowel sound, as in "Koro".

Many of the Ainu dialects, even from one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not mutually intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the <a href="Yukar">Yukar</a>, or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.

Traditional Ainu culture was quite different from <a href="Culture%20of%20Japan">Japanese culture</a>. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full <a href="beard">beard</a>s and <a href="moustache">moustache</a>s. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a>ed their mouths, and sometimes the <a href="forearm">forearm</a>s. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional <a href="Clothing">dress</a> was a robe spun from the inner bark of the <a href="elm">elm</a> tree, called "attusi" or "attush". Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.

Modern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a beaded necklace called a <a href="tamasay">tamasay</a>.

Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of <a href="bear%20meat">bear</a>, fox, <a href="wolf">wolf</a>, <a href="badger">badger</a>, <a href="ox">ox</a>, or <a href="horse%20meat">horse</a>, as well as fish, <a href="fowl">fowl</a>, <a href="millet">millet</a>, vegetables, herbs, and <a href="root">root</a>s. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.

Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed.

Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves ("<a href="Iris%20pseudacorus">Iris pseudacorus</a>"; and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used <a href="chopstick">chopstick</a>s when eating; the women had wooden <a href="spoon">spoon</a>s. <a href="Ainu%20cuisine">Ainu cuisine</a> is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; there are only a few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.

The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. <a href="Corporal%20punishment">Beating</a> was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the <a href="Hamstringing">tendons of his feet severed</a>.

The Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, <a href="plant%20gathering">plant gathering</a>, salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered.

A village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory.

The Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of <a href="sika%20deer">sika deer</a>), rabbit, fox, <a href="raccoon%20dog">raccoon dog</a>, and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu, as were <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. They also hunted <a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>s such as <a href="white-tailed%20sea%20eagle">white-tailed sea eagle</a>s, <a href="raven">raven</a> and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese.

The Ainu hunted with <a href="arrow">arrow</a>s and <a href="spear">spear</a>s with poison-coated points. They obtained the <a href="poison">poison</a>, called "<a href="surku">surku</a>", from the roots and stalks of <a href="aconitum">aconites</a>. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo, Matsumomushi, tobacco and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers.

They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, for animals like bear in particular, they prayed to the <a href="Kamuy%20Fuchi">god of fire</a> and the house guardian god to convey their wishes for a large catch, and safe hunting to the god of mountains.

The Ainu usually hunted bear during the time of the spring thaw. At that time, bears were weak because they had not fed at all during long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an "amappo". The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.

Men wore a <a href="crown%20%28headgear%29">crown</a> called "sapanpe" for important ceremonies. "Sapanpe" was made from wood fibre with bundles of partially shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its centre. Men carried an "emush" (ceremonial sword) secured by an "emush at" strap to their shoulders.

Women wore "matanpushi", embroidered headbands, and "ninkari", earrings. "Ninkari" was a metal ring with a ball. Women wore it through a hole in the ear. "Matanpushi" and "ninkari" were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called "maidari" now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore "maidari". Women sometimes wore a bracelet called "tekunkani".

Women wore a necklace called "rektunpe", a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a "<a href="tamasay">tamasay</a>" or "shitoki", usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the <a href="Matsumae%20clan">Matsumae clan</a>.

A village is called a "kotan" in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. A village consisted basically of a paternal <a href="clan">clan</a>. The average number of families was four to seven, rarely reaching more than ten. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.

"Cise" or "cisey" (houses) in a kotan were made of <a href="cogon%20grasses">cogon grasses</a>, <a href="bamboo%20grass">bamboo grass</a>, <a href="bark">bark</a>s, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the "rorun-puyar," a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called "shiso") . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called "harkiso"). The house had a platform for valuables called "iyoykir" behind the shiso. The Ainu placed "sintoko" (hokai) and "ikayop" (quivers) there.

Outbuildings included separate lavatories for men called "ashinru" and for women called "menokoru", a "pu" (storehouse) for food, a "heper set" (cage for young bear), and drying-racks for fish and wild plants. An altar ("nusasan") faced the east side of the house ("rorunpuyar"). The Ainu held such ceremonies there as "<a href="Iyomante">Iyomante</a>", a ceremony to send the spirit of a bear to the gods.
The Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called "tunpu" annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.

The age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women, who were <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a>ed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.

When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, leggings and other handmade clothes. According to some books, many "yomeiri" marriages, in which a bride went to the house of a bridegroom with her belongings to become a member of his family, were conducted in the old days.

For a "yomeiri" marriage, a man and his father would bring betrothal gifts to the house of a woman, including a sword, a treasured sword, an ornamental quiver, a sword guard, and a woven basket ("hokai"). If the man and woman agreed to marry, the man and his father would bring her to their house or the man would stay at her house for a while and then bring her to his house. At the wedding ceremony, participants prayed to the god of fire. Bride and bridegroom respectively ate half of the rice served in a bowl, and other participants were entertained.

The worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a <a href="decoction">decoction</a> of the endodermis of <a href="alder">alder</a> and the roots of <a href="butterburs">butterburs</a> to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as "attush", until coming of age.

Newborn babies were named "ayay" (a baby's crying), "shipo", "poyshi" (small excrement), "shion" (old excrement). Children were called by these "temporary" names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning "excrement" or "old things" to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behaviour or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.

Men wore <a href="loincloth">loincloth</a>s and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15–16. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15–16. They wore underclothes called "mour" and had their hair dressed properly and wound <a href="waistcloth">waistcloth</a>s called "raunkut" and "ponkut" around their bodies. When women reached age 12–13, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 15–16, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.

The Ainu are traditionally <a href="animists">animists</a>, believing that everything in nature has a "<a href="kamuy">kamuy</a>" (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include <a href="Kamuy%20Fuchi">Kamuy Fuchi</a>, goddess of the hearth, <a href="Kim-un%20Kamuy">Kim-un Kamuy</a>, god of bears and mountains, and <a href="Repun%20Kamuy">Repun Kamuy</a>, god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals.

The Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making <a href="libation">libation</a>s of <a href="sake">sake</a>, uttering <a href="prayers">prayers</a>, and offering <a href="willow">willow</a> sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called "<a href="inaw">inaw</a>" (singular) and "nusa" (plural).

They are placed on an altar used to "send back" the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called "<a href="Iyomante">Iyomante</a>". The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of <a href="Illness">sickness</a>. They believe their spirits are <a href="Immortality">immortal</a>, and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to "kamuy mosir" (Land of the Gods).

The Ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice "arctolatry" or <a href="bear%20worship">bear worship</a>. The Ainu believe the bear is very special because they think the bear is Kim-un Kamuy's way of delivering the gift of bear hide and meat to humans.

Ainu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted <a href="Buddhism%20in%20Japan">Buddhism</a> and <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a>, while some northern Ainu are members of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>.

Most Hokkaido Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the <a href="Hokkaido%20Utari%20Association">Hokkaido Utari Association</a>. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese <a href="nation-state">nation-state</a>. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.

Other key institutions include "The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC)", set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaido University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers. Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.

On March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the <a href="Saru%20River">Saru River</a> watershed in southern Hokkaido. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan. The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to <a href="Nibutani">Nibutani</a> village, the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history. In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and <a href="Shigeru%20Kayano">Kayano Shigeru</a>—well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community. After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaido Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaido Development Bureau.

The final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons—the dam was already standing—but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders.</ref> The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wajin in the case and discussions about the case. The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act—the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years. While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the <a href="Saru%20River">Sarugawa River</a> resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an <a href="Cultural%20Landscapes%20of%20Japan">Important Cultural Landscape</a>. A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.

Much national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as in Japanese. One such committee operated in the late 1990s, and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law. This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.

More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included. It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.

The was founded on January 21, 2012, after a group of Ainu activists in Hokkaido announced the formation of a political party for the Ainu on October 30, 2011. The Ainu Association of Hokkaido reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a <a href="Multiculturalism">multicultural</a> and <a href="Polyethnicity">multiethnic</a> society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.

The Ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government as well as people since contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaido into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaido in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had a 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaido as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide ¥7 million beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.

Acropolis

An acropolis ([ancient Greek]]: ἀκρόπολις, "Akrópolis"; from "ákros" (άκρος) or "ákron" (άκρον) "highest, topmost, outermost" and "pólis" "city"; plural in English: "acropoles", "acropoleis" or "acropolises") is a <a href="Human%20settlement">settlement</a>, especially a <a href="citadel">citadel</a>, built upon an area of elevated ground—frequently a hill with <a href="precipice">precipitous</a> sides, chosen for purposes of defense. In many parts of the world, acropoleis became the nuclei of large cities of <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, such as <a href="ancient%20Rome">ancient Rome</a>, and for this reason they are sometimes prominent landmarks in modern cities with ancient pasts, such as modern <a href="Rome">Rome</a>.

The word "acropolis" literally means in Greek "upper city," and though associated primarily with the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> cities <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Argos">Argos</a> ( with <a href="Larissa%20%28Argos%29">Larissa</a>), <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a> (with <a href="Cadmea">Cadmea</a>), and <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a> (with its <a href="Acrocorinth">Acrocorinth</a>), may be applied generically to all such citadels, including Rome, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, Celtic <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, many in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, or even <a href="Castle%20Rock%2C%20Edinburgh">Castle Rock</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.

Acropolis is also the term used by archaeologists and historians for the urban <a href="Castro%20culture">Castro culture</a> settlements located in Northwestern Iberian hilltops.

The most famous example is the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis of Athens</a>, which, by reason of its historical associations and the several famous buildings erected upon it (most notably the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>), is known without qualification as "the Acropolis".

Acupuncture

Acupuncture is a form of <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a> in which thin needles are inserted into the body. It is a key component of <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> (TCM). TCM theory and practice are not based upon <a href="scientific%20knowledge">scientific knowledge</a>, and acupuncture is a <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>. There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country. The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the United States. It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions. Acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.
The conclusions of many trials and numerous <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent. An overview of <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane reviews</a> found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions. A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain. The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the <a href="Placebo">placebo effect</a>. A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. A <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was <a href="cost-effective">cost-effective</a> as an adjunct to standard care, while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.

Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean needle technique and single-use needles. When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor <a href="adverse%20effects">adverse effects</a>. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect of the practitioner. A review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade. The most frequently reported adverse events were <a href="pneumothorax">pneumothorax</a> and infections. Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.
Scientific investigation has not found any <a href="histology">histological</a> or <a href="physiology">physiological</a> evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as "<a href="qi">qi</a>", <a href="meridian%20%28Chinese%20medicine%29">meridians</a>, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy ("qi") flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems. Acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100 BC in China, around the time "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine" (<a href="Huangdi%20Neijing">Huangdi Neijing</a>) was published, though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. Over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a> energies, and a body's "rhythm" on the effectiveness of treatment. Acupuncture grew and diminished in popularity in China repeatedly, depending on the country's political leadership and the favor of rationalism or Western medicine. Acupuncture spread first to Korea in the 6th century AD, then to Japan through medical missionaries, and then to Europe, starting with France. In the 20th century, as it spread to the United States and Western countries, the spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflict with Western beliefs were abandoned in favor of tapping needles into nerves.

Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine. It is commonly used for pain relief, though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. The majority of people who seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems, including <a href="low%20back%20pain">low back pain</a>, shoulder stiffness, and knee pain. Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment. For example, <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Anesthesiologists">American Society of Anesthesiologists</a> states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.

Acupuncture is the insertion of thin needles into the skin. According to the <a href="Mayo%20Foundation%20for%20Medical%20Education%20and%20Research">Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research</a> (Mayo Clinic), a typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes. It can be associated with the application of heat, pressure, or <a href="laser%20light">laser light</a>. Classically, acupuncture is individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on scientific research. There is also a <a href="invasiveness%20of%20surgical%20procedures%23Non-invasive%20procedure">non-invasive</a> therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of "needles" for the treatment of children ("shōnishin" or "shōnihari").

Clinical practice varies depending on the country. A comparison of the average number of patients treated per hour found significant differences between China (10) and the United States (1.2). <a href="Chinese%20herbs">Chinese herbs</a> are often used. There is a diverse range of acupuncture approaches, involving different philosophies. Although various different techniques of acupuncture practice have emerged, the method used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) seems to be the most widely adopted in the US. Traditional acupuncture involves needle insertion, <a href="moxibustion">moxibustion</a>, and <a href="cupping%20therapy">cupping therapy</a>, and may be accompanied by other procedures such as feeling the <a href="Radial%20pulse">pulse</a> and other parts of the body and examining the tongue. Traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a "life force" ("<a href="qi">qi</a>") circulates within the body in lines called meridians. The main methods practiced in the UK are TCM and Western medical acupuncture. The term Western medical acupuncture is used to indicate an adaptation of TCM-based acupuncture which focuses less on TCM. The Western medical acupuncture approach involves using acupuncture after a medical diagnosis. Limited research has compared the contrasting acupuncture systems used in various countries for determining different acupuncture points and thus there is no defined standard for acupuncture points.

In traditional acupuncture, the acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, auscultation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge. Auscultation and olfaction involves listening for particular sounds such as wheezing, and observing body odor. Inquiring involves focusing on the "seven inquiries": chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and <a href="menses">menses</a> and <a href="leukorrhea">leukorrhea</a>. Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender ""A-shi"" points and feeling the pulse.

The most common mechanism of stimulation of acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture). Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking. Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination. Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications. Needles vary in length between , with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0 to 0, with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles. Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). Korean acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.

The skin is sterilized and needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended. Often the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called "de qi", as well as "needle grasp," a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin. Acupuncture can be painful. The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.

"De-qi" (; "arrival of qi") refers to a sensation of <a href="paresthesia">numbness</a>, distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding <a href="Meridian%20%28Chinese%20medicine%29">meridian</a>. If "de-qi" can not be generated, then inaccurate location of the <a href="acupoint">acupoint</a>, improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient can be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the "de-qi" sensation does not immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as "plucking", "shaking" or "trembling").

Once "de-qi" is achieved, further techniques might be utilized which aim to "influence" the "de-qi"; for example, by certain manipulation the "de-qi" sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body. Other techniques aim at "tonifying" () or "sedating" () "qi". The former techniques are used in <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20medicine%23Basic%20principles%20of%20pattern%20discrimination">deficiency</a> patterns, the latter in excess patterns. "De qi" is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.

It is difficult but not impossible to design rigorous research trials for acupuncture. Due to acupuncture's invasive nature, one of the major challenges in <a href="Efficacy%23Medicine">efficacy</a> research is in the design of an appropriate placebo <a href="control%20group">control group</a>. For efficacy studies to determine whether acupuncture has specific effects, "sham" forms of acupuncture where the patient, practitioner, and analyst are <a href="Blind%20experiment">blinded</a> seem the most acceptable approach. Sham acupuncture uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points, e.g. inserting needles on meridians not related to the specific condition being studied, or in places not associated with meridians. The under-performance of acupuncture in such trials may indicate that therapeutic effects are due entirely to non-specific effects, or that the sham treatments are not inert, or that systematic protocols yield less than optimal treatment.

A 2014 <a href="review%20article">review</a> in "<a href="Nature%20Reviews%20Cancer">Nature Reviews Cancer</a>" found that "contrary to the claimed mechanism of redirecting the flow of "qi" through meridians, researchers usually find that it generally does not matter where the needles are inserted, how often (that is, no dose-response effect is observed), or even if needles are actually inserted. In other words, 'sham' or 'placebo' acupuncture generally produces the same effects as 'real' acupuncture and, in some cases, does better." A 2013 meta-analysis found little evidence that the effectiveness of acupuncture on pain (compared to sham) was modified by the location of the needles, the number of needles used, the experience or technique of the practitioner, or by the circumstances of the sessions. The same analysis also suggested that the number of needles and sessions is important, as greater numbers improved the outcomes of acupuncture compared to non-acupuncture controls. There has been little systematic investigation of which components of an acupuncture session may be important for any therapeutic effect, including needle placement and depth, type and intensity of stimulation, and number of needles used. The research seems to suggest that needles do not need to stimulate the traditionally specified acupuncture points or penetrate the skin to attain an anticipated effect (e.g. psychosocial factors).

A response to "sham" acupuncture in osteoarthritis may be used in the elderly, but placebos have usually been regarded as deception and thus unethical. However, some physicians and ethicists have suggested circumstances for applicable uses for placebos such as it might present a theoretical advantage of an inexpensive treatment without adverse reactions or interactions with drugs or other medications. As the evidence for most types of alternative medicine such as acupuncture is far from strong, the use of alternative medicine in regular healthcare can present an ethical question.

Using the principles of <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> to research acupuncture is controversial, and has produced different results. Some research suggests acupuncture can alleviate pain but the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo. Evidence suggests that any benefits of acupuncture are short-lasting. There is insufficient evidence to support use of acupuncture compared to <a href="medicine">mainstream medical treatments</a>. Acupuncture is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term.

<a href="Publication%20bias">Publication bias</a> is cited as a concern in the reviews of <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>s (RCTs) of acupuncture. A 1998 review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture, as were ten out of eleven studies conducted in Russia. A 2011 assessment of the quality of RCTs on TCM, including acupuncture, concluded that the methodological quality of most such trials (including randomization, experimental control, and blinding) was generally poor, particularly for trials published in Chinese journals (though the quality of acupuncture trials was better than the trials testing TCM remedies). The study also found that trials published in non-Chinese journals tended to be of higher quality. Chinese authors use more Chinese studies, which have been demonstrated to be uniformly positive. A 2012 review of 88 systematic reviews of acupuncture published in Chinese journals found that less than half of these reviews reported testing for publication bias, and that the majority of these reviews were published in journals with <a href="impact%20factor">impact factor</a>s of zero.

Scientist and journalist <a href="Steven%20Salzberg">Steven Salzberg</a> identifies acupuncture and Chinese medicine generally as a focus for "fake medical journals" such as the <a href="Journal%20of%20Acupuncture%20and%20Meridian%20Studies">Journal of Acupuncture and Meridian Studies</a> and <a href="Acupuncture%20in%20Medicine">Acupuncture in Medicine</a>.

The conclusions of many trials and numerous <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>s of acupuncture are largely inconsistent with each other. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture, and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain. The same review found that neck pain was one of only four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested, but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias. A 2009 overview of <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane review</a>s found acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions.

A 2014 systematic review suggests that the <a href="nocebo%20effect">nocebo effect</a> of acupuncture is clinically relevant and that the rate of adverse events may be a gauge of the nocebo effect. According to the 2014 "<a href="Miller%27s%20Anesthesia">Miller's Anesthesia</a>" book, "when compared with placebo, acupuncture treatment has proven efficacy for relieving pain". A 2012 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> conducted by the Acupuncture Trialists' Collaboration found "relatively modest" efficiency of acupuncture (in comparison to sham) for the treatment of four different types of <a href="chronic%20pain">chronic pain</a> (back and neck pain, knee osteoarthritis, chronic headache, and shoulder pain) and on that basis concluded that it "is more than a placebo" and a reasonable referral option. Commenting on this meta-analysis, both <a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> and <a href="David%20Colquhoun">David Colquhoun</a> said the results were of negligible clinical significance. Edzard Ernst later stated that "I fear that, once we manage to eliminate this bias [that operators are not blind] … we might find that the effects of acupuncture exclusively are a placebo response."

A 2010 systematic review suggested that acupuncture is more than a placebo for commonly occurring chronic pain conditions, but the authors acknowledged that it is still unknown if the overall benefit is clinically meaningful or cost-effective. A 2010 review found real acupuncture and sham acupuncture produce similar improvements, which can only be accepted as evidence against the efficacy of acupuncture. The same review found limited evidence that real acupuncture and sham acupuncture appear to produce biological differences despite similar effects. A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis found that acupuncture had a small analgesic effect, which appeared to lack any clinical importance and could not be discerned from bias. The same review found that it remains unclear whether acupuncture reduces pain independent of a psychological impact of the needling ritual. A 2016 Cochrane review found moderate quality evidence that real acupuncture was more effective than sham acupuncture or inactive treatment for short-term relief of neck pain measured either upon completion of treatment or at short-term follow-up. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that ear acupuncture may be effective at reducing pain within 48 hours of its use, but the <a href="mean%20difference">mean difference</a> between the acupuncture and control groups was small and that "Rigorous research is needed to establish definitive evidence".

A 2013 systematic review found that acupuncture may be effective for nonspecific lower back pain, but the authors noted there were limitations in the studies examined, such as heterogeneity in study characteristics and low methodological quality in many studies. A 2012 systematic review found some supporting evidence that acupuncture was more effective than no treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain; the evidence was conflicting comparing the effectiveness over other treatment approaches. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews found that "for chronic low back pain, individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a toothpick that does not penetrate the skin." A 2010 review found that sham acupuncture was as effective as real acupuncture for chronic low back pain. The specific therapeutic effects of acupuncture were small, whereas its clinically relevant benefits were mostly due to contextual and psychosocial circumstances. Brain imaging studies have shown that traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture differ in their effect on limbic structures, while at the same time showed equivalent analgesic effects. A 2005 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either acupuncture or <a href="dry%20needling">dry needling</a> for acute low back pain. The same review found low quality evidence for pain relief and improvement compared to no treatment or sham therapy for chronic low back pain only in the short term immediately after treatment. The same review also found that acupuncture is not more effective than conventional therapy and other alternative medicine treatments. A 2017 systematic review for an <a href="American%20College%20of%20Physicians">American College of Physicians</a> clinical practice guideline found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture was effective for chronic low back pain, and limited evidence that it was effective for acute low back pain. The same review found that the strength of the evidence for both conditions was low to moderate. Another 2017 clinical practice guideline, this one produced by the <a href="Danish%20Health%20Authority">Danish Health Authority</a>, recommended against acupuncture for both recent-onset low back pain and <a href="lumbar%20radiculopathy">lumbar radiculopathy</a>.

Two separate 2016 Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture could be useful in the prophylaxis of tension-type headaches and episodic <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s. The 2016 Cochrane review evaluating acupuncture for episodic migraine prevention concluded that true acupuncture had a small effect beyond sham acupuncture and found moderate-quality evidence to suggest that acupuncture is at least similarly effective to prophylactic medications for this purpose. A 2012 review found that acupuncture has demonstrated benefit for the treatment of headaches, but that safety needed to be more fully documented in order to make any strong recommendations in support of its use.

A 2014 review concluded that "current evidence supports the use of acupuncture as an alternative to traditional analgesics in osteoarthritis patients." , a meta-analysis showed that acupuncture may help <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> pain but it was noted that the effects were insignificant in comparison to sham needles. A 2013 systematic review and network meta-analysis found that the evidence suggests that acupuncture may be considered one of the more effective physical treatments for alleviating pain due to knee osteoarthritis in the short-term compared to other relevant physical treatments, though much of the evidence in the topic is of poor quality and there is uncertainty about the efficacy of many of the treatments. A 2012 review found "the potential beneficial action of acupuncture on osteoarthritis pain does not appear to be clinically relevant." A 2010 Cochrane review found that acupuncture shows <a href="Statistical%20significance">statistically significant</a> benefit over sham acupuncture in the treatment of peripheral joint osteoarthritis; however, these benefits were found to be so small that their <a href="clinical%20significance">clinical significance</a> was doubtful, and "probably due at least partially to placebo effects from incomplete blinding".

A 2013 Cochrane review found low to moderate evidence that acupuncture improves pain and stiffness in treating people with <a href="fibromyalgia">fibromyalgia</a> compared with no treatment and standard care. A 2012 review found "there is insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture for the treatment of fibromyalgia." A 2010 systematic review found a small pain relief effect that was not apparently discernible from bias; acupuncture is not a recommendable treatment for the management of fibromyalgia on the basis of this review.

A 2012 review found that the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> is "sparse and inconclusive." A 2005 Cochrane review concluded that acupuncture use to treat rheumatoid arthritis "has no effect on <a href="Erythrocyte%20sedimentation%20rate">ESR</a>, <a href="C-reactive%20protein">CRP</a>, pain, patient's global assessment, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, general health, disease activity and reduction of analgesics." A 2010 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture in the treatment of most rheumatic conditions, with the exceptions of osteoarthritis, low back pain, and lateral elbow pain.

A 2014 systematic review found that although manual acupuncture was effective at relieving short-term pain when used to treat <a href="tennis%20elbow">tennis elbow</a>, its long-term effect in relieving pain was "unremarkable". A 2007 review found that acupuncture was significantly better than sham acupuncture at treating chronic knee pain; the evidence was not conclusive due to the lack of large, high-quality trials.

A 2014 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for <a href="postoperative%20nausea%20and%20vomiting">postoperative nausea and vomiting</a> (PONV) in a clinical setting. A 2013 systematic review concluded that acupuncture might be beneficial in prevention and treatment of PONV. A 2009 Cochrane review found that stimulation of the P6 acupoint on the wrist was as effective (or ineffective) as <a href="antiemetic">antiemetic</a> drugs and was associated with minimal side effects. The same review found "no reliable evidence for differences in risks of postoperative nausea or vomiting after P6 acupoint stimulation compared to antiemetic drugs."

A 2014 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to suggest that acupuncture is effective for surgical or <a href="post-operative">post-operative</a> pain. For the use of acupuncture for post-operative pain, there was contradictory evidence. A 2014 systematic review found supportive but limited evidence for use of acupuncture for acute post-operative pain after back surgery. A 2014 systematic review found that while the evidence suggested acupuncture could be an effective treatment for postoperative <a href="gastroparesis">gastroparesis</a>, a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality.

A 2015 Cochrane review found that there is insufficient evidence to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for cancer pain in adults. A 2014 systematic review published in the Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine found that acupuncture may be effective as an adjunctive treatment to palliative care for cancer patients. A 2013 overview of reviews published in the Journal of Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer found evidence that acupuncture could be beneficial for people with cancer-related symptoms, but also identified few rigorous trials and high heterogeneity between trials. A 2012 systematic review of randomised clinical trials published in the same journal found that the number and quality of RCTs for using acupuncture in the treatment of <a href="cancer%20pain">cancer pain</a> was too low to draw definite conclusions.

A 2014 systematic review reached inconclusive results with regard to the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating cancer-related fatigue. A 2013 systematic review found that acupuncture is an acceptable adjunctive treatment for <a href="chemotherapy-induced%20nausea%20and%20vomiting">chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</a>, but that further research with a low risk of bias is needed. A 2013 systematic review found that the quantity and quality of available RCTs for analysis were too low to draw valid conclusions for the effectiveness of acupuncture for <a href="cancer-related%20fatigue">cancer-related fatigue</a>.

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that acupuncture was "associated with a significant reduction in sleep disturbances in women experiencing <a href="menopause">menopause</a>-related sleep disturbances."

A 2010 overview of systematic reviews found that moxibustion was effective for several conditions but the primary studies were of poor quality, so there persists ample uncertainty, which limits the conclusiveness of their findings.

Acupuncture is generally safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles. When improperly delivered it can cause adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect on the part of the practitioner. To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after acupuncture, acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently. People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for acupuncture. <a href="Contraindication">Contraindication</a>s to acupuncture (conditions that should not be treated with acupuncture) include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. hemophilia and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns). Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).

A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture continue to be reported. Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of <a href="serious%20adverse%20event">serious adverse event</a>s, including five <a href="deaths">deaths</a>, were reported. Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to <a href="Medical%20malpractice">malpractice</a> of acupuncturists. This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately-trained acupuncturists. Most such reports originate from Asia, which may reflect the large number of treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists. Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries. These included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less under-reporting in the UK than other countries. Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma. The most frequent adverse events included <a href="pneumothorax">pneumothorax</a>, and <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial</a> and <a href="viral%20infection">viral infection</a>s.

A 2013 review found (without restrictions regarding publication date, study type or language) 295 cases of infections; <a href="mycobacterium">mycobacterium</a> was the <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> in at least 96%. Likely sources of infection include towels, hot packs or boiling tank water, and reusing reprocessed needles. Possible sources of infection include contaminated needles, reusing personal needles, a person's skin containing mycobacterium, and reusing needles at various sites in the same person. Although acupuncture is generally considered a safe procedure, a 2013 review stated that the reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the prior decade, including those of mycobacterium. Although it is recommended that practitioners of acupuncture use disposable needles, the reuse of sterilized needles is still permitted. It is also recommended that thorough control practices for preventing infection be implemented and adapted.

A 2013 systematic review of the English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of <a href="spinal%20cord%20injuries">spinal cord injuries</a> (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five <a href="heart">heart</a> injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand <a href="edema">edema</a>, <a href="granuloma">epithelioid granuloma</a>, <a href="pseudolymphoma">pseudolymphoma</a>, <a href="argyria">argyria</a>, pustules, <a href="pancytopenia">pancytopenia</a>, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.

A 2013 systematic review found 31 cases of vascular injuries caused by acupuncture, three resulting in death. Two died from pericardial tamponade and one was from an aortoduodenal fistula. The same review found vascular injuries were rare, bleeding and pseudoaneurysm were most prevalent. A 2011 systematic review (without restriction in time or language), aiming to summarize all reported case of <a href="cardiac%20tamponade">cardiac tamponade</a> after acupuncture, found 26 cases resulting in 14 deaths, with little doubt about <a href="causality">causality</a> in most fatal instances. The same review concluded cardiac tamponade was a serious, usually fatal, though theoretically avoidable complication following acupuncture, and urged training to minimize risk.

A 2012 review found a number of adverse events were reported after acupuncture in the UK's <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">National Health Service</a> (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners should know, and be prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments. Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe. However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).

Acupuncture seems to be safe in people getting <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a>s, assuming needles are used at the correct location and depth. Studies are required to verify these findings. The evidence suggests that acupuncture might be a safe option for people with allergic rhinitis.

A 2010 systematic review of the Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, <a href="subarachnoid%20hemorrhage">subarachnoid hemorrhage</a>, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, most of which were due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. <a href="Prospective%20survey">Prospective survey</a>s show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidences</a> among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a>, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.

A causal link between acupuncture and the adverse events cardiac arrest, pyknolepsy, shock, fever, cough, thirst, aphonia, leg numbness, and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain. The same review concluded that acupuncture can be considered inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated there is a need to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks. Between 1999 and 2010, the Republic of Korean-literature contained reports of 1104 adverse events. Between the 1980s and 2002, the Japanese-language literature contained reports of 150 adverse events.

Although acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years in China, its use in <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a> in the United States did not become common until the early 2000s. In 2007, the <a href="National%20Health%20Interview%20Survey">National Health Interview Survey</a> (NHIS) conducted by the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Health%20Statistics">National Center For Health Statistics</a> (NCHS) estimated that approximately 150,000 children had received acupuncture treatment for a variety of conditions.

In 2008 a study determined that the use of acupuncture-needle treatment on children was "questionable" due to the possibility of adverse side-effects and the pain manifestation differences in children versus adults. The study also includes warnings against practicing acupuncture on infants, as well as on children who are over-fatigued, very weak, or have over-eaten.

When used on children, acupuncture is considered safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture. The same review found 279 adverse events, 25 of them serious. The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding). The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients. On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. <a href="cardiac%20rupture">cardiac rupture</a> or <a href="hemoptysis">hemoptysis</a>); many might have been a result of substandard practice. The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.

When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events. The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding. Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality. Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.
Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the <a href="abdomen">abdominal region</a>, should be avoided during pregnancy.

Four adverse events associated with moxibustion were bruising, burns and cellulitis, spinal epidural abscess, and large superficial basal cell carcinoma. Ten adverse events were associated with cupping. The minor ones were <a href="keloid">keloid</a> scarring, burns, and <a href="bulla%20%28dermatology%29">bullae</a>; the serious ones were acquired hemophilia A, stroke following cupping on the back and neck, factitious <a href="panniculitis">panniculitis</a>, reversible cardiac hypertrophy, and <a href="iron%20deficiency%20anemia">iron deficiency anemia</a>.

A 2013 meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was <a href="cost-effective">cost-effective</a> as a complement to standard care, but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented. The same meta-analysis found there was no difference between sham and non-sham acupuncture. A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain. A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture could not be concluded. A 2012 review found that acupuncture seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.

As with other alternative medicines, unethical or naïve practitioners may induce patients to exhaust financial resources by pursuing ineffective treatment. Professional ethics codes set by accrediting organizations such as the <a href="National%20Certification%20Commission%20for%20Acupuncture%20and%20Oriental%20Medicine">National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine</a> require practitioners to make "timely referrals to other health care professionals as may be appropriate." <a href="Stephen%20Barrett">Stephen Barrett</a> states that there is a "risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition".

Acupuncture is a substantial part of <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> (TCM). Early acupuncture beliefs relied on concepts that are common in TCM, such as a life force energy called "qi". "Qi" was believed to flow from the body's primary organs (<a href="zang-fu">zang-fu</a> organs) to the "superficial" body tissues of the skin, muscles, tendons, bones, and joints, through channels called meridians. Acupuncture points where needles are inserted are mainly (but not always) found at locations along the meridians. Acupuncture points not found along a meridian are called extraordinary points and those with no designated site are called "A-shi" points.

In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in energies such as <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20medicine%23Yin%20and%20yang">yin, yang</a>, <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20medicine%23TCM%20model%20of%20the%20body">"qi", xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians</a>, and of the interaction between the body and the environment. Therapy is based on which "pattern of disharmony" can be identified. For example, some diseases are believed to be caused by meridians being invaded with an excess of wind, cold, and damp. In order to determine which <a href="Traditional%20chinese%20medicine%23Patterns">pattern</a> is at hand, practitioners examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing, or the sound of the voice. TCM and its concept of disease does not strongly differentiate between the cause and effect of symptoms.

Scientific research has not supported the existence of "qi", meridians, or yin and yang. A "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" editorial described TCM as "fraught with pseudoscience", with the majority of its treatments having no logical <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a>. <a href="Quackwatch">Quackwatch</a> states that "TCM theory and practice are not based upon the body of knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. TCM practitioners disagree among themselves about how to diagnose patients and which treatments should go with which diagnoses. Even if they could agree, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care."

Some modern practitioners support the use of acupuncture to treat pain, but have abandoned the use of "qi", meridians, "yin", "yang" and other energies based in mysticism as explanatory frameworks. The use of "qi" as an explanatory framework has been decreasing in China, even as it becomes more prominent during discussions of acupuncture in the US. Academic discussions of acupuncture still make reference to pseudoscientific concepts such as "qi" and meridians despite the lack of scientific evidence. Many within the <a href="scientific%20community">scientific community</a> consider attempts to rationalize acupuncture in science to be <a href="quackery">quackery</a>, pseudoscience and "theatrical placebo". Academics <a href="Massimo%20Pigliucci">Massimo Pigliucci</a> and <a href="Maarten%20Boudry">Maarten Boudry</a> describe it as a "borderlands science" lying between science and pseudoscience.

Many acupuncturists attribute pain relief to the release of <a href="endorphins">endorphins</a> when needles penetrate, but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease. It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals, but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either acupuncture points or meridians. Human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive.

Some studies suggest acupuncture causes a series of events within the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>, and that it is possible to inhibit acupuncture's analgesic effects with the opioid antagonist <a href="naloxone">naloxone</a>. Mechanical deformation of the skin by acupuncture needles appears to result in the release of <a href="adenosine">adenosine</a>. The <a href="Nociception">anti-nociceptive</a> effect of acupuncture may be mediated by the <a href="adenosine%20A1%20receptor">adenosine A1 receptor</a>. A 2014 review in "Nature Reviews Cancer" found that since the key mouse studies that suggested acupuncture relieves pain via the local release of adenosine, which then triggered nearby A1 receptors "caused more tissue damage and inflammation relative to the size of the animal in mice than in humans, such studies unnecessarily muddled a finding that local inflammation can result in the local release of adenosine with analgesic effect."

It has been proposed that acupuncture's effects in <a href="gastrointestinal%20disorder">gastrointestinal disorder</a>s may relate to its effects on the <a href="parasympathetic%20nervous%20system">parasympathetic</a> and <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>, which have been said to be the "Western medicine" equivalent of "yin and yang". Another mechanism whereby acupuncture may be effective for gastrointestinal dysfunction involves the promotion of gastric peristalsis in subjects with low initial gastric motility, and suppressing peristalsis in subjects with active initial motility. Acupuncture has also been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects, which may be mediated by the activation of the <a href="vagus%20nerve">vagus nerve</a> and deactivation of inflammatory <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s. <a href="Neuroimaging">Neuroimaging</a> studies suggest that acupuncture stimulation results in deactivation of the limbic brain areas and the <a href="default%20mode%20network">default mode network</a>.

Acupuncture, along with moxibustion, is one of the oldest practices of traditional Chinese medicine. Most historians believe the practice began in China, though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated. Academics David Ramey and Paul Buell said the exact date acupuncture was founded depends on the extent dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes acupuncture.

According to an article in "Rheumatology", the first documentation of an "organized system of diagnosis and treatment" for acupuncture was in "The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine" (<a href="Huangdi%20Neijing">Huangdi Neijing</a>) from about 100 BC. Gold and silver needles found in the tomb of <a href="Liu%20Sheng%2C%20Prince%20of%20Zhongshan">Liu Sheng</a> from around 100 BC are believed to be the earliest archeological evidence of acupuncture, though it is unclear if that was their purpose. According to Dr. Plinio Prioreschi, the earliest known historical record of acupuncture is the <a href="Shih-Chi">Shih-Chi</a> ("Record of History"), written by a historian around 100 BC. It is believed that this text was documenting what was established practice at that time.

The 5,000-year-old mummified body of <a href="%C3%96tzi%20the%20Iceman">Ötzi the Iceman</a> was found with 15 groups of tattoos, many of which were located at points on the body where acupuncture needles are used for abdominal or lower back problems. Evidence from the body suggests Otzi suffered from these conditions. This has been cited as evidence that practices similar to acupuncture may have been practiced elsewhere in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> during the early <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>; however, "The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine" calls this theory "speculative". It is considered unlikely that acupuncture was practiced before 2000 BC. The Ötzi the Iceman's tattoo marks suggest to some experts that an acupuncture-like treatment was previously used in Europe 5 millennia ago.

Acupuncture may have been practiced during the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, near the end of the <a href="stone%20age">stone age</a>, using sharpened stones called <a href="Bian%20Stones">Bian shi</a>. Many Chinese texts from later eras refer to sharp stones called "plen", which means "stone probe", that may have been used for acupuncture purposes. The ancient Chinese medical text, Huangdi Neijing, indicates that sharp stones were believed at-the-time to cure illnesses at or near the body's surface, perhaps because of the short depth a stone could penetrate. However, it is more likely that stones were used for other medical purposes, such as puncturing a growth to drain its <a href="pus">pus</a>. The "<a href="Mawangdui">Mawangdui</a>" texts, which are believed to be from the 2nd century BC, mention the use of pointed stones to open <a href="abscess">abscess</a>es, and moxibustion, but not for acupuncture. It is also speculated that these stones may have been used for bloodletting, due to the ancient Chinese belief that illnesses were caused by demons within the body that could be killed or released. It is likely bloodletting was an antecedent to acupuncture.

According to historians <a href="Lu%20Gwei-djen">Lu Gwei-djen</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Needham">Joseph Needham</a>, there is substantial evidence that acupuncture may have begun around 600 BC. Some hieroglyphs and <a href="Pictogram">pictographs</a> from that era suggests acupuncture and moxibustion were practiced. However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period. It is possible <a href="Bronze">Bronze</a> was used for early acupuncture needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to have been used in fewer cases. If acupuncture was practiced during the <a href="Shang%20dynasty">Shang dynasty</a> (1766 to 1122 BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used. Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles. Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for acupuncture and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes. An article in "Rheumatology" said that the absence of any mention of acupuncture in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198 BC suggest that acupuncture was not practiced by that time.

Several different and sometimes conflicting belief systems emerged regarding acupuncture. This may have been the result of competing schools of thought. Some ancient texts referred to using acupuncture to cause bleeding, while others mixed the ideas of blood-letting and spiritual ch'i energy. Over time, the focus shifted from blood to the concept of puncturing specific points on the body, and eventually to balancing Yin and Yang energies as well. According to Dr. David Ramey, no single "method or theory" was ever predominantly adopted as the standard. At the time, scientific knowledge of medicine was not yet developed, especially because in China dissection of the deceased was forbidden, preventing the development of basic anatomical knowledge.

It is not certain when specific acupuncture points were introduced, but the autobiography of Pien Chhio from around 400–500 BC references inserting needles at designated areas. <a href="Bian%20Que">Bian Que</a> believed there was a single acupuncture point at the top of one's skull that he called the point "of the hundred meetings." Texts dated to be from 156–186 BC document early beliefs in channels of life force energy called meridians that would later be an element in early acupuncture beliefs.

Ramey and Buell said the "practice and theoretical underpinnings" of modern acupuncture were introduced in "The Yellow Emperor's Classic" (Huangdi Neijing) around 100 BC. It introduced the concept of using acupuncture to manipulate the flow of life energy ("qi") in a network of meridian (channels) in the body. The network concept was made up of acu-tracts, such as a line down the arms, where it said acupoints were located. Some of the sites acupuncturists use needles at today still have the same names as those given to them by the "Yellow Emperor's Classic". Numerous additional documents were published over the centuries introducing new acupoints. By the 4th century AD, most of the acupuncture sites in use today had been named and identified.

In the first half of the 1st century AD, acupuncturists began promoting the belief that acupuncture's effectiveness was influenced by the time of day or night, the lunar cycle, and the season. The Science of the Yin-Yang Cycles ("Yün Chhi Hsüeh") was a set of beliefs that curing diseases relied on the alignment of both heavenly (thien) and earthly (ti) forces that were attuned to cycles like that of the sun and moon. There were several different belief systems that relied on a number of celestial and earthly bodies or elements that rotated and only became aligned at certain times. According to Needham and Gwei-djen, these "arbitrary predictions" were depicted by acupuncturists in complex charts and through a set of special terminology.

Acupuncture needles during this period were much thicker than most modern ones and often resulted in infection. Infection is caused by a lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the wrong time. Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a <a href="cauterizing">cauterizing</a> effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the "Chen Chiu Ta Chheng" from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.

Other belief systems were based on the idea that the human body operated on a rhythm and acupuncture had to be applied at the right point in the rhythm to be effective. In some cases a lack of balance between Yin and Yang were believed to be the cause of disease.

In the 1st century AD, many of the first books about acupuncture were published and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The "Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing", which was published in the mid-3rd century, became the oldest acupuncture book that is still in existence in the modern era. Other books like the "Yu Kuei Chen Ching", written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved. In the mid 7th century, <a href="Sun%20Simiao">Sun Simiao</a> published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding acupuncture sites on people of different sizes and categorized acupuncture sites in a set of modules.

Acupuncture became more established in China as improvements in paper led to the publication of more acupuncture books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported acupuncture, became more established and created medical colleges in every province. The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists. By time "The Great Compendium of Acupuncture and Moxibustion" was published during the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> (1368–1644 AD), most of the acupuncture practices used in the modern era had been established.

By the end of the Song dynasty (1279 AD), acupuncture had lost much of its status in China. It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious professions like <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, <a href="shamanism">shamanism</a>, <a href="midwifery">midwifery</a> and moxibustion. Additionally, by the 18th century, scientific rationality was becoming more popular than traditional superstitious beliefs. By 1757 a book documenting the history of Chinese medicine called acupuncture a "lost art". Its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.

In 1822, the Chinese Emperor signed a decree excluding the practice of acupuncture from the Imperial Medical Institute. He said it was unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars. In China acupuncture was increasingly associated with lower-class, illiterate practitioners. It was restored for a time, but banned again in 1929 in favor of science-based Western medicine. Although acupuncture declined in China during this time period, it was also growing in popularity in other countries.

Korea is believed to be the first country in Asia that acupuncture spread to outside of China. Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by emperor <a href="Dangun">Dangun</a>, though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture in 514 AD. Acupuncture use was commonplace in Korea by the 6th century. It spread to Vietnam in the 8th and 9th centuries. As Vietnam began trading with Japan and China around the 9th century, it was influenced by their acupuncture practices as well. China and Korea sent "medical missionaries" that spread traditional Chinese medicine to Japan, starting around 219 AD. In 553, several Korean and Chinese citizens were appointed to re-organize medical education in Japan and they incorporated acupuncture as part of that system. Japan later sent students back to China and established acupuncture as one of five divisions of the Chinese State Medical Administration System.

Acupuncture began to spread to Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> met Japanese and Chinese acupuncture practitioners and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it. He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term "acupuncture" in his 1683 work "De Acupunctura". France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century. The French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>) is usually credited with being the first to experiment with the procedure in Europe in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.

By the 19th century, acupuncture had become commonplace in many areas of the world. Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century. Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, <a href="pulse%20diagnosis">pulse diagnosis</a>, and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves. In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the flow of electricity in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.

The West eventually created a belief system based on Travell trigger points that were believed to inhibit pain. They were in the same locations as China's spiritually identified acupuncture points, but under a different nomenclature. The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by <a href="Willem%20ten%20Rhijne">Willem ten Rhijne</a>.

In China, the popularity of acupuncture rebounded in 1949 when <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a> took power and sought to unite China behind traditional cultural values. It was also during this time that many Eastern medical practices were consolidated under the name traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

New practices were adopted in the 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles, electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted for up to a week. A lot of emphasis developed on using acupuncture on the ear. Acupuncture research organizations were founded in the 1950s and acupuncture services became available in modern hospitals. China, where acupuncture was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine. Meanwhile, acupuncture grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) declared support for acupuncture for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Integrative%20Health">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a> was created within the NIH. Acupuncture became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.

Politicians from the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Chinese Communist Party</a> said acupuncture was superstitious and conflicted with the party's commitment to science. Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong later reversed this position, arguing that the practice was based on scientific principles.

In 1971, a "New York Times" reporter published an article on his acupuncture experiences in China, which led to more investigation of and support for acupuncture. The US President <a href="1972%20Nixon%20visit%20to%20China">Richard Nixon visited China in 1972</a>. During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a>. Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high <a href="pain%20tolerance">pain tolerance</a> and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving <a href="morphine">morphine</a> surreptitiously through an <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenous drip</a> that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients. One patient receiving <a href="open%20heart%20surgery">open heart surgery</a> while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a <a href="local%20anesthetic">local anesthetic</a> into the wound. After the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Health">National Institute of Health</a> expressed support for acupuncture for a limited number of conditions, adoption in the US grew further. In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the US was established in Washington DC and in 1973 the American <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.

In 2006, a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary "Alternative Medicine" filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia. It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of anesthetics.

In 2010, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> inscribed "acupuncture and <a href="moxibustion">moxibustion</a> of traditional Chinese medicine" on the <a href="UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists">UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List</a> following China's nomination.

Acupuncture is popular in China, the US, Australia, and Europe including all five <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic countries</a>, though less so in Finland. It is most heavily practiced in China and is one of the most common alternative medicine practices in Europe. In Switzerland, acupuncture has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since 2004. In the United Kingdom, a total of 4 million acupuncture treatments were administered in 2009. Acupuncture is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the UK. An estimated 1 in 10 adults in Australia used acupuncture in 2004. In Japan, it is estimated that 25 percent of the population will try acupuncture at some point, though in most cases it is not covered by <a href="Health%20care%20system%20in%20Japan">public health insurance</a>. Users of acupuncture in Japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education. Approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future, while 37% did not. Less than one percent of the US population reported having used acupuncture in the early 1990s. By the early 2010s, more than 14 million Americans reported having used acupuncture as part of their health care.

In the US, acupuncture is increasingly () used at <a href="academic%20medical%20centers">academic medical centers</a>, and is usually offered through CAM centers or anesthesia and pain management services. Examples include those at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, and <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>. This usage has been criticized owing to there being little scientific evidence for explicit effects, or the mechanisms for its supposed effectiveness, for any condition that is discernible from placebo. Acupuncture has been called 'theatrical placebo', and <a href="David%20Gorski">David Gorski</a> argues that when acupuncture proponents advocate 'harnessing of placebo effects' or work on developing 'meaningful placebos', they essentially concede it is little more than that.

The use of acupuncture in Germany increased by 20% in 2007, after the <a href="German%20acupuncture%20trials">German acupuncture trials</a> supported its efficacy for certain uses. In 2011, there were more than one million users, and insurance companies have estimated that two-thirds of German users are women. As a result of the trials, German <a href="Publicly%20funded%20health%20care">public health insurers</a> began to cover acupuncture for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not tension headache or migraine. This decision was based in part on <a href="socio-political">socio-political</a> reasons. Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of acupuncture because of the trials. For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that acupuncture had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments. Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.

There are various government and trade association regulatory bodies for acupuncture in the United Kingdom, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Japan, Canada, and in European countries and elsewhere. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> recommends that before being licensed or certified, an acupuncturist receive 200 hours of specialized training if they are a physician and 2,500 hours for non-physicians; many governments have adopted similar standards.

In China, the practice of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board. Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation. Regulation in the US began in the 1970s in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho. Licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state. The needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the US by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>. In some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners, while in others by the board of licensing, health or education.

In Japan, acupuncturists are licensed by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%2C%20Labour%2C%20and%20Welfare">Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare</a> after passing an examination and graduating from a technical school or university. Australia regulates Chinese medical traditions through the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and the Public Health (Skin Penetration) Regulation of 2000. It restricts the use of words like "Acupuncture" and "Registered Acupuncturist". At least 28 countries in Europe have professional associations for acupuncturists. In France, the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Nationale%20de%20M%C3%A9decine">Académie Nationale de Médecine</a> (National Academy of Medicine) has regulated acupuncture since 1955.

Aeneas

In <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, Aeneas (; <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: Αἰνείας, "Aineías", possibly derived from Greek meaning "praised") was a <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> <a href="hero">hero</a>, the son of the prince <a href="Anchises">Anchises</a> and the goddess <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> (<a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>). His father was a first <a href="cousin">cousin</a> of King <a href="Priam">Priam</a> of Troy (both being grandsons of <a href="Ilus%23Ilus%20%28son%20of%20Tros%29">Ilus</a>, founder of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's <a href="List%20of%20children%20of%20Priam">children</a> (such as <a href="Hector">Hector</a> and <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a>). He is a character in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and is mentioned in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". Aeneas receives full treatment in <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman mythology</a>, most extensively in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>," where he is an ancestor of <a href="Romulus%20and%20Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>. He became the first true hero of Rome. <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> identifies him with the Norse <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a> <a href="Vidarr">Vidarr</a>.

Aeneas is the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> spelling of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> Αἰνείας ("Aineías"). In the Homeric Hymn to <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, Aeneas is first introduced with Aphrodite naming him Αἰνείας ("Aineías") for the αὶνóν ἄχος ("terrible grief") he caused her, where "Aineías" derives from the adjective αὶνóν ("ainon", meaning "terrible"). It is a popular etymology for the name, apparently exploited by Homer in the Iliad. Later in the Medieval period there were writers who held that, because the Aeneid was written by a philosopher it is meant to be read philosophically. As such, in the "natural order", the meaning of Aeneas' name combines Greek "ennos" ("dweller") and "demas" ("body"), which becomes "ennaios", meaning "in-dweller" (i.e. as a god inhabiting a mortal body). However, there is no certainty regarding the origin of his name.

In imitation of the "Iliad", Virgil borrows epithets of Homer, including; Anchisiades, "magnanimum", "magnus", "heros", and "bonus". Though he borrows many, Virgil gives Aeneas two epithets of his own in the "Aeneid:" "pater" and "pius". The epithets applied by Virgil are an example of an attitude different from that of Homer, for whilst Odysseus is "poikilios" ("wily"), Aeneas is described as "pius" ("pious"), which conveys a strong moral tone. The purpose of these epithets seem to enforce the notion of Aeneas' divine hand as father and founder of the Roman race, and their use seem circumstantial: when Aeneas is praying he refers to himself as pius, and is referred to as such by the author only when the character is acting on behalf of the gods to fulfill his divine mission. Likewise, Aeneas is called "pater" when acting in the interest of his men.

The story of the birth of Aeneas is told in the "Hymn to Aphrodite", one of the major <a href="Homeric%20Hymns">Homeric Hymns</a>. Aphrodite has caused the other god <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, to fall in love with mortal women. In retaliation, Zeus puts desire in her heart for Anchises, who is tending his cattle among the hills near <a href="Mount%20Ida">Mount Ida</a>. When Aphrodite sees him she is smitten. She adorns herself as if for a wedding among the gods and appears before him. He is overcome by her beauty, believing that she is a goddess, but Aphrodite identifies herself as a <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>n princess. After they make love, Aphrodite reveals her true identity to him and Anchises fears what might happen to him as a result of their liaison. Aphrodite assures him that he will be protected, and tells him that she will bear him a son to be called Aeneas. However, she warns him that he must never tell anyone that he has lain with a goddess. When Aeneas is born, Aphrodite takes him to the <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s of Mount Ida. She directs them to raise the child to age five, then take him to Anchises. According to other sources, Anchises later brags about his encounter with Aphrodite, and as a result is struck in the foot with a thunderbolt by Zeus. Thereafter he is lame in that foot, so that Aeneas has to carry him from the flames of Troy.

Aeneas is a minor character in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", where he is twice saved from death by the gods as if for an as-yet-unknown destiny, but is an honorable warrior in his own right. Having held back from the fighting, aggrieved with Priam because in spite of his brave deeds he was not given his due share of honour, he leads an attack against Idomeneus to recover the body of his brother-in-law Alcathous at the urging of <a href="Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>. He is the leader of the Trojans' <a href="Dardanians%20%28Trojan%29">Dardanian</a> allies, as well as a second cousin and principal lieutenant of <a href="Hector">Hector</a>, son of the Trojan king <a href="Priam">Priam</a>. Aeneas's mother <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> frequently comes to his aid on the battlefield, and he is a favorite of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. Aphrodite and Apollo rescue Aeneas from combat with <a href="Diomedes">Diomedes</a> of <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, who nearly kills him, and carry him away to <a href="Pergamos">Pergamos</a> for healing. Even <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, who normally favors the Greeks, comes to Aeneas's rescue after he falls under the assault of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, noting that Aeneas, though from a junior branch of the royal family, is destined to become king of the Trojan people. Bruce Louden presents Aeneas as a "type" in the tradition of <a href="Utnapishtim">Utnapishtim</a>, <a href="Baucis%20and%20Philemon">Baucis and Philemon</a>, and <a href="Lot%20%28biblical%20person%29">Lot</a>; the just man spared the general destruction. Apollodorus explains that "...the Greeks let him alone on account of his piety".

The Roman mythographer <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Gaius Julius Hyginus</a> (c. 64 BCE – CE 17) in his "Fabulae" credits Aeneas with killing 28 enemies in the Trojan War. Aeneas also appears in the Trojan narratives attributed to <a href="Dares%20Phrygius">Dares Phrygius</a> and <a href="Dictys%20Cretensis">Dictys Cretensis</a>.

<a href="Snorri%20Sturlason">Snorri Sturlason</a> tells of the Trojans in the Prologue to his <a href="Edda">Edda</a>. He tells of a king of Troja, <a href="Munon">Munon</a> or <a href="Menon%20%28Trojan%29">Menon</a>, who marries the daughter of the High King (Yfirkonungr) <a href="Priam">Priam</a> called <a href="Troan">Troan</a>. They got a son, <a href="Tror">Tror</a>, who, as Snorri tells, is identical to <a href="Thor">Thor</a>. In the same Prologue Snorri tells of the world as parted in three continents: <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and the third part is called <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and Enea as well.

The history of Aeneas was continued by Roman authors. One influential source was the account of Rome's founding in <a href="Cato%20the%20Elder">Cato the Elder</a>'s "<a href="Origines">Origines</a>". The Aeneas legend was well known in Virgil's day and appeared in various historical works, including the "Roman Antiquities" of the Greek historian <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a> (relying on <a href="Marcus%20Terentius%20Varro">Marcus Terentius Varro</a>), "<a href="Ab%20Urbe%20Condita%20%28book%29">Ab Urbe Condita</a>" by <a href="Livy">Livy</a> (probably dependent on <a href="Quintus%20Fabius%20Pictor">Quintus Fabius Pictor</a>, fl. 200 BCE), and <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Trogus">Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus</a> (now extant only in an epitome by <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a>).

The "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" explains that Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed or enslaved when Troy fell. Aeneas, after being commanded by the gods to flee, gathered a group, collectively known as the <a href="Aeneads">Aeneads</a>, who then traveled to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and became progenitors of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>. The Aeneads included Aeneas's trumpeter <a href="Misenus">Misenus</a>, his father <a href="Anchises">Anchises</a>, his friends <a href="Achates">Achates</a>, <a href="Sergestus">Sergestus</a>, and <a href="Acmon%2C%20the%20Aenead">Acmon</a>, the healer <a href="Iapyx">Iapyx</a>, the helmsman <a href="Palinurus">Palinurus</a>, and his son <a href="Ascanius">Ascanius</a> (also known as Iulus, Julus, or Ascanius Julius). He carried with him the <a href="Lares">Lares</a> and <a href="Penates">Penates</a>, the statues of the household gods of Troy, and transplanted them to Italy.

Several attempts to find a new home failed; one such stop was on <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, where in <a href="Trapani">Drepanum</a>, on the island's western coast, his father, Anchises, died peacefully.

After a brief but fierce storm sent up against the group at <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a>'s request, Aeneas and his fleet made landfall at <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> after six years of wanderings. Aeneas had a year-long affair with the Carthaginian queen <a href="Dido%20%28Queen%20of%20Carthage%29">Dido</a> (also known as Elissa), who proposed that the Trojans settle in her land and that she and Aeneas reign jointly over their peoples. A marriage of sorts was arranged between Dido and Aeneas at the instigation of Juno, who was told that her favorite city would eventually be defeated by the Trojans' descendants. Aeneas's mother <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> (the Roman adaptation of Aphrodite) realized that her son and his company needed a temporary respite to reinforce themselves for the journey to come. However, the messenger god <a href="Mercury%20%28mythology%29">Mercury</a> was sent by <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> and Venus to remind Aeneas of his journey and his purpose, compelling him to leave secretly. When Dido learned of this, she uttered a curse that would forever pit Carthage against Rome, an enmity that would culminate in the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>. She then committed suicide by stabbing herself with the same sword she gave Aeneas when they first met.

After the sojourn in Carthage, the Trojans returned to Sicily where Aeneas organized <a href="funeral%20games%20%28antiquity%29">funeral games</a> to honor his father, who had died a year before. The company traveled on and landed on the western coast of Italy. Aeneas descended into the underworld where he met Dido (who turned away from him to return to her husband) and his father, who showed him the future of his descendants and thus the history of Rome.

<a href="Latinus">Latinus</a>, king of the Latins, welcomed Aeneas's army of exiled Trojans and let them reorganize their lives in <a href="Latium">Latium</a>. His daughter <a href="Lavinia">Lavinia</a> had been promised to <a href="Turnus">Turnus</a>, king of the <a href="Rutuli">Rutuli</a>, but Latinus received a prophecy that Lavinia would be betrothed to one from another land — namely, Aeneas. Latinus heeded the prophecy, and Turnus consequently declared war on Aeneas at the urging of Juno, who was aligned with King <a href="Mezentius">Mezentius</a> of <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">the Etruscans</a> and Queen <a href="Amata">Amata</a> of the Latins. Aeneas's forces prevailed. Turnus was killed, and Virgil's account ends abruptly.

The rest of Aeneas's biography is gleaned from other ancient sources, including Livy and Ovid's "Metamorphoses". According to Livy, Aeneas was victorious but Latinus died in the war. Aeneas founded the city of <a href="Lavinium">Lavinium</a>, named after his wife. He later welcomed Dido's sister, <a href="Anna%20Perenna">Anna Perenna</a>, who then committed suicide after learning of Lavinia's jealousy. After Aeneas's death, Venus asked Jupiter to make her son immortal. Jupiter agreed. The river god <a href="Numicus">Numicus</a> cleansed Aeneas of all his mortal parts and Venus anointed him with ambrosia and nectar, making him a god. Aeneas was recognized as the god <a href="Jupiter%20Indiges">Jupiter Indiges</a>.

Continuations of Trojan matter in the Middle Ages had their effects on the character of Aeneas as well. The 12th-century French "<a href="Roman%20d%27En%C3%A9as">Roman d'Enéas</a>" addresses Aeneas's sexuality. Though Virgil appears to deflect all homoeroticism onto <a href="Nisus%20and%20Euryalus">Nisus and Euryalus</a>, making his Aeneas a purely heterosexual character, in the Middle Ages there was at least a suspicion of homoeroticism in Aeneas. The "Roman d'Enéas" addresses that charge, when <a href="Amata">Queen Amata</a> opposes Aeneas's marrying <a href="Lavinia">Lavinia</a>, claiming that Aeneas loved boys.

Medieval interpretations of Aeneas were greatly influenced by both Virgil and other Latin sources. Specifically, the accounts by Dares and Dictys, which were reworked by 13th-century Italian writer <a href="Guido%20delle%20Colonne">Guido delle Colonne</a> (in "<a href="Historia%20destructionis%20Troiae">Historia destructionis Troiae</a>"), colored many later readings. From Guido, for instance, the <a href="Pearl%20Poet">Pearl Poet</a> and other English writers get the suggestion that Aeneas's safe departure from Troy with his possessions and family was a reward for treason, for which he was chastised by <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>. In "<a href="Sir%20Gawain%20and%20the%20Green%20Knight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a>" (late 14th century) the Pearl Poet, like many other English writers, employed Aeneas to establish a genealogy for the foundation of Britain, and explains that Aeneas was "impeached for his perfidy, proven most true" (line 4).

Aeneas had an extensive family tree. His <a href="wet-nurse">wet-nurse</a> was <a href="Caieta">Caieta</a>, and he is the father of <a href="Ascanius">Ascanius</a> with <a href="Creusa%20%28wife%20of%20Aeneas%29">Creusa</a>, and of <a href="Silvius%20%28mythology%29">Silvius</a> with Lavinia. Ascanius, also known as <a href="Iulus">Iulus</a> (or Julius), founded <a href="Alba%20Longa">Alba Longa</a> and was the first in a <a href="Latin%20kings%20of%20Alba%20Longa">long series of kings</a>. According to the mythology outlined by Virgil in the "Aeneid," Romulus and Remus were both descendants of Aeneas through their mother Rhea Silvia, making Aeneas the progenitor of the Roman people. Some early sources call him their father or grandfather, but considering the commonly accepted dates of the fall of Troy (1184 BC) and the founding of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> (753 BC), this seems unlikely. The <a href="Gens%20Julia">Julian family</a> of Rome, most notably <a href="Julius%20C%C3%A6sar">Julius Cæsar</a> and <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, traced their lineage to Ascanius and Aeneas, thus to the goddess Venus. Through the Julians, the <a href="Palemonids">Palemonids</a> make this claim. The legendary <a href="List%20of%20legendary%20kings%20of%20Britain">kings of Britain</a> – including <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> – trace their family through a grandson of Aeneas, <a href="Brutus%20of%20Britain">Brutus</a>.

Aeneas's consistent epithet in Virgil and other Latin authors is "pius", a term that connotes reverence toward the gods and familial dutifulness.

In the "Aeneid", Aeneas is described as strong and handsome, but neither his hair colour nor complexion are described. In late antiquity however sources add further physical descriptions. The "De excidio Troiae" of <a href="Dares%20Phrygius">Dares Phrygius</a> describes Aeneas as ‘‘auburn-haired, stocky, eloquent, courteous, prudent, pious, and charming.’’ There is also a brief physical description found in <a href="John%20Malalas">John Malalas</a>' "Chronographia": ‘‘Aeneas: short, fat, with a good chest, powerful, with a ruddy complexion, a broad face, a good nose, fair skin, bald on the forehead, a good beard, grey eyes.’’

Aeneas and <a href="Dido%20%28Queen%20of%20Carthage%29">Dido</a> are the main characters of a 17th-century <a href="broadside%20%28music%29">broadside</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> called "<a href="The%20Wandering%20Prince%20of%20Troy">The Wandering Prince of Troy</a>." The ballad ultimately alters Aeneas's fate from traveling on years after Dido's death to joining her as a spirit soon after her suicide.

In modern literature, Aeneas is the speaker in two poems by <a href="Allen%20Tate">Allen Tate</a>, "Aeneas at Washington" and "Aeneas at New York." He is a main character in <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s "<a href="Lavinia%20%28novel%29">Lavinia</a>", a re-telling of the last six books of the "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" told from the point of view of <a href="Lavinia">Lavinia</a>, daughter of King <a href="Latinus">Latinus</a> of <a href="Latium">Latium</a>.

Aeneas appears in <a href="David%20Gemmell">David Gemmell</a>'s "Troy" series as a main heroic character who goes by the name <a href="Helikaon">Helikaon</a>.

In <a href="Rick%20Riordan">Rick Riordan</a>'s book series, "<a href="The%20Heroes%20of%20Olympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a>", Aeneas is regarded as the first Roman demigod, son of <a href="Venus">Venus</a> rather than Aphrodite.

Aeneas is a title character in <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>'s opera "<a href="Dido%20and%20Aeneas">Dido and Aeneas</a>" (c. 1688), and one of the principal roles in <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>' opera "<a href="Les%20Troyens">Les Troyens</a>" (c. 1857).

Despite its many dramatic elements, Aeneas's story has generated little interest from the film industry. Portrayed by <a href="Steve%20Reeves">Steve Reeves</a>, he was the main character in the 1961 <a href="sword%20and%20sandal">sword and sandal</a> film "<a href="Guerra%20di%20Troia">Guerra di Troia</a>" ("The Trojan War"). Reeves reprised the role the following year in the film "<a href="The%20Avenger%20%281962%20film%29">The Avenger</a>", about Aeneas's arrival in <a href="Latium">Latium</a> and his conflicts with local tribes as he tries to settle his fellow Trojan refugees there.

The most recent cinematic portrayal of Aeneas was in the film "<a href="Troy%20%28film%29">Troy</a>", in which he appears as a youth charged by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> to protect the Trojan refugees, and to continue the ideals of the city and its people. Paris gives Aeneas Priam's sword, in order to give legitimacy and continuity to the royal line of Troy – and lay the foundations of Roman culture. In this film, he is not a member of the royal family and does not appear to fight in the war.

In the role-playing game "" by White Wolf Game Studios, Aeneas figures as one of the mythical founders of the <a href="Ventrue%20Clan">Ventrue Clan</a>.

in the action game "", Aeneas is a playable character. The game ends with him and the Aeneans fleeing Troy's destruction and, spurned by the words of a prophetess thought crazed, goes to a new country (Italy) where he will start an empire greater than Greece and Troy combined that shall rule the world for 1000 years, never to be outdone in the tale of men (The Roman Empire).

In the 2018 TV miniseries "", Aeneas will be portrayed by <a href="Alfred%20Enoch">Alfred Enoch</a>.

Scenes depicting Aeneas, especially from the Aeneid, have been the focus of study for centuries. They have been the frequent subject of art and literature since their debut in the 1st century.

The artist <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Tiepolo">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</a> was commissioned by Gaetano Valmarana in 1757 to fresco several rooms in the Villa Valmarana, the family villa situated outside <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>. Tiepolo decorated the "palazzina" with scenes from epics such as Homer's "Iliad" and Virgil's "Aeneid".

Amaranth

Amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth, is a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan</a> <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="annual%20plant">annual</a> or short-lived <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial plant</a>s. Some amaranth species are cultivated as <a href="leaf%20vegetable">leaf vegetable</a>s, <a href="pseudocereal">pseudocereal</a>s, and <a href="ornamental%20plant">ornamental plant</a>s. Most of the "Amaranthus" species are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as <a href="pigweed">pigweed</a>. <a href="Catkin">Catkin</a>-like <a href="cyme%20%28botany%29">cymes</a> of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. Approximately 60 <a href="species">species</a> are recognized, with <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s and foliage ranging from purple, through red and green to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus "<a href="Celosia">Celosia</a>".

"Amaranth" derives from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ("amárantos"), "unfading", with the Greek word for "flower", ("ánthos"), factoring into the word's development as "amaranth". "Amarant" is an archaic variant.

"Amaranthus" shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species. Although the family (<a href="Amaranthaceae">Amaranthaceae</a>) is distinctive, the <a href="genus">genus</a> has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included. This complicates <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> and "Amaranthus" has generally been considered among systematists as a "difficult" genus.

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between <a href="Plant%20sexual%20morphology%23Individual%20plant%20morphology">monoecious</a> and <a href="Plant%20sexual%20morphology%23Individual%20plant%20morphology">dioecious</a> species: "Acnida" (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and "Amaranthus". Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.

Currently, "Amaranthus" includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> and species concepts. Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification. A modified infrageneric classification of "Amaranthus" was published by Mosyakin & Robertson (1996) and includes three subgenera: "Acnida", "Amaranthus", and "Albersia". The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.

Species include:

One cup (2.4 dl, 245 g) of cooked amaranth grain (from about 65 g raw) provides 251 <a href="calories">calories</a> and is an excellent source (20% or more of the <a href="Daily%20Value">Daily Value</a>, DV) of <a href="protein">protein</a>, <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a>, and some <a href="dietary%20minerals">dietary minerals</a>. Amaranth is particularly rich in <a href="manganese">manganese</a> (105% DV), <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> (40% DV), <a href="iron">iron</a> (29% DV), and <a href="selenium">selenium</a> (20% DV).

Cooked amaranth leaves are an excellent source of <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>, <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, manganese, and <a href="folate">folate</a>.

Amaranth does not contain <a href="gluten">gluten</a>, so it may be a healthy and less expensive alternative to ingredients traditionally used in <a href="gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free products</a>. It has high <a href="biological%20value">biological value</a> and its benefits are not limited to people with <a href="gluten-related%20disorders">gluten-related disorders</a>, but are applicable to the general population. Quantity and quality of proteins of amaranth are superior to those of wheat. It also contains higher concentrations of <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a> than wheat (102 µg/100 g in amaranth vs. 40 µg/100 g in wheat), and its fiber and minerals contents are higher than those of other cereals.

Amaranth contains <a href="phytochemical">phytochemical</a>s that may be <a href="antinutrient">antinutrient</a> factors, such as <a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s, <a href="saponin">saponin</a>s, <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s, and <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a>s which are reduced in content and effect by cooking.

Known to the <a href="Aztecs">Aztecs</a> as "huauhtli", amaranth is thought to have represented up to 80% of their energy consumption before the Spanish conquest. Another important use of amaranth throughout <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> was to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, <a href="amaranth%20grain">amaranth grain</a>s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey, molasses, or chocolate to make a treat called "alegría", meaning "joy" in Spanish. <a href="Diego%20Dur%C3%A1n">Diego Durán</a> described the festivities for <a href="Huitzilopochtli">Huitzilopochtli</a>, the name of which means "hummingbird of the left side" or "left-handed hummingbird" (Real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of <a href="Aztec%20calendar">Panquetzaliztli</a> (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its gluten-free palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially "A. cruentus" and "A. hypochondriacus") revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America. Amaranth and <a href="quinoa">quinoa</a> are not grasses and are called <a href="pseudocereal">pseudocereal</a>s because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and cooking.

Several species are raised for amaranth <a href="pseudograin">"grain"</a> in Asia and the Americas.

Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species, "<a href="Amaranthus%20caudatus">Amaranthus caudatus</a>", "<a href="Amaranthus%20cruentus">Amaranthus cruentus</a>", and "<a href="Amaranthus%20hypochondriacus">Amaranthus hypochondriacus</a>". Although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there, along with India, China, Nepal, and other tropical countries; thus, the potential exists for further cultivation in those countries, as well as in the U.S. In a 1977 article in "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>", amaranth was described as "the crop of the future". It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a <a href="leaf%20vegetable">leaf vegetable</a> in many parts of the world. Four species of "Amaranthus" are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: "<a href="Amaranthus%20cruentus">Amaranthus cruentus</a>", "<a href="Amaranthus%20blitum">Amaranthus blitum</a>, <a href="Amaranthus%20dubius">Amaranthus dubius</a>", and "<a href="Amaranthus%20tricolor">Amaranthus tricolor</a>".

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called "bayam". In the Philippines, the <a href="Ilocano%20language">Ilocano</a> word for the plant is "kalunay"; the Tagalog word for the plant is "kilitis" or "kulitis". In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India, it is called "chaulai" and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called "<a href="saag">saag</a>"). It is called "chua" in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called "harive". It is used to prepare curries such as" hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee", and so on. In Kerala, it is called "cheera" and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make "cheera <a href="thoran">thoran</a>". In Tamil Nadu, it is called "mulaikkira" and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chili, and cumin. It is called "keerai masial". In Andhra Pradesh, this leaf is added in preparation of a popular "<a href="dal">dal</a>" called "thotakura pappu" in (<a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>). In Maharashtra, it is called "shravani maath" and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called "khada saga", it is used to prepare "saga bhaja", in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called "rau dền" and is used to make <a href="soup">soup</a>. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: "dền đỏ"- "Amaranthus tricolor" and "dền cơm" or "dền trắng"- "Amaranthus viridis".

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost <a href="food%20security">food security</a>, foster rural development and support sustainable land care.

In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as "doodo" or "litoto". It is also known among the <a href="Kalenjin%20people">Kalenjin</a> as a <a href="drought">drought</a> crop ("chepkerta"). In <a href="Lingala%20language">Lingala</a> (spoken in the Congo), it is known as "lɛngalɛnga" or "bítɛkutɛku". In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a> as "shoko" a short form of "shokoyokoto" (meaning make the husband fat) or "arowo jeja" (meaning "we have money left over for fish"). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called "bhaji" in Trinidad and "callaloo" in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as "morug" and cooked as a staple green vegetable.

In Greece, green amaranth ("A. viridis") is a popular dish called βλήτα, "vlita" or "vleeta". It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, frequently regarded as an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported "A. caudatus" cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of or , which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, <a href="rice%20and%20beans">rice and beans</a>.

Making up about 5% of the total <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s of amaranth, <a href="squalene">squalene</a> is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive <a href="shark%20oil">shark oil</a> for use in <a href="dietary%20supplements">dietary supplements</a> and <a href="cosmetics">cosmetics</a>.

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the <a href="Hopi">Hopi</a> (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red <a href="natural%20dye">dye</a>. Also a synthetic dye was named "<a href="Amaranth%20%28dye%29">amaranth</a>" for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s known as <a href="betalain">betalain</a>s. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.

The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as "Amaranthus caudatus" (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish <a href="flower">flower</a>s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, "A. hypochondriacus" (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> (<a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> and <a href="moth">moth</a>) species including the <a href="Nutmeg%20%28moth%29">nutmeg moth</a> and various case-bearer moths of the genus "<a href="Coleophora">Coleophora</a>": "C. amaranthella", "C. enchorda" (feeds exclusively on "Amaranthus"), "C. immortalis" (feeds exclusively on "Amaranthus"), "C. lineapulvella", and "C. versurella" (recorded on "A. spinosus").

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production, and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in <a href="tillage">tillage</a>, reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often. The following 9 species of "Amaranthus" are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: "A. albus", "A. blitoides", "A. hybridus", "A. palmeri", "A. powellii", "A. retroflexus", "A. spinosus", "A. tuberculatus", and "A. viridis".

A new herbicide-resistant strain of "<a href="Amaranthus%20palmeri">Amaranthus palmeri</a>" has appeared; it is <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. This could be of particular concern to <a href="cotton">cotton</a> farmers using glyphosate-resistant cotton. The species "Amaranthus palmeri" (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in <a href="soybean">soybean</a> yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments. Palmer amaranth is among the "top five most troublesome weeds" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to <a href="dinitroaniline">dinitroaniline</a> herbicides and <a href="acetolactate%20synthase%20inhibitor">acetolactate synthase inhibitor</a>s. This makes the proper identification of "Amaranthus" species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

Agapanthus africanus

Agapanthus africanus (African lily) is a flowering plant from the genus "<a href="Agapanthus">Agapanthus</a>" native to the area of <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. "A. africanus" is more difficult to grow in gardens than <a href="Agapanthus%20praecox">"A. praecox"</a>, and almost all plants sold as "A. africanus" are actually "A. praecox".

It has a short stem bearing a tuft of long, narrow, arching leaves 10–35 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, and a central flower stalk 25–60 cm tall, ending in an umbel of 20-30 white, or bright blue, funnel-shaped <a href="flower">flower</a>s, each flower 2.5–5 cm diameter.

It was introduced to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> at the close of the 17th century. Unlike the more common "A. praecox", it is not generally suitable as a garden plant, and will not tolerate extended freezing temperatures.

Agamemnon

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Agamemnon (; from *Ἀγαμέδμων [from ἄγαν, "very much" and <a href="wikt%3A%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%B9">μέδομαι</a>, "think on"], "very steadfast", "unbowed") was the son of King <a href="Atreus">Atreus</a> and Queen <a href="Aerope">Aerope</a> of <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>, the brother of <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, the husband of <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a> and the father of <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>, <a href="Electra">Electra</a> or Laodike (Λαοδίκη), <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a> and <a href="Chrysothemis">Chrysothemis</a>. Legends make him the king of Mycenae or <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, thought to be different names for the same area. When <a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen</a>, the wife of Menelaus, was taken to <a href="Troy">Troy</a> by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a>, Agamemnon commanded the united Greek armed forces in the ensuing <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>.

Upon Agamemnon's return from Troy, he was murdered (according to the oldest surviving account, "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" 11.409–11) by <a href="Aegisthus">Aegisthus</a>, the lover of his wife, Clytemnestra. In old versions of the story, the scene of the murder, when it is specified, is usually the house of Aegisthus, who has not taken up residence in Agamemnon's palace, and it involves an ambush and the deaths of Agamemnon's followers as well. In some later versions Clytemnestra herself does the killing, or they act together as accomplices, killing Agamemnon in his own home.

<a href="Atreus">Atreus</a>, Agamemnon's father, murdered the children of his twin brother <a href="Thyestes">Thyestes</a> and fed them to Thyestes after discovering Thyestes' <a href="adultery">adultery</a> with his wife Aerope. Thyestes fathered <a href="Aegisthus">Aegisthus</a> with his own daughter, <a href="Pelopia">Pelopia</a>, and this son vowed gruesome revenge on Atreus' children. Aegisthus successfully murdered Atreus and restored his father to the throne. Aegisthus took possession of the throne of Mycenae and jointly ruled with Thyestes. During this period, Agamemnon and his brother, <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, took refuge with <a href="Tyndareus">Tyndareus</a>, King of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>. There they respectively married Tyndareus' daughters <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a> and Helen. Agamemnon and Clytemnestra had four children: one son, <a href="Orestes%20%28mythology%29">Orestes</a>, and three daughters, <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>, <a href="Electra">Electra</a> and <a href="Chrysothemis">Chrysothemis</a>. Menelaus succeeded Tyndareus in Sparta, while Agamemnon, with his brother's assistance, drove out Aegisthus and Thyestes to recover his father's kingdom. He extended his dominion by conquest and became the most powerful prince in Greece.

Agamemnon's family history had been tarnished by <a href="rape">rape</a>, <a href="murder">murder</a>, <a href="incest">incest</a>, and <a href="Betrayal">treachery</a>, consequences of the heinous crime perpetrated by his ancestor, <a href="Tantalus">Tantalus</a>, and then of a curse placed upon <a href="Pelops">Pelops</a>, son of <a href="Tantalus">Tantalus</a>, by <a href="Myrtilus">Myrtilus</a>, whom he had murdered. Thus misfortune hounded successive generations of the <a href="House%20of%20Atreus">House of Atreus</a>, until atoned by <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a> in a court of justice held jointly by humans and gods.

Agamemnon gathered the reluctant Greek forces to sail for <a href="Troy">Troy</a>. Preparing to depart from <a href="Aulis%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Aulis</a>, which was a port in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, Agamemnon's army incurred the wrath of the goddess <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. There are several reasons throughout myth for such wrath: in <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' play "<a href="Agamemnon%20%28play%29">Agamemnon</a>", Artemis is angry for the young men who will die at Troy, whereas in <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>' "<a href="Electra%20%28Sophocles%29">Electra</a>", Agamemnon has slain an animal sacred to Artemis, and subsequently boasted that he was Artemis' equal in hunting. Misfortunes, including a <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> and a lack of wind, prevented the army from sailing. Finally, the prophet <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> announced that the wrath of the goddess could only be propitiated by the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>.

Classical dramatizations differ on how willing either father or daughter was to this fate; some include such trickery as claiming she was to be married to <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, but Agamemnon did eventually sacrifice Iphigenia. Her death appeased Artemis, and the Greek army set out for Troy. Several alternatives to the <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> have been presented in Greek mythology. Other sources, such as "<a href="Iphigenia%20at%20Aulis">Iphigenia at Aulis</a>", say that Agamemnon was prepared to kill his daughter, but that Artemis accepted a deer in her place, and whisked her away to <a href="Tauris">Tauris</a> in the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>. <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> said she became the goddess <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a>.

Agamemnon was the <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the Greeks during the Trojan War. During the fighting, Agamemnon killed <a href="Antiphus">Antiphus</a> and fifteen other Trojan soldiers, according to one source. But in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" itself, he's shown to slaughter hundreds more in pageRank.Book 11 during his "aristea" loosely translated to "day of glory" which is the most similar to Achilles' "aristea" in pageRank.Book 21 (they both are compared to lions and destructive fires in battle, their hands are described as "splattered with gore" and "invincible," the Trojans flee to the walls, they both are appealed to by one of their victims, they are both avoided by Hector, they both get wounded in the arm or hand, and they both kill the one who wounded them). Even before his "aristea," Agamemnon was considered to be one of the three best warriors on the Greek side as proven when Hector challenges any champion of the Greek side to fight him in pageRank.Book 7, and Agamemnon (along with Diomedes and Big Aias) is one of the three most wished for to face him out of the nine strongest Greek warriors who volunteered. And after they reconciled, even Achilles admits in pageRank.Book 23 that Agamemnon is "the best in strength and in throwing the spear." That claim is further proven by the fact that Agamemnon was the only major warrior on either side to never need the gods' direct intervention to increase his strength or give him any unfair advantages in battle and yet he still caused incredible destruction almost on the scale of Achilles.

The "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" tells the story about the quarrel between Agamemnon and <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> in the final year of the war. Following one of the Achaean Army's raids, <a href="Chryseis">Chryseis</a>, daughter of <a href="Chryses">Chryses</a>, one of Apollo's priests, was taken as a war prize by Agamemnon. Chryses pleaded with Agamemnon to free his daughter but was met with little success. Chryses then prayed to Apollo for the safe return of his daughter, which Apollo responded to by unleashing a plague over the Achaean Army. After learning from the Prophet Calchas that the plague could be dispelled by returning Chryseis to her father, Agamemnon reluctantly agreed, (but first berated Calchas for previously forcing Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter (<a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>) and released his prize. However, as compensation for his lost prize, Agamemnon demanded a new prize. As a result, Agamemnon stole an attractive slave called <a href="Briseis">Briseis</a>, one of the spoils of war, from Achilles.

Achilles, the greatest warrior of the age, withdrew from battle in response to Agamemnon's action and put the Greek armies at risk of losing the war. Agamemnon, having realized Achilles's importance in winning the war against the Trojan Army, sent ambassadors begging for Achilles to return, offering him riches and the hand of his daughter in marriage, but Achilles refused, only being spurred back into action when his closest friend, Patroclus, was killed in battle.

Although not the equal of Achilles in bravery, Agamemnon was a representative of "kingly authority". As commander-in-chief, he summoned the princes to the council and led the army in battle. His chief fault was his overwhelming haughtiness; an over-exalted opinion of his position that led him to insult <a href="Chryses">Chryses</a> and Achilles, thereby bringing great disaster upon the Greeks.

After the capture of Troy, <a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a>, the doomed prophetess and daughter of <a href="Priam">Priam</a>, fell to Agamemnon's lot in the distribution of the prizes of war.

After a stormy voyage, Agamemnon and Cassandra either landed in <a href="Argolis">Argolis</a>, or were blown off course and landed in Aegisthus' country. <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a>, Agamemnon's wife, had taken <a href="Aegisthus">Aegisthus</a>, son of <a href="Thyestes">Thyestes</a>, as a lover. When Agamemnon came home he was slain by either Aegisthus (in the oldest versions of the story) or Clytemnestra. According to the accounts given by <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a> and the tragedians, Agamemnon was slain in a bath by his wife alone, a blanket of cloth or a net having first been thrown over him to prevent resistance. Clytemnestra also killed Cassandra. Her jealousy of Cassandra, and her wrath at the sacrifice of Iphigenia and at Agamemnon's having gone to war over Helen of Troy, are said to have been the motives for her crime. 

Aegisthus and Clytemnestra then ruled Agamemnon's kingdom for a time, Aegisthus claiming his right of revenge for Agamemnon's father Atreus having fed Thyestes his own children (Thyestes then crying out "So perish all the race of Pleisthenes!", thus explaining Aegisthus' action as justified by his father's curse). Agamemnon's son <a href="Orestes">Orestes</a> later avenged his father's murder, with the help or encouragement of his sister <a href="Electra">Electra</a>, by murdering Aegisthus and Clytemnestra (his own mother), thereby inciting the wrath of the <a href="Erinyes">Erinyes</a> (<a href="English%20language">English</a>: the Furies), winged goddesses who tracked down wrongdoers with their hounds' noses and drove them to insanity.

<a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a> tells a tale of how Agamemnon mourned the loss of his friend or lover <a href="Argynnus">Argynnus</a>, when he drowned in the <a href="Cephissus%20%28Boeotia%29">Cephisus</a> river. He buried him, honored with a tomb and a shrine to <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> Argynnis. This episode is also found in <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a>, in <a href="Stephen%20of%20Byzantium">Stephen of Byzantium</a> "(Kopai" and "Argunnos)," and in <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, III with minor variations.
The fortunes of Agamemnon have formed the subject of numerous <a href="tragedy">tragedies</a>, ancient and modern, the most famous being the "<a href="Oresteia">Oresteia</a>" of <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>. In the legends of the <a href="Peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</a>, Agamemnon was regarded as the highest type of a powerful monarch, and in <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> he was worshipped under the title of "<a href="Agamemnon%20%28Zeus%29">Zeus Agamemnon</a>". His tomb was pointed out among the ruins of Mycenae and at <a href="Amyclae">Amyclae</a>.

Another account makes him the son of <a href="Pleisthenes">Pleisthenes</a> (the son or father of <a href="Atreus">Atreus</a>), who is said to have been Aerope's first husband.

In works of art, there is considerable resemblance between the representations of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, king of the gods, and Agamemnon, king of men. He is generally depicted with a <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> and <a href="diadem">diadem</a>, conventional attributes of kings.

Agamemnon's mare was named Aetha. She was also one of two horses driven by <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a> at the funeral games of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>.

Following his death at the hands of Aegisthus, Agamemnon made an appearance in <a href="Homer">Homer's</a> "Odyssey" within the kingdom of Hades. There, the former king met Odysseus and explained just how he was murdered before he offered Odysseus a warning about the dangers of trusting a woman.

Aga Khan I

<a href="Aga%20Khan">Aga Khan</a> I (; or ; ), was the title accorded to Hasan Ali Shah (; ; 1804 in Kahak, <a href="Iran">Iran</a> – 1881 in <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>), the governor of Kirman, 46th Imam of the <a href="Nizari">Nizari</a> <a href="Ismaili">Ismaili</a> Muslims, and prominent Muslim leader in Iran and later in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>.

The Imam Hasan Ali Shah was born in 1804 in <a href="Kahak%2C%20Qom">Kahak</a>, Iran to <a href="Sh%C4%81h%20Khal%C4%ABlull%C4%81h%20III">Shah Khalil Allah</a>, the 45th Ismaili Imam, and Bibi Sarkara, the daughter of Muhammad Sadiq Mahallati (d. 1815), a poet and a <a href="Ni%E2%80%98mat%20Allahi">Ni‘mat Allahi</a> Sufi. Shah Khalil Allah moved to <a href="Yazd">Yazd</a> in 1815, probably out of concern for his Indian followers, who used to travel to Persia to see their Imam and for whom Yazd was a much closer and safer destination than Kahak. Meanwhile, his wife and children continued to live in Kahak off the revenues obtained from the family holdings in the Mahallat () region. Two years later, in 1817, Shah Khalil Allah was killed during a conflict between some of his followers and local shopkeepers. He was succeeded by his eldest son Hasan Ali Shah, also known as Muhammad Hasan, who became the 46th Imam.

The family was left unprovided for after a conflict between the local Nizaris and Imani Khan Farahani, who had been married to one of the late Imam's daughters Shah Bibi and who had been in charge of the Imam's land holdings. The young Imam and his mother moved to Qumm, but their financial situation worsened. The Imam Hasan Ali Shah's mother decided to go to the Qajar court in Tehran to obtain justice for her husband's death and was eventually successful. Those who had been involved in the Shah Khalil Allah's murder were punished and the Persian king <a href="Fath%20Ali%20Shah">Fath Ali Shah</a> increased Hasan Ali Shah's land holdings in the Mahallat region and gave him one of his daughters, Sarv-i Jahan Khanum, in marriage. Fath Ali Shah also appointed Hasan Ali Shah as governor of <a href="Qumm">Qumm</a> and bestowed upon him the honorific of Aga Khan. Hasan Ali Shah thus become known as Aga Khan Mahallati, and the title of Aga Khan was inherited by his successors. Aga Khan I's mother later moved to India where she died in 1851. Until Fath Ali Shah's death in 1834, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah enjoyed a quiet life and was held in high esteem at the Qajar court.

Soon after the accession of <a href="Muhammad%20Shah%20Qajar">Muhammad Shah Qajar</a> to the throne of his grandfather, Fath Ali Shah, the Imam Hasan Ali Shah was appointed governor of <a href="Kerman">Kerman</a> in 1835. At the time, Kerman was held by the rebellious sons of Shuja al-Saltana, a pretender to the Qajar throne. The area was also frequently raided by the Afghans. Hasan Ali Shah managed to restore order in Kerman, as well as in <a href="Bam%2C%20Iran">Bam</a> and <a href="Narmashir">Narmashir</a>, which were also held by rebellious groups. Hasan Ali Shah sent a report of his success to Tehran, but did not receive any compensation for his achievements. Despite the service he rendered to the Qajar government, Hasan Ali Shah was dismissed from the governorship of Kerman in 1837, less than two years after his arrival there, and was replaced by Firuz Mirza Nusrat al-Dawla, a younger brother of Muhammad Shah Qajar. Refusing to accept his dismissal, Hasan Ali Shah withdrew with his forces to the <a href="Arg%20e%20Bam">citadel at Bam</a>. Along with his two brothers, he made preparations to resist the government forces that were sent against him. He was besieged at Bam for some fourteen months. When it was clear that continuing the resistance was of little use, Hasan Ali Shah sent one of his brothers to Shiraz in order to speak to the governor of Fars to intervene on his behalf and arrange for safe passage out of Kerman. With the governor having interceded, Hasan Ali Shah surrendered and emerged from the citadel of Bam only to be double-crossed. He was seized and his possessions were plundered by the government troops. Hasan Ali Shah and his dependents were sent to Kerman and remained as prisoners there for eight months. He was eventually allowed to go to Tehran near the end of 1838-39 where he was able to present his case before the Shah. The Shah pardoned him on the condition that he return peacefully to Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah remained in Mahallat for about two years. He managed to gather an army in Mahallat which alarmed Muhammad Shah, who travelled to <a href="Delijan">Delijan</a> near <a href="Mahallat">Mahallat</a> to determine the truth of the reports about Hasan Ali Shah. Hasan Ali Shah was on a hunting trip at the time, but he sent a messenger to request permission of the monarch to go to Mecca for the hajj pilgrimage. Permission was given, and Hasan Ali Shah's mother and a few relatives were sent to Najaf and other holy cities in Iraq in which the shrines of his ancestors, the Shiite Imams are found.

Prior to leaving Mahallat, Hasan Ali Shah equipped himself with letters appointing him to the governorship of Kerman. Accompanied by his brothers, nephews and other relatives, as well as many followers, he left for Yazd, where he intended to meet some of his local followers. Hasan Ali Shah sent the documents reinstating him to the position of governor of Kerman to Bahman Mirza Baha al-Dawla, the governor of Yazd. Bahman Mirza offered Hasan Ali Shah lodging in the city, but Hasan Ali Shah declined, indicating that he wished to visit his followers living around Yazd. Hajji Mirza Aqasi sent a messenger to Bahman Mirza to inform him of the spuriousness of Hasan Ali Shah's documents and a battle between Bahman Mīrzā and Hasan Ali Shah broke out in which Bahman Mirza was defeated. Other minor battles were won by Hasan Ali Shah before he arrived in <a href="Shahr-e%20Babak">Shahr-e Babak</a>, which he intended to use as his base for capturing Kerman. At the time of his arrival in Shahr-e Babak, a formal local governor was engaged in a campaign to drive out the Afghans from the city's citadel, and Hasan Ali Shah joined him in forcing the Afghans to surrender.

Soon after March 1841, Hasan Ali Shah set out for Kerman. He managed to defeat a government force consisting of 4,000 men near Dashtab, and continued to win a number of victories before stopping at Bam for a time. Soon, a government force of 24,000 men forced Hasan Ali Shah to flee from Bam to Rigan on the border of Baluchistan, where he suffered a decisive defeat. Hasan Ali Shah decided to escape to Afghanistan, accompanied by his brothers and many soldiers and servants.

Fleeing Iran, he arrived in <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, Afghanistan in 1841—a town that had been occupied by an Anglo-Indian army in 1839 in the <a href="First%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">First Anglo-Afghan War</a>. A close relationship developed between Hasan Ali Shah and the British, which coincided with the final years of the First Anglo-Afghan War (1838–1842). After his arrival, Hasan Ali Shah wrote to Sir <a href="William%20Macnaghten">William Macnaghten</a>, discussing his plans to seize and govern <a href="Herat">Herat</a> on behalf of the British. Although the proposal seemed to have been approved, the plans of the British were thwarted by the uprising of <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Barakzai">Dost Muhammad</a>'s son <a href="Wazir%20Akbar%20Khan">Muhammad Akbar Khan</a>, who defeated and annihilated the British-Indian garrison at <a href="Gandamak">Gandamak</a> on its retreat from Kabul in January 1842.

Hasan Ali Shah soon proceeded to <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>, where he rendered further services to the British. The British were able to annex Sind and for his services, Hasan Ali Shah received an annual pension of £2,000 from General <a href="Charles%20James%20Napier">Charles James Napier</a>, the British conqueror of Sindh with whom he had a good relationship.

In October 1844, Hasan Ali Shah left <a href="Sind">Sind</a> for city of <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> in <a href="Bombay%20Presidency">Bombay Presidency</a>, <a href="British%20India">British India</a> passing through <a href="Cutch%20State">Cutch</a> and <a href="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> where he spent some time visiting the communities of his followers in the area. After arriving in Bombay in February 1846, the Persian government demanded his extradition from India. The British refused and only agreed to transfer Hasan Ali Shah’s residence to <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, where it would be harder for him to launch new attacks against the Persian government. The British also negotiated the safe return of Hasan Ali Shah to Persia, which was in accordance with his own wish. The government agreed to Hasan Ali Shah's return provided that he would avoid passing through Baluchistan and Kirman and that he was to settle peacefully in Mahallat. Hasan Ali Shah was eventually forced to leave for Calcutta in April 1847, where he remained until he received news of the death of Muhammad Shah Qajar. Hasan Ali Shah left for Bombay and the British attempted to obtain permission for his return to Persia. Although some of his lands were restored to the control of his relatives, his safe return could not be arranged, and Hasan Ali Shah was forced to remain a permanent resident of India. While in India, Hasan Ali Shah continued his close relationship with the British, and was even visited by the Prince of Wales (the future King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>) when he was on a state visit to India. The British came to address Hasan Ali Shah as His Highness. Hasan Ali Shah received protection from the British government in British India as the spiritual head of an important Muslim community.

"See <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Case">Aga Khan Case</a>"

The vast majority of his <a href="Khoja">Khoja</a> Ismaili followers in India welcomed him warmly, but some dissident members, sensing their loss of prestige with the arrival of the Imam, wished to maintain control over communal properties. Because of this, Hasan Ali Shah decided to secure a pledge of loyalty from the members of the community to himself and to the Ismaili form of Islam. Although most of the members of the community signed a document issued by Hasan Ali Shah summarizing the practices of the Ismailis, a group of dissenting Khojas surprisingly asserted that the community had always been Sunni. This group was outcast by the unanimous vote of all the Khojas assembled in Bombay. In 1866, these dissenters filed a suit in the Bombay High Court against Hasan Ali Shah, claiming that the Khojas had been Sunni Muslims from the very beginning. The case, commonly referred to as the Aga Khan Case, was heard by <a href="Joseph%20Arnould">Sir Joseph Arnould</a>. The hearing lasted several weeks, and included testimony from Hasan Ali Shah himself. After reviewing the history of the community, Justice Arnould gave a definitive and detailed judgement against the plaintiffs and in favour of Hasan Ali Shah and other defendants. The judgement was significant in that it legally established the status of the Khojas as a community referred to as Shia Imami Ismailis, and of Hasan Ali Shah as the spiritual head of that community. Hasan Ali Shah's authority thereafter was not seriously challenged again.

Hasan Ali Shah spent his final years in Bombay with occasional visits to Pune. Maintaining the traditions of the Iranian nobility to which he belonged, he kept excellent stables and became a well-known figure at the Bombay racecourse. Hasan Ali Shah died after an imamate of sixty-four years in April 1881. He was buried in a specially built shrine at Hasanabad in the <a href="Mazagaon">Mazagaon</a> area of Bombay. He was survived by three sons and five daughters. Hasan Ali Shah was succeeded as Imam by his eldest son Aqa Ali Shah, who became <a href="Aga%20Khan%20II">Aga Khan II</a>.

Aga Khan III

Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, Aga Khan III (2 November 187711 July 1957) was the 48th <a href="Shia%20Imam">Imam</a> of the <a href="Nizari">Nizari Ismaili</a> community. He was one of the founders and the first president of the <a href="All-India%20Muslim%20League">All-India Muslim League</a> (AIML). His goal was the advancement of Muslim agendas and protection of Muslim rights in India. The League, until the late 1930s, was not a mass organisation but represented the landed and commercial Muslim interests of the British-ruled 'United Provinces' (today's <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>). He shared Sir <a href="Syed%20Ahmad%20Khan">Syed Ahmad Khan</a>'s belief that Muslims should first build up their <a href="social%20capital">social capital</a> through advanced education before engaging in politics. Aga Khan called on the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> to consider Muslims to be a separate nation within India, the so-called 'Two Nation Theory'. Even after he resigned as president of the AIML in 1912, he still exerted major influence on its policies and agendas. He was nominated to represent India to the League of Nations in 1932 and served as President of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> from 1937–38.

He was born in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, the capital of <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> province in British <a href="India">India</a>, (now <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>) to <a href="Aga%20Khan%20II">Aga Khan II</a> and his third wife, Nawab A'lia Shamsul-Muluk, who was a granddaughter of <a href="Fath%20Ali%20Shah">Fath Ali Shah</a> of Persia/Iran (<a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajar dynasty</a>).

Under the care of his mother, he was given not only that religious and Oriental education which his position as the religious leader of the <a href="Ismailis">Ismailis</a> made indispensable, but a sound European training, a boon denied to his father and paternal grandfather. He also attended <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>.

In 1885, at the age of eight, he succeeded his father as <a href="Shia%20Imam">Imam</a> of the <a href="Shi%27a">Shi'a</a> <a href="Isma%27ili">Isma'ili</a> Muslims.

The Aga Khan travelled in distant parts of the world to receive the homage of his followers, and with the object either of settling differences or of advancing their welfare by financial help and personal advice and guidance. The distinction of a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Indian%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Indian Empire</a> was conferred upon him by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> in 1897 (and later Knight Grand Commander in 1902 by <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>). He was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India by George V (1912). He was appointed a GCMG in 1923. He received like recognition for his public services from the German Emperor, the Sultan of Turkey, the Shah of Persia and other potentates.

In 1906, the Aga Khan was a founding member and first president of the <a href="All%20India%20Muslim%20League">All India Muslim League</a>, a political party which pushed for the creation of an independent Muslim nation in the north west regions of India, then under British colonial rule, and later established the country of Pakistan in 1947.

During the three <a href="Round%20Table%20Conferences%20%28India%29">Round Table Conferences (India)</a> in London from 1930-32, he played an important role to bring about Indian constitutional reforms. 

In 1934, he was made a member of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> and served as a member of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> (1934–37), becoming the President of the League of Nations in 1937.

Under the leadership of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, the first half of the 20th century was a period of significant development for the Ismā'īlī community. Numerous institutions for social and economic development were established in the Indian Subcontinent and in East Africa. Ismailis have marked the Jubilees of their Imāms with public celebrations, which are symbolic affirmations of the ties that link the <a href="Ism%C4%81%CA%BF%C4%ABl%C4%AB">Ismāʿīlī</a> Imām and his followers. Although the Jubilees have no religious significance, they serve to reaffirm the Imamat's worldwide commitment to the improvement of the quality of human life, especially in the developing countries.

The Jubilees of Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, Aga Khan III, are well remembered. During his 72 years of Imamat (1885–1957), the community celebrated his Golden (1937), Diamond (1946) and Platinum (1954) Jubilees. To show their appreciation and affection, the Ismā'īliyya weighed their Imam in gold, diamonds and, symbolically, in platinum, respectively, the proceeds of which were used to further develop major social welfare and development institutions in Asia and Africa.

In <a href="British%20Raj">India</a> and later in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, social development institutions were established, in the words of Aga Khan III, "for the relief of humanity". They included institutions such as the Diamond Jubilee Trust and the Platinum Jubilee Investments Limited which in turn assisted the growth of various types of cooperative societies. "Diamond Jubilee High School for Girls" were established throughout the remote Northern Areas of what is now Pakistan. In addition, scholarship programs, established at the time of the Golden Jubilee to give assistance to needy students, were progressively expanded. In East Africa, major social welfare and economic development institutions were established. Those involved in social welfare included the accelerated development of schools and community centres, and a modern, fully equipped <a href="Aga%20Khan%20University%20Hospital%2C%20Nairobi">hospital</a> in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>. Among the economic development institutions established in East Africa were companies such as the Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust (now Diamond Trust of Kenya) and the Jubilee Insurance Company, which are quoted on the Nairobi Stock Exchange and have become major players in national development.

Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah also introduced organizational forms that gave Ismāʿīlī communities the means to structure and regulate their own affairs. These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ismā'īlī Constitution for the social governance of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ismā'īlīs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.

Following the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, far-reaching social, economic and political changes profoundly affected a number of areas where Ismāʿīlīs resided. In 1947, British rule in the Indian Subcontinent was replaced by the sovereign, independent nations of <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and later <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, resulting in the migration of millions people and significant loss of life and property. In the Middle East, the <a href="Suez%20crisis">Suez crisis</a> of 1956 as well as the preceding crisis in Iran, demonstrated the sharp upsurge of nationalism, which was as assertive of the region's social and economic aspirations as of its political independence. Africa was also set on its course to <a href="decolonisation">decolonisation</a>, swept by what <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, the then British prime minister, termed the "wind of change". By the early 1960s, most of East and Central Africa, where the majority of the <a href="Ism%C4%81%CA%BF%C4%ABl%C4%AB">Ismāʿīlī</a> population on the continent resided, including <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, Rwanda, Burundi and <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a>, had attained their political independence.

He was an owner of thoroughbred racing horses, including a record equalling five winners of the <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Epsom Derby</a> (<a href="Blenheim%20%28horse%29">Blenheim</a>, <a href="Bahram%20%28horse%29">Bahram</a>, <a href="Mahmoud%20%28horse%29">Mahmoud</a>, <a href="My%20Love%20%28horse%29">My Love</a>, <a href="Tulyar%20%28horse%29">Tulyar</a>) and a total of sixteen winners of <a href="British%20Classic%20Races">British Classic Races</a>. He was <a href="British%20flat%20racing%20Champion%20Owner">British flat racing Champion Owner</a> thirteen times. According to <a href="Ben%20Pimlott">Ben Pimlott</a>, biographer of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, the Aga Khan presented Her Majesty with a <a href="filly">filly</a> called "Astrakhan", who won at <a href="Hurst%20Park%20Racecourse">Hurst Park Racecourse</a> in 1950.

In 1926, the Aga Khan gave a cup (the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Trophy">Aga Khan Trophy</a>) to be awarded to the winners of an international team <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a> competition held at the annual horse show of the <a href="Royal%20Dublin%20Society">Royal Dublin Society</a> in Dublin, Ireland every first week in August. It attracts competitors from all of the main show jumping nations and is carried live on Irish national television.


He wrote a number of books and papers two of which are of immense importance, namely (1) India in Transition, about the prepartition politics of India and (2) World Enough & Time – The Memoirs of Sir Sultan Mohammed Shah, Aga Khan III, his autobiography.

Aga Khan III was succeeded as Aga Khan by his grandson <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Karim Aga Khan</a>, who is the present <a href="Shia%20Imam">Imam</a> of the <a href="Ismaili">Ismaili</a> Muslims. At the time of his death on 11 July 1957, his family members were in <a href="Versoix">Versoix</a>. A solicitor brought the will of the Aga Khan III from London to Geneva and read it before the family:

“Ever since the time of my ancestor Ali, the first Imam, that is to say over a period of thirteen hundred years, it has always been the tradition of our family that each Imam chooses his successor at his absolute and unfettered discretion from amongst any of his descendants, whether they be sons or remote male issue and in these circumstances and in view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world in very recent years due to the great changes which have taken place including the discoveries of atomic science, I am convinced that it is in the best interest of the Shia Muslim Ismailia Community that I should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed during recent years and in the midst of the new age and who brings a new outlook on life to his office as Imam. For these reasons, I appoint my grandson Karim, the son of my own son, <a href="Prince%20Aly%20Khan">Aly Salomone Khan</a> to succeed to the title of Aga Khan and to the Imam and Pir of all Shia Ismailian followers”

He is buried in at the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Aga%20Khan">Mausoleum of Aga Khan</a>, on the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> in <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a>, Egypt. 

<a href="Pakistan%20Post">Pakistan Post</a> issued a special 'Birth Centenary of Agha Khan III' postage stamp in his honor in 1977.

<a href="Pakistan%20Post">Pakistan Post</a> again issued a postage stamp in his honor in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' series in 1990.

Alexander Agassiz

Alexander Emmanuel Rodolphe Agassiz (December 17, 1835March 27, 1910), son of <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> and stepson of <a href="Elizabeth%20Cabot%20Agassiz">Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz</a>, was an American scientist and engineer.

Agassiz was born in <a href="Neuch%C3%A2tel">Neuchâtel</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and immigrated to the United States with his father, <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis</a>, in 1849. He graduated from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1855, subsequently studying <a href="engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, and taking the degree of <a href="bachelor%20of%20science">bachelor of science</a> at the <a href="Lawrence%20scientific%20school">Lawrence scientific school</a> of the same institution in 1857; and in 1859 became an assistant in the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Survey">United States Coast Survey</a>. 
Thenceforward he became a specialist in marine <a href="ichthyology">ichthyology</a>. Agassiz was elected a Fellow of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1862. Up until the summer of 1866, Agassiz worked as an assistant in the museum of natural history that his father founded at Harvard.
<a href="E.%20J.%20Hulbert">E. J. Hulbert</a>, a friend of Agassiz's brother-in-law, <a href="Quincy%20Adams%20Shaw">Quincy Adams Shaw</a>, had discovered a rich copper lode known as the <a href="Calumet%20conglomerate">Calumet conglomerate</a> on the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a> in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Hulbert persuaded them, along with a group of friends, to purchase a controlling interest in the mines, which later became known as the <a href="Calumet%20and%20Hecla%20Mining%20Company">Calumet and Hecla Mining Company</a> based in <a href="Calumet%2C%20Michigan">Calumet, Michigan</a>. That summer, he took a trip to see the mines for himself and he afterwards became treasurer of the enterprise.

Over the winter of 1866 and early 1867, mining operations began to falter, due to the difficulty of extracting copper from the conglomerate. Hulbert had sold his interests in the mines and had moved on to other ventures. But Agassiz refused to give up hope for the mines. He returned to the mines in March 1867, with his wife and young son. At that time, Calumet was a remote settlement, virtually inaccessible during the winter and very far removed from civilization even during the summer. With insufficient supplies at the mines, Agassiz struggled to maintain order, while back in Boston, Shaw was saddled with debt and the collapse of their interests. Shaw obtained financial assistance from John Simpkins, the selling agent for the enterprise to continue operations.

Agassiz continued to live at Calumet, making gradual progress in stabilizing the mining operations, such that he was able to leave the mines under the control of a general manager and return to Boston in 1868 before winter closed navigation. The mines continued to prosper and in May 1871, several mines were consolidated to form the <a href="Calumet%20and%20Hecla%20Mining%20Company">Calumet and Hecla Mining Company</a> with Shaw as its first president. In August 1871, Shaw "retired" to the board of directors and Agassiz became president, a position he held until his death. Until the turn of the century, this company was by far the largest copper producer in the United States, many years producing over half of the total.

Agassiz was a major factor in the mine's continued success and visited the mines twice a year. He innovated by installing a giant engine, known as the Superior, which was able to lift 24 tons of rock from a depth of . He also built a railroad and dredged a channel to navigable waters. However, after a time the mines did not require his full-time, year-round, attention and he returned to his interests in natural history at Harvard. Out of his copper fortune, he gave some US$500,000 to Harvard for the museum of comparative <a href="zoology">zoology</a> and other purposes.

Shortly after the death of his father in 1873, Agassiz acquired a small peninsula in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, which features spectacular views of Narragansett Bay. Here he built a substantial house and a laboratory for use as his summer residence. The house was completed in 1875 and today is known as the <a href="Inn%20at%20Castle%20Hill">Inn at Castle Hill</a>.

In 1875, he surveyed <a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a>, Peru, examined the copper mines of Peru and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and made a collection of Peruvian antiquities for the <a href="Museum%20of%20Comparative%20Zoology">Museum of Comparative Zoology</a>, of which he was curator from 1874 to 1885. He assisted <a href="Charles%20Wyville%20Thomson">Charles Wyville Thomson</a> in the examination and classification of the collections of the 1872 <a href="Challenger%20expedition">"Challenger" Expedition</a>, and wrote the "Review of the Echini" (2 vols., 1872–1874) in the reports. Between 1877 and 1880 he took part in the three <a href="Marine%20biology%20dredge">dredging</a> expeditions of the steamer "Blake" of the Coast Survey, and presented a full account of them in two volumes (1888).

In 1896 Agassiz visited <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and inspected the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, publishing a paper on the subject in 1898.

Of Agassiz's other writings on marine zoology, most are contained in the bulletins and memoirs of the museum of comparative zoology. However, in 1865, he published with <a href="Elizabeth%20Cary%20Agassiz">Elizabeth Cary Agassiz</a>, his stepmother, "Seaside Studies in Natural History", a work at once exact and stimulating. They also published, in 1871, "Marine Animals of Massachusetts Bay".

He received the German Order <a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a> for Science and Arts in August 1902.

Agassiz served as a president of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>, which since 1913 has awarded the <a href="Alexander%20Agassiz%20Medal">Alexander Agassiz Medal</a> in his memory. He died in 1910 on board the <a href="RMS%20Adriatic%20%281907%29">RMS "Adriatic"</a> en route to New York from <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>.

He was the father of three sons – George R. Agassiz (1861–1951), Maximilian Agassiz (1866–1943) and <a href="Rodolphe%20Agassiz">Rodolphe Agassiz</a> (1871–1933).

Alexander Agassiz is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, "<a href="List%20of%20Anolis%20lizards">Anolis agassizi</a>.

Agathon

Agathon (; , "gen".: Ἀγάθωνος; BC) was an <a href="Athens">Athenian</a> tragic poet whose works have been lost. He is best known for his appearance in <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s "<a href="Symposium%20%28Plato%29">Symposium</a>," which describes the <a href="Symposium">banquet</a> given to celebrate his obtaining a prize for his first <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a> at the <a href="Lenaia">Lenaia</a> in 416. He is also a prominent character in <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>' comedy the "<a href="Thesmophoriazusae">Thesmophoriazusae</a>".

Agathon was the son of Tisamenus, and the lifelong companion of <a href="Pausanias%20%28Athenian%29">Pausanias</a>, with whom he appears in both the "Symposium" and Plato's "<a href="Protagoras%20%28dialogue%29">Protagoras</a>". Together with Pausanias, he later moved to the court of <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">Archelaus</a>, king of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>, who was recruiting playwrights; it is here that he probably died around 401 BC. Agathon introduced certain innovations into the Greek theater: <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> tells us in the "<a href="Poetics%20%28Aristotle%29">Poetics</a>" (1456a) that the characters and plot of his "<a href="Anthos%20%28play%29">Anthos</a>" were original and not, following Athenian dramatic orthodoxy, borrowed from mythological or historical subjects. Agathon was also the first playwright to write choral parts which were apparently independent from the main plot of his plays.

Agathon is portrayed by Plato as a handsome young man, well dressed, of polished manners, courted by the fashion, wealth and wisdom of Athens, and dispensing hospitality with ease and refinement. The <a href="epideictic">epideictic</a> speech in praise of love which Agathon recites in the "Symposium" is full of beautiful but artificial rhetorical expressions, and has led some scholars to believe he may have been a student of <a href="Gorgias">Gorgias</a>. In the "Symposium," Agathon is presented as the friend of the comic poet Aristophanes, but this alleged friendship did not prevent Aristophanes from harshly criticizing Agathon in at least two of his comic plays: the "Thesmophoriazousae" and the (now lost) "Gerytades". In the later play "Frogs", Aristophanes softens his criticisms, but even so it may be only for the sake of punning on Agathon's name (ἁγαθός "good") that he makes Dionysus call him a "good poet".

Agathon was also a friend of <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>, another recruit to the court of Archelaus of Macedon.

Agathon's extraordinary physical beauty is brought up repeatedly in the sources; the historian W. Rhys Roberts observes that "ὁ καλός Ἀγάθων ("ho kalos Agathon") has become almost a stereotyped phrase." The most detailed surviving description of Agathon is in the "Thesmophoriazousae," in which Agathon appears as a pale, clean-shaven young man dressed in women's clothes. Scholars are unsure how much of Aristophanes' portrayal is fact and how much mere comic invention.

After a close reading of the "Thesmophoriazousae," the historian Jane McIntosh Snyder observed that Agathon's costume was almost identical to that of the famous lyric poet <a href="Anacreon">Anacreon</a>, as he is portrayed in early 5th-century vase-paintings. Snyder theorizes that Agathon might have made a deliberate effort to mimic the sumptuous attire of his famous fellow-poet, although by Agathon's time, such clothing, especially the κεκρύφαλος ("kekryphalos", an elaborate covering for the hair) had long fallen out of fashion for men. According to this interpretation, Agathon is mocked in the "Thesmophoriazousae" not only for his notorious effeminacy, but also for the pretentiousness of his dress: "he seems to think of himself, in all his elegant finery, as a rival to the old Ionian poets, perhaps even to Anacreon himself."

Agathon has been thought to be the subject of "Lovers' Lips", an <a href="Epigrams%20%28Plato%29">epigram</a> attributed to Plato:

Another translation reads:

Although the authenticity of this epigram was accepted for many centuries, it was probably not composed for Agathon the tragedian, nor was it composed by Plato. Stylistic evidence suggests that the poem (with most of Plato's other alleged epigrams) was actually written some time after Plato had died: its form is that of the Hellenistic erotic epigram, which did not become popular until after 300 BC. According to 20th-century scholar Walther Ludwig, the poems were spuriously inserted into an early biography of Plato sometime between 250 BC and 100 BC and adopted by later writers from this source.

Of Agathon's plays, only six titles and thirty-one fragments have survived:
Fragments in <a href="Johann%20August%20Nauck">A Nauck</a>, "Tragicorum graecorum fragmenta" (1887).

<doc id="1550" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1550" title="Agesilaus II">
Agesilaus II

Agesilaus II (; "Agesilaos"; c. 444 – c. 360 BC), was a <a href="Eurypontid">Eurypontid</a> king of the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> city-state of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, ruling from 398 to about 360 BC, during most of which time he was, in <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s words, "as good as though commander and king of all Greece," and was for the whole of it greatly identified with his country's deeds and fortunes. Small in stature and lame from birth, Agesilaus became ruler somewhat unexpectedly in his mid-forties. His reign saw successful military incursions into various states in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, as well as successes in the <a href="Corinthian%20War">Corinthian War</a>; however, several diplomatic decisions resulted in Sparta becoming increasingly isolated prior to his death at the age of 84 in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>.

He was greatly admired by his friend, the historian <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, who wrote a minor work about him titled "<a href="Agesilaus%20%28Xenophon%29">Agesilaus</a>".

Agesilaus was the son of <a href="Archidamus%20II">Archidamus II</a> and his second wife, Eupoleia, brother to <a href="Cynisca">Cynisca</a> (the first woman in ancient history to achieve an <a href="ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic victory</a>), and younger half-brother of <a href="Agis%20II">Agis II</a>.

There is little surviving detail on the youth of Agesilaus. Born with one leg shorter, he was not expected to succeed to the throne after his brother king <a href="Agis%20II">Agis II</a>, especially because the latter had a son (<a href="Leotychidas%2C%20son%20of%20Agis">Leotychidas</a>). Therefore, Agesilaus was trained in the traditional curriculum of Sparta, the "<a href="agoge">agoge</a>." However, Leotychidas was ultimately set aside as illegitimate (contemporary rumors representing him as the son of <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>) and Agesilaus became king in 398 BC, at the age of about forty. In addition to questions of his nephew's paternity, Agesilaus' succession was largely due to the intervention of the Spartan general, <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a>, who hoped to find in him a willing tool for the furtherance of his political designs. <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a> and the young Agesilaus came to maintain an intimate relation (see <a href="Pederasty%20in%20Ancient%20Greece">Pederasty in Ancient Greece</a>), as was common of the period. Their unique relationship would serve an important role during Agesilaus' later campaigns in Asia Minor.

Agesilaus is first recorded as king during the suppression of the <a href="conspiracy%20of%20Cinadon">conspiracy of Cinadon</a>, shortly after 398 BC. Then, in 396 BC, Agesilaus crossed into Asia with a force of 2,000 <a href="neodamodes">neodamodes</a> (freed <a href="helots">helots</a>) and 6,000 allies (including 30 Spartiates) to liberate <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> cities from <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> dominion. On the eve of sailing from <a href="Aulis%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Aulis</a> he attempted to offer a sacrifice, as <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> had done before the <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> expedition, but the <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebans</a> intervened to prevent it, an insult for which he never forgave them. On his arrival at <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> a three months' truce was concluded with <a href="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</a>, the <a href="satrap">satrap</a> of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> and <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, but negotiations conducted during that time proved fruitless, and on its termination Agesilaus raided <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, where he easily won immense booty from the satrap <a href="Pharnabazus%20%285th%20century%20BC%29">Pharnabazus</a>; Tissaphernes could offer no assistance, as he had concentrated his troops in Caria. In these campaigns Agesilaus also benefited from the aid of the <a href="Ten%20Thousand">Ten Thousand</a> (a mercenary army), who marched through miles of Persian territory to reach the Black Sea. After spending the winter organizing a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> force ("<a href="hippeis">hippeis</a>"), he made a successful incursion into <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> in the spring of 395 BC. <a href="Tithraustes">Tithraustes</a> was sent to replace Tissaphernes, who paid with his life for his continued failure. An armistice was concluded between Tithraustes and Agesilaus, who left the southern <a href="satrap">satrap</a>y and again invaded <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>, which he ravaged until the following spring. He then came to an agreement with Pharnabazus and once more turned southward.

During these campaigns, <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a> attempted to manipulate Agesilaus into ceding his authority. Agesilaus, the former passive lover of Lysander, would have nothing of this, and reminded Lysander (who was only a Spartan general) who was king. He had Lysander sent away to assist the naval campaigns in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>. This dominating move by Agesilaus earned the respect of his men-at-arms and of Lysander himself, who remained emotionally close with Agesilaus.

In 394 BC, while encamped on the <a href="plain%20of%20Thebe">plain of Thebe</a>, he was planning a campaign in the interior, or even an attack on <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II</a> himself, when he was recalled to <a href="Greece">Greece</a> to fight in the <a href="Corinthian%20War">Corinthian War</a> between <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> and the combined forces of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, <a href="Corinth%2C%20Greece">Corinth</a>, <a href="Argos">Argos</a> and several minor states. (The outbreak of the conflict had been encouraged by Persian payments to Sparta's Greek rivals.) A rapid march through <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ia brought him to <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, where he repulsed the Thessalian cavalry who tried to impede him. Reinforced by <a href="Phocis">Phocian</a> and <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenian</a> troops and a Spartan army, he met the confederate forces at <a href="Coronea">Coronea</a> in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> and in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronea%20%28394%20BC%29">hotly contested battle</a> was technically victorious. However, the Spartan baggage train was ransacked and Agesilaus himself was injured during the fighting, resulting in a subsequent retreat by way of <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> to the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. Shortly before this battle the Spartan <a href="navy">navy</a>, of which he had received the supreme command, was totally defeated off <a href="Knidos">Cnidus</a> by a powerful Persian fleet under <a href="Conon">Conon</a> and <a href="Pharnabazus%20%285th%20century%20BC%29">Pharnabazus</a>.

During these conflicts in mainland Greece, <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a> perished while attacking the walls of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>. <a href="Pausanias%20II%20of%20Sparta">Pausanias</a>, the second king of Sparta (see <a href="Spartan%20Constitution">Spartan Constitution</a> for more information on Sparta's dual monarchy), was supposed to provide Lysander with reinforcements as they marched into <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>, yet failed to arrive in time to assist Lysander, likely because Pausanias disliked him for his brash and arrogant attitude towards the Spartan royalty and government. Pausanias failed to fight for the bodies of the dead, and because he retrieved the bodies under truce (a sign of defeat), he was disgraced and banished from Sparta.

In 393 BC, Agesilaus engaged in a ravaging invasion of <a href="Argolis">Argolis</a>. In 392 BC he made several successful expeditions into Corinthian territory, capturing <a href="Lechaeum">Lechaeum</a> and <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>. The loss, however, of a battalion (mora), destroyed by <a href="Iphicrates">Iphicrates</a>, neutralized these successes, and Agesilaus returned to Sparta. In 389 BC he conducted a campaign in <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>, but two years later the <a href="Peace%20of%20Antalcidas">Peace of Antalcidas</a>, warmly supported by Agesilaus, put an end to the war, maintaining Spartan hegemony over Greece. In this interval, Agesilaus declined command over Sparta's aggression on <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a>, and justified <a href="Phoebidas">Phoebidas</a>' seizure of the Theban <a href="Cadmea">Cadmea</a> so long as the outcome provided glory to Sparta.

When war broke out afresh with Thebes, Agesilaus twice invaded <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> (in 378 BC and 377 BC), although he spent the next five years largely out of action due to an unspecified but apparently grave illness. In the congress of 371 BC an altercation is recorded between him and the Theban general <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a>, and due to his influence, Thebes was peremptorily excluded from the peace, and orders given for <a href="Cleombrotus%20I">Cleombrotus</a> to march against Thebes in 371 BC. Cleombrotus was defeated at <a href="Leuctra">Leuctra</a> and the Spartan supremacy overthrown.

In 370 BC Agesilaus was engaged in an embassy to <a href="Mantineia">Mantineia</a>, and reassured the Spartans with an invasion of <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>. He preserved an un-walled Sparta against the revolts and conspiracies of <a href="helot">helot</a>s, <a href="perioeci">perioeci</a> and even other Spartans; and against external enemies, with four different armies led by <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a> penetrating <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> that same year. Again, in 362 BC, Epaminondas almost succeeded in seizing the city with a rapid and unexpected march. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Mantinea%20%28362%20BC%29">Battle of Mantinea</a>, in which Agesilaus took no part, was followed by a general peace: Sparta, however, stood aloof, hoping even yet to recover her supremacy. According to <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, Agesilaus, in order to gain money for prosecuting the war, supported the <a href="satrap">satrap</a> <a href="Ariobarzanes%20II%20of%20Cius">Ariobarzanes II</a> in his revolt against <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II</a> in 364 BC (<a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Satraps">Revolt of the Satraps</a>), and in 361 BC he went to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> at the head of a <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> force to aid the king <a href="Nectanebo%20I">Nectanebo I</a> and his regent <a href="Teos%20of%20Egypt">Teos</a> against Persia. He soon transferred his services to Teos's cousin and rival <a href="Nectanebo%20II">Nectanebo II</a>, who, in return for his help, gave him a sum of over 200 <a href="attic%20talent">talents</a>. On his way home Agesilaus died in <a href="Cyrenaica">Cyrenaica</a>, around the age of 84, after a reign of some 41 years. His body was embalmed in wax, and buried at Sparta.

He was succeeded by his son <a href="Archidamus%20III">Archidamus III</a>.

Agesilaus was of small stature and unimpressive appearance, and was lame from birth. These facts were used as an argument against his succession, an <a href="oracle">oracle</a> having warned Sparta against a "lame reign." Most ancient writers considered him a highly successful leader in <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, alert and quick, yet cautious—a man, moreover, whose personal bravery was rarely questioned in his own time. Of his courage, temperance, and hardiness, many instances are cited: and to these were added the less Spartan qualities of kindliness and tenderness as a father and a friend. As examples: there is the story of his riding a stick-horse with his children and upon being discovered by a friend desiring that he not mention till he himself were the father of children; and because of the affection of his son <a href="Archidamus%20III">Archidamus</a>' for <a href="Cleonymus%2C%20son%20of%20Sphodrias">Cleonymus</a>, he saved <a href="Sphodrias">Sphodrias</a>, Cleonymus' father, from execution for his incursion into the <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, and dishonorable retreat, in 378 BC. Modern writers tend to be slightly more critical of Agesilaus' reputation and achievements, reckoning him an excellent soldier, but one who had a poor understanding of sea power and <a href="siegecraft">siegecraft</a>.

As a statesman he won himself both enthusiastic adherents and bitter enemies. Agesilaus was most successful in the opening and closing periods of his reign: commencing but then surrendering a glorious career in Asia; and in extreme age, maintaining his prostrate country. Other writers acknowledge his extremely high popularity at home, but suggest his occasionally rigid and arguably irrational political loyalties and convictions contributed greatly to Spartan decline, notably his unremitting hatred of Thebes, which led to Sparta's humiliation at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuctra">Battle of Leuctra</a> and thus the end of Spartan hegemony. Historian J. B. Bury remarks that "there is something melancholy about his career:" born into a Sparta that was was the unquestioned continental power of Hellas, the Sparta which mourned him eighty four years later had suffered a series of military defeats which would have been unthinkable to his forbears, had seen its population severely decline, and had run so short of money that its soldiers were increasingly sent on campaigns fought more for money than for defense or glory.

Other historical accounts paint Agesilaus as a prototype for the ideal leader. His awareness, thoughtfulness, and wisdom were all traits to be emulated diplomatically, while his bravery and shrewdness in battle epitomized the heroic Greek commander. These historians point towards the unstable oligarchies established by Lysander in the former Athenian Empire and the failures of Spartan leaders (such as Pausanias and Kleombrotos) for the eventually suppression of Spartan power. The ancient historian <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> was a huge admirer and served under Agesilaus during the campaigns into <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>.

<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> includes among his 78 essays and speeches comprising the <a href="Apophthegmata%20Laconica">apophthegmata</a> Agesilaus' letter to the <a href="ephor">ephor</a>s on his recall:
And when asked whether he wanted a memorial erected in his honor:

He lived in the most frugal style alike at home and in the field, and though his campaigns were undertaken largely to secure booty, he was content to enrich the state and his friends and to return as poor as he had set forth.

When someone was praising an orator for his ability to magnify small points, he said, "In my opinion it's not a good cobbler who fits large shoes on small feet."

Another time he watched a mouse being pulled from its hole by a small boy. When the mouse turned around, bit the hand of its captor and escaped, he pointed this out to those present and said, "When the tiniest creature defends itself like this against aggressors, what ought men to do, do you reckon?"

Certainly when somebody asked what gain the laws of <a href="Lycurgus%20of%20Sparta">Lycurgus</a> had brought Sparta, he answered, "Contempt for pleasures."

Asked once how far Sparta's boundaries stretched, he brandished his spear and said, "As far as this can reach."

On noticing a house in Asia roofed with square beams, he asked the owner whether timber grew square in that area. When told no, it grew round, he said, "What then? If it were square, would you make it round?"

Invited to hear an actor who could perfectly imitate the <a href="nightingale">nightingale</a>, Agesilaus declined, saying he had heard the nightingale itself.

Agrippina the Elder

Vipsania Agrippina, most commonly known as Agrippina Major or Agrippina the Elder ("Major" Latin for "the elder", <a href="Classical%20Latin">Classical Latin</a>: , 14 BC – 17 October AD 33), was a distinguished and prominent <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> woman of the first century. Agrippina was the wife of the general and statesman <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a> and a relative to the <a href="Julio-Claudian%20dynasty">first</a> <a href="Roman%20Emperors">Roman Emperors</a>.

She was the second granddaughter of the Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law of the Emperor <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, mother of the Emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a>, maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of the Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> and the maternal grandmother of the Emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a>.

Agrippina was born as the second daughter and fourth child to Roman statesman and Augustus’ ally <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a> and <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia the Elder</a>. Agrippina’s mother Julia was the only natural child born to Augustus from his second marriage to noblewoman <a href="Scribonia">Scribonia</a>.

Her father’s marriage to Julia was his third marriage. From Agrippa’s previous two marriages, Agrippina had at least two half-sisters: <a href="Vipsania%20Agrippina">Vipsania Agrippina</a> and <a href="Vipsania%20Marcella">Vipsania Marcella</a> Agrippina (although Suet. "Div. Aug." 63 implies more). Vipsania Agrippina was Agrippa’s second child from his first marriage to <a href="Pomponia%20Caecilia%20Attica">Pomponia Caecilia Attica</a> (known from Nep. "Att." 19.) She became Tiberius's first wife and was the mother of his natural son <a href="Drusus%20Julius%20Caesar">Drusus Julius Caesar</a>.

Vipsania Agrippina later married senator and consul <a href="Gaius%20Asinius%20Gallus%20Saloninus">Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus</a> after Tiberius was forced to divorce her and marry <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia the Elder</a>. Less well known is Agrippa’s oldest daughter - Vipsania Marcella. She was the first wife <a href="Publius%20Quinctilius%20Varus">Publius Quinctilius Varus</a>. Agrippa likely had more children, some of whom did not survive, from his second marriage to Augustus’ niece and (paternal) cousin to Julia the Elder, <a href="Claudia%20Marcella">Claudia Marcella</a> Major. No son is attested, but a daughter is possibly the mother of Dec. Haterius Agrippa (cos. AD 22, called a relative of Germanicus by Tac. "Ann." 2.49).

Her mother’s marriage to Agrippa was her second marriage, as Julia the Elder was widowed from her first marriage, to her paternal cousin <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus%20%28Julio-Claudian%20dynasty%29">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> and they had no children. From the marriage of Julia and Agrippa, Agrippina had four full-blood siblings: a sister <a href="Julia%20the%20Younger">Julia the Younger</a> and three brothers: <a href="Gaius%20Caesar">Gaius Caesar</a>, <a href="Lucius%20Caesar">Lucius Caesar</a> and <a href="Agrippa%20Postumus">Agrippa Postumus</a>. Agrippina was born in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, as in the year of her birth Agrippa was in that city completing official duties on behalf of Augustus. Her mother and her siblings had traveled with Agrippa. Later Agrippina’s family returned to <a href="Rome">Rome</a>.

In 12 BC, Agrippina’s father died. Augustus had forced his first stepson Tiberius to end his happy first marriage to Vipsania Agrippina to marry Julia the Elder. The marriage of Julia and Tiberius was not a happy one. In 2 BC Augustus exiled Agrippina’s mother on the grounds that she had committed adultery, thereby causing a major scandal. Julia was banished for her remaining years and Agrippina never saw her again. Tiberius had left Rome for the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> island of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> ca. 6 BC allegedly to avoid any scandal. In his absence, Augustus arranged the divorce between Tiberius and Julia and sent word of it to Rhodes.

With her siblings, Agrippina was raised in Rome by her maternal grandfather and maternal step-grandmother <a href="Livia">Livia</a> Drusilla. Livia was the first Roman Empress and was Augustus’ second (or third) wife (Augustus briefly had a child bride). Livia had two sons by her first marriage to praetor <a href="Tiberius%20Nero">Tiberius Nero</a>: the future emperor Tiberius and the general <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Nero Claudius Drusus</a>.

According to <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>, as a member of the imperial family, Agrippina was expected to display frugality, chastity and domesticity, all traditional virtues for a noble Roman woman. Agrippina and Augustus had a close relationship.

Between 1 BC and AD 5, Agrippina married her second maternal cousin Germanicus was the first son born to <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a> and <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Nero Claudius Drusus</a>. Antonia Minor was the second daughter born to <a href="Octavia%20Minor">Octavia Minor</a> and triumvir <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, hence Antonia’s maternal uncle was Augustus. Germanicus was a popular general and politician. Augustus ordered Tiberius to adopt Germanicus as his son and heir. Germanicus was always favored by his great uncle and hoped that he would succeed Tiberius, who had been adopted by Augustus as his heir and successor. Agrippina and Germanicus were devoted to each other. She was a loyal, affectionate wife, who supported her husband. The Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> states that Agrippina had an ‘impressive record as wife and mother’.

Agrippina and Germanicus in their union had nine children, of whom three died young. The six children who survived to adulthood were the sons: <a href="Nero%20Julius%20Caesar">Nero Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="Drusus%20Caesar">Drusus Caesar</a> and <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> (Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus) and the daughters <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Younger">Agrippina the Younger</a> (Julia Agrippina), <a href="Drusilla%20%28sister%20of%20Caligula%29">Julia Drusilla</a> and <a href="Julia%20Livilla">Julia Livilla</a>. Caligula would become future Roman Emperor. Agrippina the Younger would become a future Roman Empress and mother to the later Emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a>. Their children were born at various places throughout the Roman Empire and Agrippina acquired a well-deserved reputation for successful childbearing. Eventually Agrippina was proud of her large family and this was a part of the reason she was popular with Roman citizens.

According to Suetonius who had cited from <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, Agrippina had borne to Germanicus, a son called Gaius Julius Caesar who had a lovable character. This son died young. The child was born at Treveri, near the village of Ambitarvium, just before the junction of the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle River</a> and the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> River (modern <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, Germany). At this spot, there were local altars inscribed as a dedication to Agrippina: “IN HONOR OF AGRIPPINA’S <a href="puerperium">PUERPERIUM</a>”.

Germanicus was a candidate for future succession and had won fame campaigning in <a href="Germania">Germania</a> and <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. During the military campaigns, Agrippina accompanied Germanicus with their children. Agrippina’s actions were considered unusual as for a Roman wife, because a conventional Roman wife was required to stay home. Agrippina had earned herself a reputation as a heroic woman and wife. During her time in Germania, Agrippina had proved herself to be an efficient and effective diplomat. Agrippina had reminded Germanicus on occasion of his relation to Augustus.

A few months before Augustus’ death in 14, the emperor wrote and sent a letter to Agrippina mentioning a child who must be future emperor Caligula because at that time, no other child had this name.

The letter reads:

Agrippina and Germanicus travelled to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> in 19, incurring the displeasure of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>. Germanicus quarreled with <a href="Gnaeus%20Calpurnius%20Piso">Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso</a>, the governor of <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a> and died in <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in mysterious circumstances. It was widely suspected that Germanicus had been poisoned, perhaps on the orders of Tiberius, with Agrippina believing he was assassinated. Agrippina was in grief when Germanicus died. She returned with her children to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> with Germanicus’ ashes. The Roman citizens had great sympathy for Agrippina and her family. She returned to Rome to avenge his death and boldly accused Piso of the murder of Germanicus. According to Tacitus ("Annals" 3.14.1), the prosecution could not prove the poisoning charge, but other charges of treason seemed likely to stick and Piso committed suicide.

From 19 to 29, Agrippina lived on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a> in Rome. Her remaining children were raised between her, <a href="Livia">Livia</a> Drusilla and Germanicus’ mother <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a>. Agrippina had become lonely, distressed, physically ill and many of her relatives had died. Agrippina had a hasty, uncomfortable relationship with Tiberius and possibly with Tiberius’ mother Livia. She became involved in politics in Tiberius’ imperial court, became an advocate for her sons to succeed Tiberius, and opposed Tiberius’ natural son and natural grandson <a href="Tiberius%20Gemellus">Tiberius Gemellus</a> for succession.

She was unwise in her complaints about Germanicus’ death to Tiberius. Tiberius took Agrippina by her hand and quoted the Greek line: “And if you are not queen, my dear, have I then done you wrong?”

Agrippina became involved in a group of Roman Senators who opposed the growing power and influence of the notorious <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> Lucius Aelius <a href="Sejanus">Sejanus</a>. Tiberius began to distrust Agrippina. In 26, Agrippina requested Tiberius to allow her to marry her brother-in-law, Roman Senator Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus. However, Tiberius didn’t allow her to marry Saloninus, because of political implications the marriage could have.

Tiberius carefully staged to invite Agrippina to dinner at the imperial palace. At dinner, Tiberius offered Agrippina an apple as a test of Agrippina’s feelings for the emperor. Agrippina had suspected that the apple could be poisoned and refused to taste the apple. This was the last time that Tiberius invited Agrippina to his dinner table. Agrippina later stated that Tiberius tried to poison her.
In 29, Agrippina and her sons <a href="Nero%20%28son%20of%20Germanicus%29">Nero</a> and <a href="Drusus%20Caesar">Drusus</a>, were arrested on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius falsely accused Agrippina of planning to take sanctuary besides the image of Augustus or with the Roman Army abroad. Agrippina and her sons were put on trial by the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>. She was banished on Tiberius’ orders to the island of Pandataria (now called <a href="Ventotene">Ventotene</a>) in the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a> off the coast of <a href="Campania">Campania</a>. This was the island where her mother was banished.

In prison at Pandataria, Agrippina protested violently. On one occasion, Tiberius ordered a guard to <a href="Flagellation">flog</a> her. During the flogging Agrippina would lose an eye. Refusing to eat, Agrippina was force-fed but later starved herself to death. Tacitus however leaves open the possibility that she was deprived of nourishment while in prison and her death was not voluntary. S died on 17 October 33. Agrippina’s son Drusus died of starvation while imprisoned in Rome and Nero committed suicide soon after the trial. The notorious guard Sejanus was murdered in 31 on the orders of Tiberius. Tiberius suspected Sejanus of plotting to overthrow the emperor.

After her death, Tiberius slandered her name and had the senate declare that her birth date was a date of bad <a href="omen">omen</a>.

In March 37, Tiberius died and Agrippina’s remaining son Caligula succeeded as emperor. After Caligula delivered Tiberius’ eulogy, Caligula sailed to Pandataria and the <a href="Pontine%20Islands">Pontine Islands</a> and returned with the ashes of his mother and brother Nero. Caligula returned with their ashes in urns in his own hands.

As proof of devotion to his family, Caligula arranged the most distinguished soldiers available to carry the urns of his mother and two brothers in two biers at noon in Rome, when the streets were at their busiest, to the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">Mausoleum of Augustus</a>. A bronze medal on display in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> shows Agrippina’s ashes being brought back to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> by Caligula.

Gaius (Caligula) had a posthumous sestertius (bronze coin) struck of his mother Agrippina the Elder, minted at Rome probably in 40-1 AD. The portrait is of Agrippina's draped bust right, wearing her hair in a long plait. The text reads AGRIPPINA M F MAT C CAESARIS AVGVSTI. On the reverse, a covered carriage or carpentum with the legend SPQR MEMORIAE AGRIPPINAE.

Caligula appointed an annual day each year in Rome, for people to offer funeral sacrifices to honor their late relatives. As a dedication to Agrippina, Caligula set aside the Circus Games to honor the memory of his late mother. On the day that the Circus Games occurred, Caligula had a statue made of Agrippina’s image to be paraded in a covered carriage at the Games.

After the Circus Games, Caligula ordered written evidence of the court cases from Tiberius’ treason trials to be brought to the Forum to be burnt, first being the cases of Agrippina and her two sons.

According to Suetonius, Caligula nursed a rumor that Augustus and Julia the Elder had an incestuous union from which Agrippina the Elder had been born. According to Tacitus, Agrippina’s eldest daughter <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Younger">Agrippina the Younger</a> had written memoirs for posterity. One memoir was an account of her mother’s life. A second memoir was about the fortunes of her mother’s family and the last memoir recorded the misfortunes (casus suorum) of the family of Agrippina and Germanicus. Unfortunately these memoirs are now lost.

Agrippina is regarded in ancient and modern historical sources as a Roman Matron with a reputation as a great woman, who had an excellent character and had outstanding Roman morals. She was a dedicated, supporting wife and mother who looked out for the interests of her children and the future of her family.

Her personality and conduct did however receive a certain amount of criticism. Her practice of accompanying Germanicus on campaigns was considered inappropriate, and her tendency to take command in these situations was viewed with suspicion as subversively masculine. Tacitus described her as “determined and rather excitable” - "Agrippina knew no feminine weaknesses. Intolerant of rivalry, thirsting for power, she had a man's preoccupations". Throughout her life, Agrippina always prized her descent from Augustus, upbraiding Tiberius for persecuting the blood of his predecessor; Tacitus, in writing of the occasion, believed this behaviour to be part of the beginning of "the chain of events leading to Agrippina's end."

She was the first Roman woman of the Roman Empire to have travelled with her husband to Roman military campaigns; to support and live with the Roman Legions. Agrippina was the first Roman matron to have more than one child from her family to reign on the Roman throne. Apart from being the late maternal grandmother of Nero, she was the late paternal grandmother of Princess <a href="Julia%20Drusilla%20%28daughter%20of%20Caligula%29">Julia Drusilla</a>, the child of Caligula. Through Nero, Agrippina was the paternal great-grandmother of <a href="Claudia%20Augusta">Claudia Augusta</a>, (Nero's only child through his second marriage to <a href="Poppaea%20Sabina">Poppaea Sabina</a>).

From the memoirs written by Agrippina the Younger, <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> used the memoirs to extract information regarding the family and fate of Agrippina the Elder, when Tacitus was writing The Annals. There is a surviving portrait of Agrippina the Elder in the <a href="Capitoline%20Museums">Capitoline Museums</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>.

Agrippina is a featured figure on <a href="Judy%20Chicago">Judy Chicago</a>'s installation piece "<a href="The%20Dinner%20Party">The Dinner Party</a>", being represented as one of the 999 names on the "<a href="List%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Heritage%20Floor">Heritage Floor</a>."

Agrippina the Younger

Julia Agrippina, most commonly referred to as Agrippina Minor or Agrippina the Younger, and after AD 50 known as Julia Augusta Agrippina ("Minor"; <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for the "younger"; 6 November 15 – 19/23 March 59), was a Roman Empress and one of the more prominent women in the <a href="Julio-Claudian%20dynasty">Julio-Claudian dynasty</a>. She was a great-granddaughter of the Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, great-niece and adoptive granddaughter of the Emperor <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>, sister of the Emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a>, niece and fourth wife of the Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>, and mother of the Emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a>.

Agrippina the Younger has been described by ancient sources and modern scholars as ruthless, ambitious, violent, and domineering. She was a beautiful and reputable woman and according to <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, she had a double canine in her upper right jaw, a sign of good fortune. Many ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Emperor Claudius, though accounts vary.

Agrippina was the first daughter and fourth living child of <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Elder">Agrippina the Elder</a> and <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a>. She had three elder brothers, <a href="Nero%20%28son%20of%20Germanicus%29">Nero Caesar</a>, <a href="Drusus%20Caesar">Drusus Caesar</a> and the future Emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a>, and two younger sisters, <a href="Julia%20Drusilla">Julia Drusilla</a> and <a href="Julia%20Livilla">Julia Livilla</a>. Agrippina's two elder brothers and her mother were victims of the intrigues of the Praetorian Prefect <a href="Lucius%20Aelius%20Sejanus">Lucius Aelius Sejanus</a>.

She was the namesake of her mother. Agrippina the Elder was remembered as a modest and heroic matron, who was the second daughter and fourth child of <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia the Elder</a> and the statesman <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a>. The father of Julia the Elder was the Emperor <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, and Julia was his only natural child from his second marriage to <a href="Scribonia">Scribonia</a>, who had close blood relations with <a href="Pompey%20the%20Great">Pompey the Great</a> and <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a>. Maternally, Agrippina descended directly from Augustus.

Germanicus, Agrippina's father, was a very popular general and politician. His mother was <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a> and his father was the general <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Nero Claudius Drusus</a>. He was Antonia Minor's first child. Germanicus had two younger siblings; a sister, named <a href="Livilla%20%28sister%20of%20Claudius%29">Livilla</a>, and a brother, the future Emperor <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>. Claudius was Agrippina's paternal uncle and third husband.

Antonia Minor was a daughter to <a href="Octavia%20the%20Younger">Octavia the Younger</a> by her second marriage to triumvir <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and Octavia was the second eldest sister and full-blooded sister of Augustus. Germanicus' father, <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Drusus the Elder</a>, was the second son of the Empress <a href="Livia">Livia</a> Drusilla by her first marriage to praetor <a href="Tiberius%20Nero">Tiberius Nero</a>, and was the Emperor <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>'s younger brother and Augustus's stepson. In the year 9, Augustus ordered and forced Tiberius to adopt Germanicus, who happened to be Tiberius's nephew, as his son and heir. Germanicus was a favorite of his great-uncle Augustus, who hoped that Germanicus would succeed his uncle Tiberius, who was Augustus's own adopted son and heir. This in turn meant that Tiberius was also Agrippina's adoptive grandfather in addition to her paternal great-uncle.

Agrippina was born on 6 November AD 15 or possibly 14, at Oppidum Ubiorum, a Roman outpost on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> River located in present-day <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. A second sister Julia <a href="Drusilla">Drusilla</a> was born on 16 September AD 16, also in Germany. As a small child, Agrippina travelled with her parents throughout Germany (AD 15-16) until she and her siblings (apart from Caligula) returned to Rome to live with and be raised by their maternal grandmother Antonia. Her parents departed for <a href="Syria">Syria</a> in AD 18 to conduct official duties, and, according to Tacitus, the third and youngest sister was born en route on the island of Lesbos, namely <a href="Julia%20Livilla">Julia Livilla</a>, probably in March AD 18. In October AD 19, Germanicus died suddenly in <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> (modern <a href="Antakya">Antakya</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>).

Germanicus' death caused much public grief in Rome, and gave rise to rumors that he had been <a href="murder">murder</a>ed by <a href="Gnaeus%20Calpurnius%20Piso">Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso</a> and <a href="Munatia%20Plancina">Munatia Plancina</a> on the orders of Tiberius, as his widow Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with his ashes. Agrippina the Younger was thereafter supervised by her mother, her paternal grandmother Antonia Minor, and her great-grandmother, <a href="Livia">Livia</a>, all of them notable, influential, and powerful figures from whom she learnt how to survive. She lived on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Her great-uncle Tiberius had already become emperor and the head of the family after the death of Augustus in 14.

After her thirteenth birthday in 28, Tiberius arranged for Agrippina to marry her paternal first cousin once removed <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Ahenobarbus%20%28consul%2032%29">Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus</a> and ordered the marriage to be celebrated in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Domitius came from a distinguished family of <a href="Ahenobarbus">consular rank</a>. Through his mother <a href="Antonia%20Major">Antonia Major</a>, Domitius was a great nephew of Augustus, first cousin to Claudius, and first cousin once removed to Agrippina and Caligula. He had two sisters; <a href="Domitia%20Lepida%20the%20Elder">Domitia Lepida the Elder</a> and <a href="Domitia%20Lepida%20the%20Younger">Domitia Lepida the Younger</a>. Domitia Lepida the Younger was the mother of the Empress <a href="Valeria%20Messalina">Valeria Messalina</a>.

Antonia Major was the elder sister to Antonia Minor, and the first daughter of Octavia Minor and Mark Antony. According to Suetonius, Domitius was a wealthy man with a despicable and dishonest character, who, according to Suetonius, was "a man who was in every aspect of his life detestable" and served as consul in 32. Agrippina and Domitius lived between <a href="Antium">Antium</a> (modern <a href="Anzio">Anzio</a> and <a href="Nettuno">Nettuno</a>) and Rome. Not much is known about the relationship between them.

Tiberius died on March 16, 37, and Agrippina's only surviving brother, <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a>, became the new emperor. Being the emperor's sister gave Agrippina some influence.

Agrippina and her younger sisters <a href="Drusilla%20%28sister%20of%20Caligula%29">Julia Drusilla</a> and <a href="Livilla%20%28sister%20of%20Caligula%29">Julia Livilla</a> received various honours from their brother, which included but were not limited to:


Around the time that Tiberius died, Agrippina had become pregnant. Domitius had acknowledged the paternity of the child. In the early morning hours in Antium of December 15, 37, Agrippina gave birth to a son. Agrippina and Domitius named their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, after the Domitius' recently deceased father. This child would grow up to become the Emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a>. Nero was Agrippina's only natural child. Suetonius states that Domitius was congratulated by friends on the birth of his son, whereupon he replied "I don't think anything produced by me and Agrippina could possibly be good for the state or the people".

Caligula and his sisters were accused of having incestuous relationships. On June 10, 38, Drusilla died, possibly of a fever, rampant in Rome at the time. He was particularly fond of Drusilla, claiming to treat her as he would <a href="Lollia%20Paulina">his own wife</a>, even though Drusilla had a <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28executed%2039%29">husband</a>. Following her death Caligula showed no special love or respect toward the surviving sisters and was said to have gone insane.

In 39, Agrippina and Livilla, with their maternal cousin, Drusilla's widower <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28executed%2039%29">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a>, were involved in a failed plot to murder Caligula, a plot known as the "Plot of the Three Daggers", which was to make Lepidus the new emperor. Lepidus, Agrippina and Livilla were accused of being lovers. Not much is known concerning this plot and the reasons behind it. At the trial of Lepidus, Caligula felt no compunction about denouncing them as adulteresses, producing handwritten letters discussing how they were going to kill him.

Lepidus was executed. Agrippina and Livilla were exiled by their brother to the <a href="Pontine%20Islands">Pontine Islands</a>. Caligula sold their furniture, jewellery, slaves and freedmen. In January 40 Domitius died of <a href="edema">edema</a> (dropsy) at Pyrgi. Lucius had gone to live with his second paternal aunt <a href="Domitia%20Lepida%20the%20Younger">Domitia Lepida the Younger</a> after Caligula had taken his inheritance away from him.

Caligula, his wife <a href="Milonia%20Caesonia">Milonia Caesonia</a> and their daughter <a href="Julia%20Drusilla%20%28daughter%20of%20Caligula%29">Julia Drusilla</a> were murdered on January 24, 41. Agrippina's paternal uncle, <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>, brother of her father <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a>, became the new Roman Emperor.

<a href="Claudius">Claudius</a> lifted the exiles of Agrippina and Livilla. Livilla returned to her husband, while Agrippina was reunited with her estranged son. After the death of her first husband, Agrippina tried to make shameless advances to the future emperor <a href="Galba">Galba</a>, who showed no interest in her and was devoted to his wife <a href="Aemilia%20Lepida">Aemilia Lepida</a>. On one occasion, Galba's mother-in-law gave Agrippina, in a whole bevy of married women, a public reprimand and a slap in the face.

Claudius had Lucius' inheritance reinstated. Lucius became more wealthy despite his youth shortly after <a href="Gaius%20Sallustius%20Crispus%20Passienus">Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus</a> divorced Lucius' aunt, <a href="Domitia%20Lepida%20the%20Elder">Domitia Lepida the Elder</a> (Lucius' first paternal aunt) so that Crispus could marry Agrippina. They married, and Crispus became a step-father to Lucius. Crispus was a prominent, influential, witty, wealthy and powerful man, who served twice as consul. He was the adopted grandson and biological great-great-nephew of the historian <a href="Sallust">Sallust</a>. Little is known on their relationship, but Crispus soon died and left his estate to Nero.

In the first years of Claudius' reign, Claudius was married to the infamous Empress <a href="Valeria%20Messalina">Valeria Messalina</a>. Although Agrippina was very influential, she kept a very low profile and stayed away from the imperial palace and the court of the emperor. Messalina was Agrippina's second paternal cousin. Among the victims of Messalina's intrigues were Agrippina's surviving sister Livilla, who was charged with having adultery with <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca the Younger</a>. Seneca was later called back from exile to be a tutor to Nero.

Messalina considered Agrippina's son a threat to her son's position and sent assassins to strangle Lucius during his siesta. The assassins fled in terror when they saw a snake suddenly dart from beneath Lucius' pillow—but it was only a sloughed-off snake-skin in his bed, near his pillow.

In 47, Crispus died, and at his funeral, the rumor spread around that Agrippina poisoned Crispus to gain his estate. After being widowed a second time, Agrippina was left very wealthy. Later that year at the <a href="Secular%20Games">Secular Games</a>, at the performance of the Troy Pageant, Messalina attended the event with her son Britannicus. Agrippina was also present with Lucius. Agrippina and Lucius received greater applause from the audience than Messalina and <a href="Britannicus">Britannicus</a> did. Many people began to show pity and sympathy to Agrippina, due to the unfortunate circumstances in her life. Agrippina wrote a memoir that recorded the misfortunes of her family (casus suorum) and wrote an account of her mother's life.

After Messalina was executed in 48 for conspiring with <a href="Gaius%20Silius">Gaius Silius</a> to overthrow her husband, Claudius considered remarrying for the fourth time. Around this time, Agrippina became the mistress to one of Claudius' advisers, the former Greek Freedman <a href="Pallas%20%28freedman%29">Marcus Antonius Pallas</a>. At that time Claudius' advisers were discussing which noblewoman Claudius should marry. Claudius had a reputation that he was easily persuaded. In more recent times, it has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage between Agrippina and Claudius to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches. This feud dated back to Agrippina's <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Elder">mother's</a> actions against Tiberius after the death of Germanicus, actions which Tiberius had gladly punished.

Claudius made references to her in his speeches: "my daughter and foster child, born and bred, in my lap, so to speak". When Claudius decided to marry her, he persuaded a group of senators that the marriage should be arranged in the public interest. In Roman society, an uncle (Claudius) marrying his niece (Agrippina) was considered incestuous, and obviously immoral.

Agrippina and Claudius married on New Year's Day, 49. This marriage caused widespread disapproval. This was a part of Agrippina's scheming plan to make Lucius the new emperor. Her marriage to Claudius was not based on love, but on power. She quickly eliminated her rival <a href="Lollia%20Paulina">Lollia Paulina</a>. In 49, shortly after marrying Claudius, Agrippina charged Paulina with <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>. Paulina did not receive a hearing. Her property was confiscated. She left Italy and, on Agrippina's orders, committed suicide.

In the months leading up to her marriage to Claudius, Agrippina's maternal second cousin, the <a href="praetor">praetor</a> <a href="Lucius%20Junius%20Silanus%20Torquatus">Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus</a>, was betrothed to Claudius' daughter <a href="Claudia%20Octavia">Claudia Octavia</a>. This betrothal was broken off in 48 when Agrippina, scheming with the consul <a href="Lucius%20Vitellius%20the%20Elder">Lucius Vitellius the Elder</a>, the father of the future Emperor <a href="Aulus%20Vitellius">Aulus Vitellius</a>, falsely accused Silanus of incest with his sister <a href="Junia%20Calvina">Junia Calvina</a>. Agrippina did this hoping to secure a marriage between Octavia and her son. Consequently, Claudius broke off the engagement and forced Silanus to resign from public office.

Silanus committed suicide on the day that Agrippina married her uncle, and Calvina was exiled from <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in early 49. Calvina was called back from exile after the death of Agrippina. Towards the end of 54, Agrippina would order the murder of Silanus' eldest brother <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Silanus%20Torquatus%20%28consul%20AD%2046%29">Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus</a> without Nero's knowledge, so that he would not seek revenge against her over his brother's death.

On the day that Agrippina married her uncle Claudius as her third husband/his fourth wife, she became an Empress and the most powerful woman in the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. She also was a stepmother to <a href="Claudia%20Antonia">Claudia Antonia</a>, Claudius' daughter and only child from his second marriage to <a href="Aelia%20Paetina">Aelia Paetina</a>, and to the young <a href="Claudia%20Octavia">Claudia Octavia</a> and <a href="Britannicus">Britannicus</a>, Claudius' children with Valeria Messalina. Agrippina removed or eliminated anyone from the palace or the imperial court who she thought was loyal and dedicated to the memory of the late Messalina. She also eliminated or removed anyone who she considered was a potential threat to her position and the future of her son, one of her victims being Lucius' second paternal aunt and Messalina's mother <a href="Domitia%20Lepida%20the%20Younger">Domitia Lepida the Younger</a>.

In 49, Agrippina was seated on a dais at a parade of captives when their leader the <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> King <a href="Caratacus">Caratacus</a> bowed before her with the same homage and gratitude as he accorded the emperor. In 50, Agrippina was granted the honorific title of <a href="Augusta%20%28honorific%29">Augusta</a>. She was only the third Roman woman (<a href="Livia">Livia</a> Drusilla and <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a> received this title) and only the second living Roman woman (the first being Antonia) to receive this title.

Also that year, Claudius had founded a Roman colony and called the colony "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis" or "Agrippinensium", today known as <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a "carpentum" which she used. A carpentum was a sort of ceremonial carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the <a href="Vestal%20Virgin">Vestal Virgin</a>s, and sacred statues. That same year she appointed <a href="Sextus%20Afranius%20Burrus">Sextus Afranius Burrus</a> as the head of the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a>, replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, <a href="Rufrius%20Crispinus">Rufrius Crispinus</a>.

Ancient sources claim that Agrippina successfully manipulated and influenced Claudius into adopting her son and having him become his successor. Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in 50 was adopted by his great maternal uncle and stepfather. Lucius' name was changed to <a href="Nero">Nero</a> Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus and he became Claudius's adopted son, heir and recognised successor. Agrippina and Claudius betrothed Nero to Octavia, and Agrippina arranged to have <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca the Younger</a> return from exile to tutor the future emperor. Claudius chose to adopt Nero because of his Julian and Claudian lineage.

Agrippina deprived Britannicus of his heritage and further isolated him from his father and succession for the throne in every way possible. For instance, in 51, Agrippina ordered the execution of Britannicus' tutor Sosibius because he had confronted her and was outraged by Claudius' adoption of Nero and his choice of Nero as successor, instead of choosing his own son Britannicus.

Nero and Octavia were married on June 9, 53. Claudius later repented of marrying Agrippina and adopting Nero, began to favor Britannicus, and started preparing him for the throne. His actions allegedly gave Agrippina a motive to eliminate Claudius. The ancient sources say she poisoned Claudius on October 13, 54 with a plate of deadly <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s at a banquet, thus enabling <a href="Nero">Nero</a> to quickly take the throne as emperor. Accounts vary wildly with regard to this private incident and according to more modern sources, it is possible (but exceedingly convenient) that Claudius died of natural causes; Claudius was 63 years old.

Agrippina was named a priestess of the cult of the deified Claudius. She was allowed to visit senate meetings, watching and hearing the meetings from behind a curtain. 

In the first months of Nero's reign Agrippina controlled her son and the Empire. She lost control over Nero when he began to have an affair with the freed woman <a href="Claudia%20Acte">Claudia Acte</a>, which Agrippina strongly disapproved of and violently scolded him for. Agrippina began to support <a href="Britannicus">Britannicus</a> in her attempt to make him emperor. Britannicus was secretly poisoned on Nero's orders during his own banquet in February 55. The power struggle between Agrippina and her son had begun. 

Agrippina between 55 and 58 became very watchful and had a critical eye over her son. In 55, Agrippina was forced out of the palace by her son to live in imperial residence. Nero deprived his mother of all honors and powers, and even removed her Roman and German bodyguards. Nero even threatened his mother he would abdicate the throne and would go to live on the Greek Island of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, a place where <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> had lived after divorcing <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia the Elder</a>. Pallas also was dismissed from the court. The fall of Pallas and the opposition of Burrus and Seneca, contributed to Agrippina's loss of authority.

Towards 57, Agrippina was expelled from the palace and went to live in a riverside estate in <a href="Misenum">Misenum</a>. While Agrippina lived there or when she went on short visits to Rome, Nero had sent people to annoy her. Although living in Misenum, she was still very popular, powerful and influential. Agrippina and Nero would see each other on short visits. 

The circumstances that surround Agrippina's death are uncertain due to historical contradictions and anti-Nero bias. All surviving stories of Agrippina's death contradict themselves and each other, and are generally fantastical.

According to <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, in 58, Nero became involved with the noble woman <a href="Poppaea%20Sabina">Poppaea Sabina</a>. With the reasoning that a divorce from Octavia and a marriage to Poppaea was not politically feasible with Agrippina alive, Nero decided to kill Agrippina. Yet, Nero did not marry Poppaea until 62, calling into question this motive. Additionally, <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> reveals that Poppaea's husband, <a href="Otho">Otho</a>, was not sent away by Nero until after Agrippina's death in 59, making it highly unlikely that already married Poppaea would be pressing Nero. Some modern historians theorize that Nero's decision to kill Agrippina was prompted by her plotting to set Gaius <a href="Rubellius%20Plautus">Rubellius Plautus</a> (Nero's maternal second cousin) or <a href="Britannicus">Britannicus</a> (Claudius' biological son) on the throne.

Tacitus claims that Nero considered poisoning or stabbing her, but felt these methods were too difficult and suspicious, so he settled on – after the advice of his former tutor <a href="Anicetus%20%28admiral%29">Anicetus</a> – building a self-sinking boat. Though aware of the plot, Agrippina embarked on this boat and was nearly crushed by a collapsing lead ceiling only to be saved by the side of a sofa breaking the ceiling's fall. Though the collapsing ceiling missed Agrippina, it crushed her attendant who was outside by the helm.

The boat failed to sink from the lead ceiling, so the crew then sank the boat, but Agrippina swam to shore. Her friend, <a href="Acerronia%20Polla">Acerronia Polla</a>, was attacked by oarsmen while still in the water, and was either bludgeoned to death or drowned, since she was exclaiming that she was Agrippina, with the intention of being saved. She did not know, however, that this was an assassination attempt, not a mere accident. Agrippina was met at the shore by crowds of admirers. News of Agrippina's survival reached Nero so he sent three assassins to kill her.

According to <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a>, Nero was annoyed at his mother being too watchful and tried three times to poison Agrippina, but she took the antidotes in time and survived. He then tried to crush her with a mechanical ceiling over her bed at her residence. After this failed, he devised a collapsible boat, which would either have its cabin fall in or become shipwrecked. Nero then ordered captains of a different boat to ram this boat while Agrippina was aboard. Nero heard Agrippina survived the wreck so he ordered her to be executed and framed it as a suicide.

The tale of <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> is also somewhat different. It starts again with Poppaea as the motive behind the murder. Nero designed a ship that would open at the bottom while at sea. Agrippina was put aboard and after the bottom of the ship opened up, she fell into the water. Agrippina swam to shore so Nero sent an assassin to kill her. Nero then claimed Agrippina plotted to kill him and committed suicide. Her reputed last words, uttered as the assassin was about to strike, were "Smite my womb", the implication here being she wished to be destroyed first in that part of her body that had given birth to so "abominable a son."

After Agrippina's death, Nero viewed her corpse and commented how beautiful she was, according to some. Her body was cremated that night on a dining couch. At his mother's funeral, Nero was witless, speechless and rather scared. When the news spread that Agrippina had died, the Roman army, senate and various people sent him letters of congratulations that he had been saved from his mother's plots.

During the remainder of Nero's reign, Agrippina's grave was not covered or enclosed. Her household later on gave her a modest tomb in <a href="Misenum">Misenum</a>. Nero would have his mother's death on his conscience. He felt so guilty he would sometimes have nightmares about his mother. He even saw his mother's ghost and got <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n magicians to scare her away. Years before she died, Agrippina had visited <a href="astrologer">astrologer</a>s to ask about her son's future. The astrologers had rather accurately predicted that her son would become emperor and would kill her. She replied, "Let him kill me, provided he becomes emperor," according to <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>.

American Chinese cuisine

American Chinese cuisine is a style of <a href="Chinese%20cuisine">Chinese cuisine</a> developed by <a href="Americans%20of%20Chinese%20descent">Americans of Chinese descent</a>. The dishes served in many North American <a href="Chinese%20restaurant">Chinese restaurant</a>s are adapted to American tastes and often differ significantly from those found in China. Of the various <a href="Chinese%20cuisine%23Regional%20cuisines">regional cuisines in China</a>, <a href="Cantonese%20cuisine">Cantonese cuisine</a> has been the most influential in the development of American Chinese food, especially that of <a href="Toisan">Toisan</a>, the origin of most early immigrants.

Chinese immigrants arrived in the United States to work as miners and railroad workers. As the large groups of Chinese immigrants arrived, laws were put in place preventing them from owning land. They mostly lived together in ghettos, individually referred to as "<a href="Chinatowns%20in%20the%20United%20States">Chinatown</a>". Here the immigrants started their own small businesses, including restaurants and laundry services. By the 19th century, the Chinese community in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> operated sophisticated and sometimes luxurious restaurants patronised mainly by Chinese. The restaurants in smaller towns (mostly owned by Chinese immigrants) served food based on what their customers requested, anything ranging from pork chop sandwiches and apple pie, to beans and eggs. Many of these small-town restaurant owners were self-taught family cooks who improvised on different cooking methods and ingredients. These smaller restaurants were responsible for developing American Chinese cuisine, where the food was modified to suit a more American palate. First catering to miners and railroad workers, they established new eateries in towns where Chinese food was completely unknown, adapting local ingredients and catering to their customers' tastes. Even though the new flavors and dishes meant they were not strictly Chinese cuisine, these Chinese restaurants have been cultural ambassadors to Americans.

Along the way, cooks adapted southern Chinese dishes such as <a href="chop%20suey">chop suey</a> and developed a style of Chinese food not found in China. Restaurants (along with Chinese laundries) provided an ethnic niche for small businesses at a time when the Chinese people were excluded from most jobs in the wage economy by ethnic discrimination or lack of language fluency. By the 1920s, this cuisine, particularly chop suey, became popular among middle-class Americans. However, after World War II it began to be dismissed for not being "authentic." Late 20th century tastes have been more accommodating. Take away food became popular amongst Americans, Chinese food becoming a favourite "take out" option. By this time it became evident that Chinese restaurants no longer catered mainly for Chinese customers.

With the continuing success of American Chinese cuisine, including its portrayal to mainland Chinese audiences through the medium of American television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>s, American Chinese restaurants have opened in China itself. Products and ingredients needed to recreate these adapted dishes are imported into China. They include "Philadelphia <a href="cream%20cheese">cream cheese</a>, Skippy <a href="peanut%20butter">peanut butter</a>, <a href="Corn%20flakes">cornflakes</a> and English <a href="Mustard%20seed">mustard powder</a>".

In 2011, the <a href="Smithsonian%20National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">Smithsonian National Museum of American History</a> displayed some of the historical background and cultural artefacts of American Chinese cuisine in its exhibit entitled, "Sweet & Sour: A Look at the History of Chinese Food in the United States".

American Chinese food builds from styles and food habits brought from the southern province of <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>, typically the Toisan district of Toisan, the origin of most Chinese immigration before the <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201924">closure of immigration from China</a> in 1924. These Chinese families developed new styles and used readily available ingredients, especially in California. The types of Chinese American cooking served in restaurants was different from the foods eaten in Chinese American homes. 

Among the common differences is to treat <a href="vegetable">vegetable</a>s as a side dish or <a href="garnish%20%28food%29">garnish</a>, while traditional cuisines of China emphasize vegetables. This can be seen in the use of <a href="carrot">carrot</a>s and <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es. Cuisine in China makes frequent use of Asian <a href="leaf%20vegetable">leaf vegetable</a>s like <a href="bok%20choy">bok choy</a> and <a href="kai-lan">kai-lan</a> and puts a greater emphasis on fresh <a href="meat">meat</a> and <a href="seafood">seafood</a>.
<a href="Stir%20frying">Stir frying</a>, <a href="pan%20frying">pan frying</a>, and <a href="deep%20frying">deep frying</a> tend to be the most common <a href="Chinese%20cooking%20techniques">Chinese cooking techniques</a> used in American Chinese cuisine, which are all easily done using a <a href="wok">wok</a> (a Chinese frying pan with bowl-like features). The food also has a reputation for high levels of <a href="Monosodium%20glutamate">MSG</a> to enhance the flavor. Market forces and customer demand have encouraged many restaurants to offer "MSG Free" or "No MSG" menus, or to omit this ingredient on request.
American Chinese cuisine takes advantage of ingredients not native to and very rarely used in China. One such example is the common use of western <a href="broccoli">broccoli</a> () instead of Chinese broccoli (<a href="Gai-lan">Gai-lan</a>, ) in American Chinese cuisine. Occasionally, western broccoli is also referred to as "" in Cantonese () in order not to confuse the two styles of broccoli. Among Chinese speakers, however, it is typically understood that one is referring to the leafy vegetable unless otherwise specified.

This is also the case with the words for <a href="carrot">carrot</a> ("luo buo" or "lo bac," or "hong luo buo", "hong" meaning "red") and <a href="onion">onion</a> ("cong"). "Lo bac", in <a href="Cantonese">Cantonese</a>, refers to a large, pungent white <a href="radish">radish</a>. The orange western carrot is known in some areas of China as "foreign <a href="radish">radish</a>" (or more properly "hung lo bac" in Cantonese, "hung" meaning "red"). When the word for onion, "cong", is used, it is understood that one is referring to "green onions" (otherwise known to English-speakers as "<a href="scallion">scallion</a>s" or "spring onions"). The larger many-layered onion bulb common in the United States is called "yang cong". This translates as "western onion". These names make it evident that the American broccoli, carrot, and onion are not indigenous to China, and therefore are less common in the traditional cuisines of China.

<a href="Yeung%20Chow%20Fried%20Rice">Egg fried rice</a> in American Chinese cuisine is also prepared differently, with more soy sauce added for more flavor whereas the traditional egg fried rice uses less soy sauce. Some food styles such as <a href="Dim%20sum">Dim sum</a> were also modified to fit American palates, such as added batter for fried dishes and extra soy sauce.

<a href="Salad">Salad</a>s containing raw or uncooked ingredients are rare in traditional Chinese cuisine, as are Japanese style <a href="sushi">sushi</a> or <a href="sashimi">sashimi</a>. However, an increasing number of American Chinese restaurants, including some upscale establishments, have started to offer these items in response to customer demand.

<a href="Ming%20Tsai">Ming Tsai</a>, the owner of the Blue Ginger restaurant in <a href="Wellesley%2C%20Massachusetts">Wellesley, Massachusetts</a> and host of <a href="PBS">PBS</a> culinary show "<a href="Simply%20Ming">Simply Ming</a>", said that American Chinese restaurants typically try to have food representing 3-5 regions of China at one time, have <a href="chop%20suey">chop suey</a>, or have "fried vegetables and some protein in a thick sauce", "eight different sweet and sour dishes", or "a whole page of 20 different chow meins or fried rice dishes". Tsai said "Chinese-American cuisine is 'dumbed-down' Chinese food. It’s adapted... to be blander, thicker and sweeter for the American public".

Most American Chinese establishments cater to non-Chinese customers with menus written in English or containing pictures. If separate Chinese-language menus are available, they typically feature items such as <a href="liver%20%28food%29">liver</a>, <a href="chicken%20feet">chicken feet</a>, or other meat dishes that might deter American customers. In <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Manhattan">Chinatown, New York</a>, the restaurants were known for having a "phantom" menu with food preferred by ethnic Chinese, but believed to be disliked by non-Chinese Americans.

Dishes that often appear on American Chinese restaurant menus include:




Since the early 1990s, many American Chinese restaurants influenced by <a href="California%20cuisine">California cuisine</a> have opened in San Francisco and the Bay Area. The trademark dishes of American Chinese cuisine remain on the menu, but there is more emphasis on fresh vegetables, and the selection is vegetarian-friendly.

This new cuisine has exotic ingredients like <a href="mango">mango</a>s and <a href="portobello%20mushroom">portobello mushroom</a>s. <a href="Brown%20rice">Brown rice</a> is often offered as an optional alternative to <a href="white%20rice">white rice</a>. Some restaurants substitute grilled wheat flour <a href="tortilla">tortilla</a>s for the rice pancakes in <a href="mu%20shu">mu shu</a> dishes. This occurs even in some restaurants that would not otherwise be identified as California Chinese, both the more Westernized places and the more authentic places. There is a Mexican bakery that sells some restaurants thinner tortillas made for use with mu shu. Mu shu purists do not always react positively to this trend.

In addition, many restaurants serving more native-style Chinese cuisines exist, due to the high numbers and proportion of ethnic Chinese in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Restaurants specializing in Cantonese, Sichuanese, Hunanese, Northern Chinese, Shanghainese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong traditions are widely available, as are more specialized restaurants such as seafood restaurants, <a href="Hong%20Kong-style%20Western%20cuisine">Hong Kong-style diners and cafes</a>, also known as "<a href="Cha%20chaan%20teng">Cha chaan teng</a>" (), <a href="dim%20sum">dim sum</a> teahouses, and <a href="hot%20pot">hot pot</a> restaurants. Many Chinatown areas also feature <a href="Chinese%20bakery%20products">Chinese bakeries</a>, <a href="boba%20milk%20tea">boba milk tea</a> shops, <a href="siu%20mei">roasted meat</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Buddhist%20cuisine">vegetarian cuisine</a>, and specialized dessert shops. <a href="Chop%20suey">Chop suey</a> is not widely available in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and the city's chow mein is different from Midwestern chow mein.

Authentic restaurants with Chinese-language menus may offer "<a href="yellow-hair%20chicken">yellow-hair chicken</a>" (), essentially a <a href="free%20range">free-range</a> chicken, as opposed to typical American mass-farmed chicken. Yellow-hair chicken is valued for its flavor, but needs to be cooked properly to be tender due to its lower fat and higher muscle content. This dish usually does not appear on the English-language menu.

<a href="Dau%20Miu">Dau Miu</a> () is a Chinese vegetable that has become popular since the early 1990s, and now not only appears on English-language menus, usually as "pea shoots", but is often served by upscale non-Asian restaurants as well. Originally it was only available during a few months of the year, but it is now grown in greenhouses and is available year-round.

Hawaiian-Chinese food developed a bit differently from the continental United States. Owing to the diversity of ethnicities in Hawaii and the history of the <a href="Chinese%20immigration%20to%20Hawaii">Chinese influence in Hawaii</a>, resident Chinese cuisine forms a component of the <a href="cuisine%20of%20Hawaii">cuisine of Hawaii</a>, which is a <a href="fusion%20cuisine">fusion</a> of different culinary traditions. Some Chinese dishes are typically served as part of <a href="plate%20lunch">plate lunch</a>es in Hawaii. The names of foods are different as well, such as "<a href="Manapua">Manapua</a>", from Hawaiian meaning "chewed up pork" for dim sum "bao", though the meat is not necessarily pork.

The perception that <a href="American%20Jews">American Jews</a> eat at Chinese restaurants on <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a> is documented in media as a common stereotype with a basis in fact. The tradition may have arisen from the lack of other open restaurants on Christmas Day, as well as the close proximity of Jewish and Chinese immigrants to each other in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. It has been portrayed in film and television.

Kosher Chinese Food is also available in large cities in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, and are usually under strict Rabbinical Supervision.

Ahmad Shah Durrani

Ahmad Shāh Durrānī (c. 1722 – 16 October 1772) (<a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a>: احمد شاه دراني), also known as Ahmad Khān Abdālī (Pashto, Dari, Arabic, Urdu: احمد خان ابدالي), was the founder of the <a href="Durrani%20Empire">Durrani Empire</a> and is regarded as the founder of the modern <a href="Sovereign%20state">state</a> of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. He began his career by enlisting as a young soldier in the military of the <a href="Afsharid%20dynasty">Afsharid kingdom</a> and quickly rose to become a <a href="commander">commander</a> of the Abdali Regiment, a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> of four thousand <a href="Durrani">Abdali</a> <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pashtun</a> soldiers.

After the assassination of <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah Afshar</a> in 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani was chosen as <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Afghanistan">King of Afghanistan</a>. Rallying his Afghan tribes and allies, he pushed east towards the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> and the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha</a> empires of <a href="India">India</a>, west towards the disintegrating Afsharid Empire of Persia, and north toward the <a href="Khanate%20of%20Bukhara">Khanate of Bukhara</a>. Within a few years, he extended his control from <a href="Khorasan%20Province">Khorasan</a> in the west to <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and <a href="North%20India">North India</a> in the east, and from the <a href="Amu%20Darya">Amu Darya</a> in the north to the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a> in the south.

Durrani's <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> is located at <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, Afghanistan, adjacent to the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20Cloak">Shrine of the Cloak</a> in the center of the city. Afghans often refer to him as "Ahmad Shāh Bābā" ("Ahmad Shah the <a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation%23List">Father</a>").

Durrani was born in or about 1722 to Mohammad Zaman Khan, chief of the <a href="Durrani">Abdali</a> tribe and <a href="list%20of%20governors%20of%20Herat">Governor of Herat</a>, and Zarghuna Alakozai. There has been some debate about Durrani's exact place of birth. Most believe that he was born in <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, Afghanistan. He was born as Ahmed Khan. Abdali's father suffered "Persian captivity for many years" at <a href="Kirman">Kirman</a> before being released from prison in 1715. As a refugee, he "made his way to <a href="India">India</a>" and joined his kinsmen at <a href="Multan">Multan</a>. After he raised his family there, he was recognized as the "scion of hereditary Sadozai chiefs". It is believed that Zaman Khan returned to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to fight the Persians and his Afghan rivals, but left one of his wives at Multan because she was "in the family way". So other sources believe that, Abdali was born at Multan in 1722, after which she returned to Afghanistan to reunite with her husband. He lost his father during his infancy.

Durrani's forefathers were <a href="Sadozai%20%28Pastun%20tribe%29">Sadozais</a> but his mother was from the <a href="Alakozai">Alakozai</a> tribe. In June 1729, the Abdali forces under Zulfiqar had surrendered to Nader Shah Afshar, the rising new ruler of Persia. However, they soon began a rebellion and took over Herat as well as Mashad. In July 1730, he defeated Ibrahim Khan, a military commander and brother of <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a>. This prompted Nader Shah to retake Mashad and also intervene in the power struggle of Harat. By July 1731, Zulfiqar returned to his capital <a href="Farah%2C%20Afghanistan">Farah</a> where he had been serving as the <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20Farah">governor</a> since 1726. A year later Nadir's brother Ibrahim Khan took control of Farah. During this time Zulfiqar and the young Durrani fled to Kandahar where they took refuge with the Ghiljis. They were later made political prisoners by <a href="Hussain%20Hotak">Hussain Hotak</a>, the Ghilji ruler of the Kandahar region.

Nader Shah had been enlisting the Abdalis in his army since around 1729. After <a href="Siege%20of%20Kandahar">conquering Kandahar</a> in 1738, Durrani and his brother Zulfiqar were freed and provided with leading careers in Nader Shah's administration. Zulfiqar was made Governor of <a href="Mazandaran%20Province">Mazandaran</a> while Durrani remained working as Nader Shah's personal attendant. The Ghiljis, who are originally from the territories east of the Kandahar region, were expelled from Kandahar in order to resettle the Abdalis along with some <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a> and other Persians.

Durrani proved himself in Nader Shah's service and was promoted from a personal attendant ("yasāwal") to command the Abdali Regiment, a <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> of four thousand soldiers and officers. The Abdali Regiment was part of Nader Shah's military during his <a href="Nader%20Shah%23Invasion%20of%20the%20Mughal%20Empire">invasion of the Mughal Empire</a> in 1738.

Popular history has it that the Shah could see the talent in his young commander. Later on, according to Pashtun legend, it is said that in Delhi Nader Shah summoned Durrani, and said, "Come forward Ahmad Abdali. Remember Ahmad Khan Abdali, that after me the Kingship will pass on to you. Nader Shah recruited him because of his "impressive personality and valour" also because of his "loyalty to the Persian monarch".

Nader Shah's rule abruptly ended in June 1747 when he was assassinated by his own guards. The guards involved in the assassination did so secretly so as to prevent the Abdalis from coming to their King's rescue. However, Durrani was told that the Shah had been killed by one of his wives. Despite the danger of being attacked, the Abdali contingent led by Durrani rushed either to save the Shah or to confirm what happened. Upon reaching the Shah's tent, they were only to see his body and severed head. Having served him so loyally, the Abdalis wept at having failed their leader, and headed back to Kandahar. Before the retreat to Kandahar, he had "removed" the royal seal from Nader Shah's finger and the <a href="Koh-i-Noor">Koh-i-Noor</a> diamond tied "around the arm of his deceased master". On their way back to Kandahar, the Abdalis had "unanimously accepted" Durrani as their new leader. Hence he "assumed the insignia of royalty" as the "sovereign ruler of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>".
One of Durrani's first acts as chief was to adopt the titles "Padishah-i-Ghazi" ("victorious emperor"), and "Durr-i-Durrani" ("pearl of pearls" or "pearl of the age").

Following his predecessor, Durrani set up a special force closest to him consisting mostly of his fellow Durranis and other Pashtuns, as well as <a href="Tajik%20people">Tajiks</a>, <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a> and other Muslims. He began his military conquest by capturing <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a> from the Ghiljis and then wresting <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> from the local ruler, and thus strengthened his hold over Khorasan. Leadership of the various Afghan tribes rested mainly on the ability to provide booty for the clan, and Durrani proved remarkably successful in providing both booty and occupation for his followers. Apart from invading the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a> three times between the years 1747–1753, he captured Herat in 1750.

Abdali invaded the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> seven times from 1748 to 1767. According to Jaswant Lal Mehta, Durrani aroused the Afghans "religious passions" to fire and "sword into the land of infidels India." He crossed the <a href="Khyber%20pass">Khyber pass</a> in December 1747 with 40,000 troops for his first invasion of India. He occupied <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> without any opposition. He first crossed the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a> in 1748, the year after his ascension – his forces sacked and absorbed <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>. The following year (1749), the Mughal ruler was induced to cede <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> and all of the Punjab including the vital trans Indus River to him, in order to save his capital from being attacked by the forces of the Durrani Empire. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Durrani and his forces turned westward to take possession of Herat, which was ruled by Nader Shah's grandson, <a href="Shahrukh%20Afshar">Shah Rukh</a>. The city fell to the Afghans in 1750, after almost a year of siege and bloody conflict; the Afghan forces then pushed on into present-day Iran, capturing Nishapur and Mashhad in 1751. Durrani then pardoned Shah Rukh and reconstituted Khorasan, but a tributary of the Durrani Empire. This marked the westernmost border of the Afghan Empire as set by the <a href="Pul-i-Abrisham">Pul-i-Abrisham</a>, on the Mashhad-Tehran road.

The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a>, who died in 1707. In 1751–52, the "Ahamdiya" treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mughals, when <a href="Balaji%20Bajirao">Balaji Bajirao</a> was the <a href="Peshwa">Peshwa</a> of the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a>. Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled large parts of India from their capital at <a href="Pune">Pune</a> and Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Durrani sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa <a href="Balaji%20Bajirao">Balaji Bajirao</a> sent <a href="Raghunathrao">Raghunathrao</a>. He succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought northwest of India up to <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> under Maratha rule. Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Durrani chose to return to India and confront the Maratha forces to regain northwestern part of the subcontinent.

In 1761, Durrani set out on his campaign to win back lost territories. The early skirmishes ended in victory for the Afghans against the Maratha garrisons in northwest India. By 1759, Durrani and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of <a href="Sadashivrao%20Bhau">Sadashivrao Bhau</a>. Once again, <a href="Panipat">Panipat</a> was the scene of a battle for control of northern India. The <a href="Third%20battle%20of%20Panipat">Third battle of Panipat</a> was fought between Durrani's Afghan forces and the Maratha forces in January 1761, and resulted in a decisive Durrani victory. This brought Punjab till north of <a href="Sutlej%20river">Sutlej river</a> under Afghan control. Ahmad Shah Durrani vacated Delhi soon after the battle.

The historical area of what is modern day Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> and <a href="Dzungaria">Dzungaria</a>, and was originally populated by Indo-European Tocharian and Eastern Iranian Saka peoples who practiced the <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> religion. The area was subjected to <a href="Islamicisation%20and%20Turkicisation%20of%20Xinjiang">Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims</a>. Both the Buddhist Turkic Uyghurs and Muslim Turkic Karluks participated in the Turkification and conquest of the native Buddhist Indo-European inhabitants of the Tarim Basin. The Turkic Muslims then proceeded to conquer the Turkic Buddhists in Islamic holy wars and converted them to Islam. The mixture between the invading Mongoloid Turkic peoples and the native Caucasian Indo-European inhabitants resulted in the modern day Turkic speaking hybrid Europoid-East Asian inhabitants of Xinjiang. The Turkification was carried out in the 9th and 10th centuries by two different Turkic Kingdoms, the Buddhist Uyghur <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Qocho">Kingdom of Qocho</a> and the Muslim <a href="Karluks">Karluk</a> <a href="Kara-Khanid%20Khanate">Kara-Khanid Khanate</a>. Halfway in the 20th century the Saka Iranic Buddhist <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Khotan">Kingdom of Khotan</a> came under attack by the Turkic Muslim Karakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006.

Professor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically <a href="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a>, giving as an example the images in <a href="Bezeklik%20Thousand%20Buddha%20Caves">Bezeklik</a> at temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's original eastern Iranian inhabitants. The modern Uyghurs are now a mixed hybrid of East Asian and Europoid populations.

The Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the <a href="Tarim%20Basin">Tarim Basin</a> of <a href="Altishahr">Altishahr</a> were originally ruled by the <a href="Chagatai%20Khanate">Chagatai Khanate</a> while the nomadic Buddhist <a href="Dzungar%20people">Dzungar</a> <a href="Oirats">Oirats</a> in <a href="Dzungaria">Dzungaria</a> ruled over the <a href="Dzungar%20Khanate">Dzungar Khanate</a>. The Naqshbandi Sufi <a href="Khoja%20%28Turkestan%29">Khoja</a>s, descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the Afaqi Khoja inviting the 5th Dalai Lama, the leader of the Tibetan Buddhists, to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.

Khoja Afaq asked the 5th Dalai Lama when he fled to Lhasa to help his Afaqi faction take control of the Tarim Basin (Kashgaria). The Dzungar leader Galdan was then asked by the Dalai Lama to restore Khoja Afaq as ruler of Kashgararia. Khoja Afaq collaborated with Galdan's Dzungars when the Dzungars conquered the Tarim Basin from 1678-1680 and set up the Afaqi Khojas as puppet client rulers. The Dalai Lama blessed Galdan's conquest of the Tarim Basin and Turfan Basin.

Since 1680 the Dzungars had ruled as suzerain masters over the Tarim, for 16 more years using the Chagatai as their puppet rulers. The Dzungars used a hostage arrangement to rule over the Tarim Basin, keeping as hostsges in Ili either the sons of the leaders like the Khojas and Khans or the leaders themselves. Although the Uighur's culture and religion was left alone, the Dzungars substantially exploited them economically . The Uighurs were forced with multiple taxes by the Dzungars which were burdensome and set by a determined amount, and which they did not even have the ability to pay. They included water conservancy tax, draught animal tax, fruit tax, poll tax, land tax, tress and grass tax, gold and silver tax, and trade tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted a tax of 67,000 tangas of silver from the Kashgar people in <a href="Galdan%20Tseren">Galdan Tseren</a>'s reign, a five percent tax was imposed on foreign traders and a ten percent tax imposed on Muslim merchants, people had to pay a fruit tax if they owned orchards and merchants had to pay a copper and silver tax. Annually the Dzungars extracted 100,000 silver tangas in tax from Yarkand and slapped livestock, stain, commerce, and a gold tax on them. The Dzungars extracted 700 taels of gold, and also extracted cotton, copper, and cloth, from the six regions of Keriya, Kashgar, Khotan, Kucha, Yarkand, and Aksu as stated by Russian topographer Yakoff Filisoff. The Dzungars extracted over 50% of the wheat harvests of Muslims according to Qi-yi-shi (Chun Yuan), 30-40% of the wheat harvests of Muslims according to the Xiyu tuzhi, which labelled the tax as "plunder" of the Muslims. The Dzungars also extorted extra taxes on cotton, silver, gold, and traded goods from the Muslims besides making them pay the official tax. "Wine, meat, and women" and "a parting gift" were forcibly extracted from the Uighurs daily by the Dzungars who went to physically gather the taxes from the Uighur Muslims, and if they dissatisfied with what they received, they would rape women, and loot and steal property and livestock. Gold necklaces, diamonds, pearls, and precious stones from India were extracted from the Uighurs under Dāniyāl Khoja by <a href="Tsewang%20Rabtan">Tsewang Rabtan</a> when his daughter was getting married.

67,000 patman (each patman is 4 piculs and 5 pecks) of grain 48,000 silver ounces were forced to be paid yearly by Kashgar to the Dzungars and cash was also paid by the rest of the cities to the Dzungars. Trade, milling, and distilling taxes, corvée labor, saffron, cotton, and grain were also extracted by the Dzungars from the Tarim Basin. Every harvest season, women and food had to be provided to Dzungars when they came to extract the taxes from them.

When the Dzungars levied the traditional nomadic Alban poll tax upon the Muslims of Altishahr, the Muslims viewed it as the payment of <a href="jizyah">jizyah</a> (a tax traditionally taken from non-Muslims by Muslim conquerors).

The Qing defeat of the Dzungars went hand in hand with the anti-Dzungar resistance of the ordinary Uighurs, "many of them, unable to bear their misery, which was like living in a sea of fire, fled but were not able to find a place to settle peacefully." The Uighurs carried out "acts of resistance" like hiding the goods which were collected as taxes or violently resisting the Dzungar Oirat tax collectors, but these incidents were infrequent and widespread anti-Dzungar opposition failed to materialize. Many opponents of Dzungar rule like Uighurs and some dissident Dzungars escaped and defected to Qing China during 1737-1754 and provided the Qing with intelligence on the Dzungars and voiced their grievances. 'Abdullāh Tarkhān Beg and his Hami Uighurs defected and submitted to Qing China after the Qing inflicted a <a href="Battle%20of%20Jao%20Modo">devastating defeat at Chao-mo-do</a> on the Dzungar leader Galdan in September 1696. The Uighur leader Emin Khoja (Amīn Khoja) of Turfan revolted against the Dzungars in 1720 while the Dzungars under Tsewang Rabtan were being attacked by the Qing, and then he also defected and submitted to the Qing. The Uighurs in Kashgar under Yūsuf and his older brother Jahān Khoja of Yarkand revolted in 1754 against the Dzungars, but Jahān was taken prisoner by the Dzungars after he was betrayed by the Uch-Turfan Uighur Xi-bo-ke Khoja and Aksu Uighur Ayyūb Khoja. Kashgar and Yarkand were assaulted by 7,000 Khotan Uighurs under Sādiq, the son of Jahān Khoja. The Uighurs supported the 1755 Qing assault against the Dzungars in Ili, which occurred at the same time as the Uighur revolts against the Dzungars. Uighurs like Emin Khoja, 'Abdu'l Mu'min and Yūsuf Beg supported the Qing attack against <a href="Dawachi">Dawachi</a>, the Dzungar Khan. The Uch-Turfan UighurnBeg Khojis (Huojisi) supported the Qing General Ban-di against in tricking Davachi and taking him prisoner. The Qing and Amin Khoja and his sons worked together to defeat the Dzungars under Amursana.

From the 17th century to the middle of the 18th century, between China proper and Transoxania, all the land was under the sway of the Dzungars. In Semirechye the Kyrgyz and Kazakahs were forcibly driven out by the Dzungars and the Kashgar Khanate was conquered. However, the Dzungar Empire was annihilated by Qing China from 1755-1758 in a formidable assault, ending the Central Asian states danger from the Dzungar menace. Uighur Muslims like Emin Khoja from Turfan revolted against their Dzungar Buddhist rulers and pledged alleigance to Qing China to deliver them from Dzungar Buddhist rule. The Qing crushed and annihilated the Dzungars in the <a href="Dzungar%20genocide">Dzungar genocide</a>.

The Dzungar Buddhists brought back the Aqtaghliq Afaqi Khoja Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khan Khoja and installed them as puppet rulers in Kashgar. During the Qing's war against the Dzungars, Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khan Khoja then pledged alleigance to Qing China in exchange for delivering them from Dzungar rule. However, after the Qing defeated the Dzungars, the Afaqi Khoja brothers Burhan-ud-din and Khan Khoja reneged on the deal with the Qing, declared independence and revolted against the Qing. The Qing and loyal Uighurs like Emin Khoja crushed the revolt and drove Burhan-ud-din and Khan Khoja to <a href="Badakhshan">Badakhshan</a>. The Qing armies reached far in Central Asia and came to the outskirts of <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a> while the Kazakh rulers made their submissions as vassals to the Qing. The Afaqi brothers died in Badakhshan and the ruler Sultan Shah delivered their bodies to the Qing. Ahmad Shah Durrani accused Sultan Shah of having caused the Afaqi brothers to die.

Durrani dispatched troops to <a href="Kokand">Kokand</a> after rumours that the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a> planned to launch an expedition to Samarkand, but the alleged expedition never happened and Ahmad Shah subsequently withdrew his forces when his attempt at an anti-Qing alliance among Central Asian states failed. Durrani then sent envoys to <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> to discuss the situation regarding the <a href="Khoja%20%28Turkestan%29">Afaqi Khojas</a>.

During the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Panipat">Third Battle of Panipat</a> between Marathas and Durrani, the Sikhs did not engage along with the Marathas and hence are considered neutral in the war. This was because of the flawed diplomacy on the part of Marathas in not recognizing their strategic potential. The exception was Ala Singh of <a href="Patiala">Patiala</a>, who sided with the Afghans and was actually being granted and coincidentally crowned the first Sikh Maharajah at the Sikh holy temple.

Durrani died on 16 October 1772 in <a href="Kandahar%20Province">Kandahar Province</a>. He was buried in the city of Kandahar adjacent to the <a href="Shrine%20of%20the%20Cloak">Shrine of the Cloak</a>, where a large <a href="tomb%20of%20Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">tomb</a> was built. It has been described in the following way:
In his tomb his epitaph is written:
Durrani's victory over the Marathas influenced the history of the subcontinent and, in particular, <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> policy in the region. His refusal to continue his campaigns deeper into India prevented a clash with the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> and allowed them to continue to acquire power and influence after they took complete control of the former Mughal province of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> in 1793. However, fear of another Afghan invasion was to haunt British policy for almost half a century after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Panipat%20%281761%29">battle of Panipat</a>. The acknowledgment of Abdali's military accomplishments is reflected in a British intelligence report on the Battle of Panipat, which referred to Ahmad Shah as the 'King of Kings'. This fear led in 1798 to a British envoy being sent to the Persian court in part to instigate the Persians in their claims on Herat to forestall an Afghan invasion of India that might have halted British East India company's expansion. <a href="Mountstuart%20Elphinstone">Mountstuart Elphinstone</a> wrote of Ahmad Shah:
His successors, beginning with his son <a href="Timur%20Shah%20Durrani">Timur</a> and ending with <a href="Shuja%20Shah%20Durrani">Shuja Shah Durrani</a>, proved largely incapable of governing the last Afghan empire and faced with advancing enemies on all sides. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others by the end of the 19th century. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated some <a href="Pashtun%20tribes">Pashtun tribes</a> and those of other Durrani lineages. Until <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan">Dost Mohammad Khan</a>'s ascendancy in 1826, chaos reigned in Afghanistan, which effectively ceased to exist as a single entity, disintegrating into a fragmented collection of small countries or units. This policy ensured that he did not continue on the path of other conquerors like <a href="Babur">Babur</a> or <a href="Muhammad%20of%20Ghor">Muhammad of Ghor</a> and make India the base for his empire.

In Pakistan, a <a href="short-range%20ballistic%20missile">short-range ballistic missile</a> <a href="Abdali-I">Abdali-I</a>, is named in the honour of Ahmed Shah Abdali.

Durrani wrote a collection of <a href="ode">ode</a>s in his native <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto language</a>. He was also the author of several poems in <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>. The most famous Pashto poem he wrote was "Love of a Nation":

Pakhtunkhwa means "Site of Pakhtuns" here: Land of Pakhtuns. In the time of Ahmad Shah Abdali (Durrani) Afghan land does not exist. From 1747 to 1845 existed a dynasty of the Durrani and a Land of Great Khorasan and dependent areas above the Oxus. Durrani was born in Herat. His relatives from the father's side came from <a href="Multan">Multan</a>. Afghan land (Persian Afghanistan) was not developed until the middle of the 19th century. In a map of 1845, for the first time, the present territory of Pashtunkwa was written as Afghanistan. <a href="Afghan">Afghan</a> and <a href="Pathan">Pathan</a> are the Perso-Arabic and Indian nicknames of Pashtun or Pakhtun. A map of Afghanistan is only after the Iranian-British 15-Point- Treaty of 1857 in Paris conceived c. 1868. The country inside was called Mamalik i Iran (countries of Iran), which was still called Persia in other European countries.

During <a href="Nader%20Shah%27s%20invasion%20of%20India">Nader Shah's invasion of India</a> in 1739, Abdali also accompanied him and stayed some days in the <a href="Red%20Fort%2C%20Delhi">Red Fort</a> of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>. When he was standing "outside the Jali gate near Diwan-i-Am", <a href="Asaf%20Jah%20I">Asaf Jah I</a> saw him. He was "an expert in <a href="physiognomy">physiognomy</a>" and predicted that Abdali was "destined to become a king". When <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> came to know about it, he "purportedly clipped" his ears with his dagger and made the remark "When you become a king, this will remind you of me". According to other sources, Nader Shah did not believe in it and asked him to be kind to his descendants "on the attaintment of royalty".

He first became its Treasurer in 1841, and later became the Society's second President.

He was born at <a href="Warrington%2C%20England">Warrington</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> into a distinguished literary family of prominent <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a>. The best known of these was his paternal aunt, <a href="Anna%20Letitia%20Barbauld">Anna Letitia Barbauld</a>, a <a href="man%20of%20letters">woman of letters</a> who wrote poetry and essays as well as early <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a>. His father, <a href="John%20Aikin">Dr John Aikin</a>, was a medical doctor, historian, and author. His grandfather, also called <a href="John%20Aikin%20%28Unitarian%29">John</a> (1713–1780), was a Unitarian scholar and theological tutor, closely associated with <a href="Warrington%20Academy">Warrington Academy</a>. His sister <a href="Lucy%20Aikin">Lucy</a> (1781–1864) was a historical writer. Their brother <a href="Charles%20Rochemont%20Aikin">Charles</a> was adopted by their famous aunt and brought up as their cousin.

Arthur Aikin studied chemistry under <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> in the <a href="New%20College%20at%20Hackney">New College at Hackney</a>, and gave attention to the practical applications of the science. In early life he was a <a href="General%20Assembly%20of%20Unitarian%20and%20Free%20Christian%20Churches">Unitarian minister</a> for a short time. Aikin lectured on chemistry at <a href="Guy%27s%20Hospital">Guy's Hospital</a> for thirty-two years.

Ailanthus

Ailanthus (; derived from "ailanto," an <a href="Ambonese">Ambonese</a> word probably meaning "tree of the gods" or "tree of heaven") is a genus of <a href="tree">tree</a>s belonging to the family <a href="Simaroubaceae">Simaroubaceae</a>, in the order <a href="Sapindales">Sapindales</a> (formerly <a href="Rutales">Rutales</a> or <a href="Geraniales">Geraniales</a>). The genus is native from east <a href="Asia">Asia</a> south to northern <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>.

The number of living species is disputed, with some authorities accepting up to ten species, while others accept six or fewer. Species include:

There is a good fossil record of "Ailanthus" with many species names based on their geographic occurrence, but almost all of these have very similar morphology and have been grouped as a single species among the three species recognized:

A silk spinning moth, the Ailanthus silkmoth ("<a href="Samia%20cynthia">Samia cynthia</a>"), lives on "Ailanthus" leaves, and yields a silk more durable and cheaper than mulberry silk, but inferior to it in fineness and gloss. This moth has been introduced to the eastern United States and is common near many towns; it is about 12 cm across, with angulated wings, and in colour olive brown, with white markings. Other <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> whose <a href="larva">larva</a>e feed on "Ailanthus" include "<a href="Endoclita">Endoclita malabaricus</a>".

In line 12 of his poem 'Dry Salvages' T.S.Eliot refers to 'in the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard' alluding to Walt Whitman's poem
'When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd' which itself refers to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

Aimoin

Aimoin of Fleury (; ), <a href="France">French</a> chronicler, was born at <a href="Villefranche-de-Longchat">Villefranche-de-Longchat</a> about 960, and in early life entered the <a href="monastery">monastery</a> of <a href="Fleury%20Abbey">Fleury</a>, where he became a monk and passed the greater part of his life. His chief work is a "Historia Francorum", or "Libri V. de Gestis Francorum", which deals with the history of the <a href="Franks">Franks</a> from the earliest times to 653, and was continued by other writers until the middle of the twelfth century. It was much in vogue during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, but its historical value is now regarded as slight. It was edited by <a href="Georg%20Waitz">G.

<doc id="1566" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1566" title="Akkadian Empire">
Akkadian Empire

The Akkadian Empire was the first ancient <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic-speaking</a> empire of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, centered in the city of <a href="Akkad%20%28city%29">Akkad</a> and its surrounding region, also called <a href="Akkad%20%28region%29">Akkad</a> in ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> in the Bible. The empire united Akkadian and <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a> speakers under one rule. The Akkadian Empire exercised influence across Mesopotamia, the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, sending military expeditions as far south as <a href="Dilmun">Dilmun</a> and <a href="Magan%20%28civilization%29">Magan</a> (modern <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a> and <a href="Oman">Oman</a>) in the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>.

During the <a href="3rd%20millennium%20BC">3rd millennium BC</a>, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ians and the <a href="Akkadians">Akkadians</a>, which included widespread <a href="bilingualism">bilingualism</a>. <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere between the 3rd and the 2nd millennia BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate).

The Akkadian Empire reached its political peak between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests by its founder <a href="Sargon%20of%20Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a>. Under Sargon and his successors, the Akkadian language was briefly imposed on neighboring conquered states such as <a href="Elam">Elam</a> and <a href="Gutian%20people">Gutium</a>. Akkad is sometimes regarded as the first empire in history, though the meaning of this term is not precise, and there are earlier Sumerian claimants.

After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the people of Mesopotamia eventually coalesced into two major Akkadian-speaking nations: <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> in the north, and, a few centuries later, <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> in the south.

The Bible refers to Akkad in , which states that the beginning of <a href="Nimrod">Nimrod</a>'s kingdom was in the land of Akkad. Nimrod's historical identity is unknown, but some have compared him with the legendary Gilgamesh, founder of <a href="Uruk">Uruk</a>. Today, scholars have documented some 7,000 texts from the Akkadian period, written in both <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a> and <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a>. Many later texts from the successor states of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> and <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> also deal with the Akkadian Empire.

Understanding of the Akkadian Empire continues to be hampered by the fact that its capital <a href="Akkad%20%28city%29">Akkad</a> has not yet been located, despite numerous attempts. Precise dating of <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a>s is hindered by the fact that there are no clear distinctions between <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifact assemblages</a> thought to stem from the preceding <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Mesopotamia%29">Early Dynastic period</a>, and those thought to be Akkadian. Likewise, material that is thought to be Akkadian continues to be in use into the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Ur">Ur III period</a>.

Many of the more recent insights on the Akkadian Empire have come from excavations in the <a href="Khabur%20%28Tigris%29">Upper Khabur</a> area in modern northeastern <a href="Syria">Syria</a> which was to become a part of Assyria after the fall of Akkad. For example, excavations at <a href="Urkesh">Tell Mozan</a> (ancient Urkesh) brought to light a sealing of Tar'am-Agade, a previously unknown daughter of <a href="Naram-Sin%20of%20Akkad">Naram-Sin</a>, who was possibly married to an unidentified local "endan" (ruler). The excavators at nearby <a href="Tell%20Leilan">Tell Leilan</a> (ancient Shekhna/Shubat-Enlil) have used the results from their investigations to argue that the Akkadian Empire came to an end due to a sudden drought, the so-called <a href="4.2%20kiloyear%20event">4.2 kiloyear event</a>. The impact of this climate event on Mesopotamia in general, and on the Akkadian Empire in particular, continues to be hotly debated.

Excavation at the modern site of <a href="Tell%20Brak">Tell Brak</a> has suggested that the Akkadians rebuilt a city ("Brak" or "Nagar") on this site, for use an administrative center. The city included two large buildings including a complex with temple, offices, courtyard, and large ovens.

The Akkadian Period is generally dated to either: (according to the <a href="middle%20chronology">middle</a> <a href="Chronology%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Near%20East">chronology timeline of the Ancient Near East</a>), or (according to the <a href="short%20chronology%20timeline">short chronology timeline</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near East</a>.) It was preceded by the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Mesopotamia">Early Dynastic Period of Mesopotamia</a> (ED) and succeeded by the <a href="Ur%20III%20period">Ur III Period</a>, although both transitions are blurry. For example: it is likely that the rise of <a href="Sargon%20of%20Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a> coincided with the late ED Period and that the final Akkadian kings ruled simultaneously with the <a href="Gutian%20dynasty%20of%20Sumer">Gutian</a> kings alongside rulers at the city-states of both: <a href="Uruk">Uruk</a> and <a href="Lagash">Lagash</a>. The Akkadian Period is contemporary with: EB IV (in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>), EB IVA and EJ IV (in Syria), and EB IIIB (in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>.)

The relative order of Akkadian kings is clear. The absolute dates of their reigns are approximate (as with all dates prior to the <a href="late%20Bronze%20Age%20collapse">late Bronze Age collapse</a> "c." 1200 BC).

The Akkadian Empire takes its name from the <a href="Akkad%20%28region%29">region</a> and city of Akkad, both of which were localized in the general confluence area of the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> Rivers. Although the city of Akkad has not yet been identified on the ground, it is known from various textual sources. Among these is at least one text predating the reign of Sargon. Together with the fact that the name Akkad is of non-<a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> origin, this suggests that the city of Akkad may have already been occupied in pre-Sargonic times.

Sargon of Akkad ("Sharru-kin" = "legitimate king", possibly a title he took on gaining power) defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Uruk">Battle of Uruk</a> and conquered his empire. The earliest records in the Akkadian language date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a <a href="hierodule">hierodule</a>, or priestess to <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> or <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a>. One legend related of Sargon in Assyrian times says that
Later claims made on behalf of Sargon were that his mother was an "entu" priestess (high priestess). The claims might have been made to ensure a descendancy of nobility, considering only a high placed family can be made such a position.
Originally a <a href="cupbearer">cupbearer</a> (<a href="Rabshakeh">Rabshakeh</a>) to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, <a href="Ur-Zababa">Ur-Zababa</a>, Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, Sargon was crowned king, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest. Four times he invaded <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of "the west" to unite them with Mesopotamia "into a single empire".

However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached westward as far as the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and perhaps <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> ("Kaptara"); northward as far as the mountains (a later <a href="Hittite%20language">Hittite</a> text asserts he fought the <a href="Hattians">Hattian</a> king <a href="Nurdaggal">Nurdaggal</a> of <a href="Burushanda">Burushanda</a>, well into <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>); eastward over <a href="Elam">Elam</a>; and as far south as <a href="Magan%20%28civilization%29">Magan</a> (<a href="Oman">Oman</a>) — a region over which he reigned for purportedly 56 years, though only four "year-names" survive. He consolidated his dominion over his territories by replacing the earlier opposing rulers with noble citizens of Akkad, his native city where loyalty would thus be ensured.

Trade extended from the <a href="silver">silver</a> mines of Anatolia to the <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> mines in modern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the <a href="Cedrus%20libani">cedars</a> of <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and the <a href="copper">copper</a> of <a href="Magan%20%28civilization%29">Magan</a>. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia (<a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>/<a href="Subartu">Subartu</a>) were also subjugated, and rebellions in <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and against <a href="Sarlak">Sarlak</a>, king of <a href="Gutian%20period">Gutium</a>. He also boasted of having subjugated the "four quarters" — the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Assyria), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam), and the west (<a href="Amorites">Martu</a>). Some of the earliest historiographic texts (<a href="Babylonian%20Chronicles">ABC 19, 20</a>) suggest he rebuilt the city of Babylon ("Bab-ilu") in its new location near Akkad.

Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a> (<a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>), his patroness, and <a href="Zababa">Zababa</a>, the warrior god of Kish. He called himself "The anointed priest of <a href="Anu">Anu</a>" and "the great" ensi" of <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>" and his daughter, <a href="Enheduanna">Enheduanna</a>, was installed as priestess to <a href="Nanna%20%28Sumerian%20deity%29">Nanna</a> at the temple in <a href="Ur">Ur</a>.

Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states:
It refers to his campaign in "Elam", where he defeated a coalition army led by the King of Awan and forced the vanquished to become his vassals.

Also shortly after, another revolt took place:

Sargon had crushed opposition even at old age. These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons, where revolts broke out during the nine-year reign of <a href="Rimush%20%28Akkad%29">Rimush</a> (2278–2270 BC), who fought hard to retain the empire, and was successful until he was assassinated by some of his own courtiers. Rimush's elder brother, <a href="Manishtushu">Manishtushu</a> (2269–2255 BC) succeeded him. The latter seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him and took control over their pre-<a href="Arabs">Arab</a> country, consisting of modern-day <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> and <a href="Oman">Oman</a>. Despite the success, like his brother he seems to have been assassinated in a palace conspiracy.

Manishtushu's son and successor, <a href="Naram-Sin%20of%20Akkad">Naram-Sin</a> (2254–2218 BC), due to vast military conquests, assumed the imperial title "King Naram-Sin, king of the four quarters" ("Lugal Naram-Sîn, Šar kibrat 'arbaim"), the four quarters as a reference to the entire world. He was also for the first time in Sumerian culture, addressed as "the god (Sumerian = DINGIR, Akkadian = "ilu") of Agade" (Akkad), in opposition to the previous religious belief that kings were only representatives of the people towards the gods.
He also faced revolts at the start of his reign, but quickly crushed them.

Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of <a href="Ebla">Ebla</a> as well as <a href="Armani%20%28kingdom%29">Armanum</a> and its king. Armanum location is debated; it is sometimes identified with a Syrian kingdom mentioned in the tablets of Ebla as <a href="Armi%20%28Syria%29">Armi</a>, the location of Armi is also debated; while historian Adelheid Otto identifies it with the Citadel of Bazi – Tall Banat complex on the Euphrates River between Ebla and <a href="Tell%20Brak">Tell Brak</a>, others like <a href="Wayne%20Horowitz">Wayne Horowitz</a> identify it with <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. Further, if most scholars place Armanum in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, Michael C. Astour believes it to be located north of the <a href="Hamrin%20Mountains">Hamrin Mountains</a> in northern Iraq.

To better police Syria, he built a royal residence at Tell Brak, a crossroads at the heart of the <a href="Khabur%20%28Euphrates%29">Khabur River</a> basin of the <a href="Al-Jazira%2C%20Mesopotamia">Jezirah</a>. Naram-Sin campaigned against Magan which also revolted; Naram-Sin "marched against <a href="Majan%20%28civilization%29">Magan</a> and personally caught Mandannu, its king", where he instated garrisons to protect the main roads. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northern Zagros Mountains, the Lulubis and the Gutians. A campaign against the <a href="Lullubi">Lullubi</a> led to the carving of the "Victory Stele of Naram-Suen", now in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Louvre</a>. <a href="Hittites">Hittite</a> sources claim Naram-Sin of Akkad even ventured into <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, battling the Hittite and <a href="Hurrian">Hurrian</a> kings <a href="Pamba%20%28king%29">Pamba</a> of <a href="Hattians">Hatti</a>, Zipani of <a href="Kanesh">Kanesh</a>, and 15 others.
This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.

The economy was highly planned. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.

In later Assyrian and Babylonian texts, the name "Akkad", together with "Sumer", appears as part of the royal title, as in the Sumerian <a href="LUGAL">LUGAL</a> KI-EN-GI KI-URI or Akkadian "Šar māt Šumeri u Akkadi", translating to "king of Sumer and Akkad". This title was assumed by the king who seized control of <a href="Nippur">Nippur</a>, the intellectual and religious center of southern Mesopotamia.

During the Akkadian period, the Akkadian language became the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the Sumerian language remained as a spoken and literary language. The spread of Akkadian stretched from Syria to Elam, and even the <a href="Elamite%20language">Elamite language</a> was temporarily written in Mesopotamian <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a>. Akkadian texts later found their way to far-off places, from <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> (in the <a href="Amarna%20Period">Amarna Period</a>) and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, to <a href="Persia">Persia</a> (<a href="Behistun">Behistun</a>).

The empire of Akkad fell, perhaps in the <a href="22nd%20century%20BC">22nd century BC</a>, within 180 years of its founding, ushering in a "<a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Age</a>" with no prominent imperial authority until <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Ur">Third Dynasty of Ur</a>. The region's political structure may have reverted to the "status quo ante" of local governance by <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s.

<a href="Shu-Durul">Shu-Durul</a> appears to have restored some centralized authority, however he was unable to prevent the empire eventually collapsing outright from the invasion of barbarian peoples from the <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> known as the <a href="Gutian%20period">Gutians</a>.

Little is known about the Gutian period, or how long it endured. Cuneiform sources suggest that the Gutians' administration showed little concern for maintaining agriculture, written records, or public safety; they reputedly released all farm animals to roam about Mesopotamia freely, and soon brought about <a href="famine">famine</a> and rocketing grain prices. The Sumerian king <a href="Ur-Nammu">Ur-Nammu</a> (2112–2095 BC) cleared the Gutians from Mesopotamia during his reign.

The Sumerian King List, describing the Akkadian Empire after the death of Shar-kali-shari, states:
However, there are no known year-names or other archaeological evidence verifying any of these later kings of Akkad or Uruk, apart from a single artifact referencing king <a href="Dudu%20of%20Akkad">Dudu of Akkad</a>. The named kings of Uruk may have been contemporaries of the last kings of Akkad, but in any event could not have been very prominent.

The period between BC and 2004 BC is known as the Ur III period. Documents again began to be written in <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a>, although Sumerian was becoming a purely literary or liturgical language, much as Latin later would be in <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

One explanation for the end of the Akkadian empire is simply that the Akkadian dynasty could not maintain its political supremacy over other independently powerful city states.

One theory associates regional decline at the end of the Akkadian period (and of the <a href="First%20Intermediary%20Period">First Intermediary Period</a> following the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East, caused by a global centennial-scale <a href="drought">drought</a>. <a href="Harvey%20Weiss">Harvey Weiss</a> et al. have shown "Archaeological and soil-stratigraphic data define the origin, growth, and collapse of Subir, the third millennium rain-fed agriculture civilization of northern Mesopotamia on the Habur Plains of Syria. At 2200 BC, a marked increase in aridity and wind circulation, subsequent to a volcanic eruption, induced a considerable degradation of land-use conditions. After four centuries of urban life, this abrupt climatic change evidently caused abandonment of Tell Leilan, regional desertion, and collapse of the Akkadian empire based in southern Mesopotamia. Synchronous collapse in adjacent regions suggests that the impact of the abrupt climatic change was extensive.". Peter B. deMenocal, has shown "there was an influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation on the stream flow of the Tigris and Euphrates at this time, which led to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire".

Excavation at <a href="Tell%20Leilan">Tell Leilan</a> suggests that this site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. <a href="Nomad">Nomad</a>ic herders such as the <a href="Amorite">Amorite</a>s moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with Akkadian populations. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom.

This collapse of rain-fed agriculture in the Upper Country meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a wall known as the "Repeller of the Amorites" between the Tigris and Euphrates under the Ur III ruler <a href="Shu-Suen">Shu-Sin</a>. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depression occurred to re-establish <a href="Demography">demographic equilibrium</a> with the less favourable climatic conditions.

Richard Zettler has critiqued the drought theory, observing that the chronology of the Akkadian empire is very uncertain, and that available evidence is not sufficient to show its economic dependence on the northern areas excavated by Weiss and others. He also criticizes Weiss for taking Akkadian writings literally to describe certain catastrophic events.

According to <a href="Joan%20Oates">Joan Oates</a>, at Tell Brak the soil "signal" associated with the drought lies below the level of Naram-Sin's palace. However, evidence

may suggest a tightening of Akkadian control following the Brak 'event', for example the construction of the heavily fortified 'palace' itself and the apparent introduction of greater numbers of Akkadian as opposed to local officials, perhaps a reflection of unrest in the countryside of the type that often follows some natural catastrophe. Furthermore, Brak remained occupied and functional after the fall of the Akkadians.

The Akkadian government formed a "classical standard" with which all future Mesopotamian states compared themselves. Traditionally, the "ensi" was the highest functionary of the Sumerian <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s. In later traditions, one became an "ensi" by marrying the goddess Inanna, legitimising the rulership through divine consent.

Initially, the monarchical "lugal" ("lu" = man, "gal" =Great) was subordinate to the priestly "ensi", and was appointed at times of troubles, but by later dynastic times, it was the "lugal" who had emerged as the preeminent role, having his own ""é"" (= house) or "palace", independent from the temple establishment. By the time of <a href="Mesalim">Mesalim</a>, whichever dynasty controlled the city of Kish was recognised as "šar kiššati" (= king of Kish), and was considered preeminent in Sumer, possibly because this was where the two rivers approached, and whoever controlled Kish ultimately controlled the irrigation systems of the other cities downstream.

As Sargon extended his conquest from the "Lower Sea" (Persian Gulf), to the "Upper Sea" (Mediterranean), it was felt that he ruled "the totality of the lands under heaven", or "from sunrise to sunset", as contemporary texts put it. Under Sargon, the "ensi"s generally retained their positions, but were seen more as provincial governors. The title "šar kiššati" became recognised as meaning "lord of the universe". Sargon is even recorded as having organised naval expeditions to <a href="Dilmun">Dilmun</a> (<a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>) and Magan, amongst the first organised military naval expeditions in history. Whether he also did in the case of the Mediterranean with the kingdom of <a href="Keftiu">Kaptara</a> (possibly <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>), as claimed in later documents, is more questionable.

With Naram-Sin, Sargon's grandson, this went further than with Sargon, with the king not only being called "Lord of the Four Quarters (of the Earth)", but also elevated to the ranks of the "dingir" (= gods), with his own temple establishment. Previously a ruler could, like <a href="Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a>, become divine after death but the Akkadian kings, from Naram-Sin onward, were considered gods on earth in their lifetimes. Their portraits showed them of larger size than mere mortals and at some distance from their retainers.

One strategy adopted by both Sargon and Naram-Sin, to maintain control of the country, was to install their daughters, Enheduanna and Emmenanna respectively, as high priestess to Sin, the Akkadian version of the Sumerian moon deity, Nanna, at Ur, in the extreme south of Sumer; to install sons as provincial "ensi" governors in strategic locations; and to marry their daughters to rulers of peripheral parts of the Empire (<a href="Urkesh">Urkesh</a> and Marhashe). A well documented case of the latter is that of Naram-Sin's daughter Tar'am-Agade at Urkesh.

Records at the Brak administrative complex suggest that the Akkadians appointed locals as <a href="tax%20collector">tax collector</a>s.

The population of Akkad, like nearly all pre-modern states, was entirely dependent upon the agricultural systems of the region, which seem to have had two principal centres: the irrigated farmlands of southern Iraq that traditionally had a yield of 30 grains returned for each grain sown and the rain-fed agriculture of northern Iraq, known as the "Upper Country."

Southern Iraq during Akkadian period seems to have been approaching its modern rainfall level of less than per year, with the result that agriculture was totally dependent upon irrigation. Before the Akkadian period the progressive <a href="soil_salinity">salinisation</a> of the soils, produced by poorly drained irrigation, had been reducing yields of <a href="wheat">wheat</a> in the southern part of the country, leading to the conversion to more salt-tolerant <a href="barley">barley</a> growing. Urban populations there had peaked already by 2,600 BC, and <a href="demography">demographic pressures</a> were high, contributing to the rise of militarism apparent immediately before the Akkadian period (as seen in the <a href="Stele%20of%20the%20Vultures">Stele of the Vultures</a> of <a href="Eannatum">Eannatum</a>). Warfare between city states had led to a population decline, from which Akkad provided a temporary respite. It was this high degree of agricultural productivity in the south that enabled the growth of the highest population densities in the world at this time, giving Akkad its military advantage.

The <a href="water%20table">water table</a> in this region was very high and replenished regularly—by winter storms in the headwaters of the Tigris and Euphrates from October to March and from snow-melt from March to July. Flood levels, that had been stable from about 3,000 to 2,600 BC, had started falling, and by the Akkadian period were a half-meter to a meter lower than recorded previously. Even so, the flat country and weather uncertainties made flooding much more unpredictable than in the case of the Nile; serious deluges seem to have been a regular occurrence, requiring constant maintenance of irrigation ditches and drainage systems. Farmers were recruited into regiments for this work from August to October—a period of food shortage—under the control of city temple authorities, thus acting as a form of unemployment relief. Gwendolyn Leick has suggested that this was Sargon's original employment for the king of Kish, giving him experience in effectively organising large groups of men; a tablet reads, "Sargon, the king, to whom Enlil permitted no rival—5,400 warriors ate bread daily before him".
Harvest was in the late spring and during the dry summer months. <a href="Nomad">Nomad</a>ic <a href="Amorites">Amorites</a> from the northwest would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, they would have to pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.

As a result, Sumer and Akkad had a surplus of agricultural products but was short of almost everything else, particularly metal ores, timber and building stone, all of which had to be imported. The spread of the Akkadian state as far as the "silver mountain" (possibly the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>), the "cedars" of Lebanon, and the copper deposits of Magan, was largely motivated by the goal of securing control over these imports. One tablet reads "Sargon, the king of Kish, triumphed in thirty-four battles (over the cities) up to the edge of the sea (and) destroyed their walls. He made the ships from Meluhha, the ships from Magan (and) the ships from Dilmun tie up alongside the quay of Agade. Sargon the king prostrated himself before (the god) Dagan (and) made supplication to him; (and) he (Dagan) gave him the upper land, namely Mari, Yarmuti, (and) Ebla, up to the Cedar Forest (and) up to the Silver Mountain".

In art there was a great emphasis on the kings of the dynasty, alongside much that continued earlier Sumerian art. Little architecture remains. In large works and small ones such as seals, the degree of realism was considerably increased, but the seals show a "grim world of cruel conflict, of danger and uncertainty, a world in which man is subjected without appeal to the incomprehensible acts of distant and fearful divinities who he must serve but cannot love. This sombre mood ... remained characteristic of Mesopotamian art..."

During the 3rd millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread <a href="wikt%3Abilingualism">bilingualism</a>. The influence of Sumerian on <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a "<a href="sprachbund">sprachbund</a>". Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around 2000 BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

Sumerian literature continued in rich development during the Akkadian period. <a href="Enheduanna">Enheduanna</a>, the "wife (Sumerian "dam" = high priestess) of <a href="Sin%20%28mythology%29">Nanna</a> [the Sumerian moon god] and daughter of Sargon" of the temple of Sin at Ur, who lived –2250 BC, is the first poet in history whose name is known. Her known works include hymns to the goddess <a href="Inanna">Inanna</a>, the "Exaltation of Inanna" and "In-nin sa-gur-ra". A third work, the "Temple Hymns", a collection of specific hymns, addresses the sacred temples and their occupants, the deity to whom they were consecrated. The works of this poet are significant, because although they start out using the third person, they shift to the first person voice of the poet herself, and they mark a significant development in the use of cuneiform. As poet, princess, and priestess, she was a personality who, according to William W Hallo, "set standards in all three of her roles for many succeeding centuries"

In the "Exultation of Inanna",
Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Nara-Sin's attack upon the city of Nipper. When prompted by a pair of inauspicious <a href="oracle">oracle</a>s, the king sacked the <a href="E%20%28temple%29">E</a>-kur temple, supposedly protected by the god <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>, head of the <a href="Pantheon%20%28gods%29">pantheon</a>. As a result of this, eight chief deities of the <a href="Anunnaki">Anunnaki</a> pantheon were supposed to have come together and withdrawn their support from Akkad.
The kings of Akkad were legendary among later Mesopotamian civilizations, with Sargon understood as the prototype of a strong and wise leader, and his grandson Naram-Sin considered the wicked and impious leader ("Unheilsherrscher" in the analysis of <a href="Hans%20Gustav%20G%C3%BCterbock">Hans Gustav Güterbock</a>) who brought ruin upon his kingdom.

 Tablets from the periods reads, ""(From the earliest days) no-one had made a statue of lead, (but) Rimush king of Kish, had a statue of himself made of lead. It stood before Enlil; and it recited his (Rimush's) virtues to the idu of the gods"". The copper <a href="Bassetki%20Statue">Bassetki Statue</a>, cast with the <a href="lost%20wax">lost wax</a> method, testifies to the high level of skill that craftsmen achieved during the Akkadian period.

The empire was bound together by roads, along which there was a regular <a href="mail">postal service</a>. Clay seals that took the place of stamps bear the names of Sargon and his son. A <a href="cadastral">cadastral</a> survey seems also to have been instituted, and one of the documents relating to it states that a certain Uru-Malik, whose name appears to indicate his Canaanite origin, was governor of the land of the Amorites, or "Amurru" as the semi-nomadic people of Syria and Canaan were called in Akkadian. It is probable that the first collection of <a href="astronomy">astronomical</a> observations and terrestrial omens was made for a library established by Sargon. The earliest "year names", whereby each year of a king's reign was named after a significant event performed by that king, date from Sargon's reign. Lists of these "year names" henceforth became a calendrical system used in most independent Mesopotamian city-states. In Assyria, however, years came to be named for the annual presiding "<a href="limmu">limmu</a>" official appointed by the king, rather than for an event.

Ajax the Lesser

Ajax ( "Aias") was a <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythological</a> hero, son of <a href="Oileus">Oileus</a>, the king of <a href="Locris">Locris</a>. He was called the "lesser" or "Locrian" Ajax, to distinguish him from <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax the Great</a>, son of <a href="Telamon">Telamon</a>. He was the leader of the <a href="Locrians">Locrian</a> contingent during the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. 
He is a significant figure in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and is also mentioned in the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" and in <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' "<a href="The%20Trojan%20Women">The Trojan Women</a>". In <a href="Etruscan%20mythology">Etruscan legend</a>, he was known as "Aivas Vilates".

Ajax's mother's name was <a href="Eriopis">Eriopis</a>. According to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, he was born in Naryx in <a href="Locris">Locris</a>, where <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> calls him "Narycius Heroes". 
According to the "Iliad", he led his <a href="Locrians">Locrians</a> in forty ships against <a href="Troy">Troy</a>. 
He is described as one of the great heroes among the Greeks. In battle, he wore a <a href="linen">linen</a> <a href="cuirass">cuirass</a> (), was brave and intrepid, especially skilled in throwing the spear and, next to <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, the swiftest of all the Greeks.

In the funeral games at the <a href="pyre">pyre</a> of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, he contended with <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <a href="Antilochus">Antilochus</a> for the prize in the footrace; but <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, who was hostile towards him and favored Odysseus, made him stumble and fall, so that he won only the second prize. On his return from Troy, his vessel was wrecked on the Whirling Rocks (), but he escaped upon a rock through the assistance of <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>. He would have been saved in spite of Athena, but he then audaciously declared that he would escape the dangers of the sea in defiance of the immortals. Offended by this presumption, Poseidon split the rock with his <a href="trident">trident</a> and Ajax was swallowed up by the sea.

In later traditions, this Ajax is called a son of Oileus and the <a href="nymph">nymph</a> Rhene and is also mentioned among the suitors of Helen. After the taking of Troy, he rushed into the temple of Athena, where <a href="Cassandra">Cassandra</a> had taken refuge, and was embracing the statue of the goddess in <a href="supplication">supplication</a>. Ajax violently dragged her away to the other captives. 
According to some writers, he raped Cassandra inside the temple. Odysseus, accused him of this crime and Ajax was to be stoned to death, but saved himself by establishing his innocence with an oath to Athena, clutching her statue in supplication.

Since Ajax dragged a supplicant from her temple, Athena had cause to be indignant. According to the "<a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Bibliotheca</a>", no one was aware that Ajax had raped Cassandra until <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a>, the Greek seer, warned the Greeks that Athena was furious at the treatment of her priestess and she would destroy the Greek ships if they didn't kill him immediately. Despite this, Ajax managed to hide in the altar of a deity where the Greeks, fearing divine retribution should they kill him and destroy the altar, allowed him to live. When the Greeks left without killing Ajax, despite their sacrifices, Athena became so angry that she persuaded <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> to send a storm that sank many of their ships.

When Ajax finally left Troy during the <a href="Returns%20from%20Troy">Returns from Troy</a>, Athena hit his ship with a thunderbolt, but Ajax still survived with some of his men, managing to cling onto a rock. He boasted that even the gods could not kill him and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>, upon hearing this, split the rock with his trident, causing Ajax to eventually drown. 
<a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> buried him when the corpse washed up on Myconos. Other versions depict a different death for Ajax, showing him dying when on his voyage home. In these versions, when Ajax came to the Capharean Rocks on the coast of <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>, his ship was wrecked in a fierce storm, he himself was lifted up in a whirlwind and impaled with a flash of rapid fire from Athena in his chest, and his body thrust upon sharp rocks, which afterwards were called the rocks of Ajax.

After his death, his spirit dwelt in the island of <a href="Leuce%20%28island%29">Leuce</a>. The <a href="Opuntian%20Locris">Opuntian</a> Locrians worshiped Ajax as their national hero, and so great was their faith in him that when they drew up their army in battle, they always left one place open for him, believing that, although invisible to them, he was fighting for and among them. The story of Ajax was frequently made use of by ancient poets and artists, and the hero who appears on some Locrian coins with the helmet, shield, and sword is probably this Ajax.

Other accounts of his death are offered by <a href="Philostratus%20III">Philostratus</a> and the <a href="scholiast">scholiast</a> on <a href="Lycophron">Lycophron</a>.

The abduction of Cassandra by Ajax was frequently represented in <a href="Art%20in%20ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> works of art, such as the chest of <a href="Cypselus">Cypselus</a> described by <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> and in extant works.

Ajax (mythology)

Ajax or Aias ( or ; , gen. Αἴαντος "Aiantos") is a <a href="Greek%20mythology">mythological Greek hero</a>, the son of King <a href="Telamon">Telamon</a> and <a href="Periboea">Periboea</a>, and the half-brother of <a href="Teucer">Teucer</a>. He plays an important role, and is portrayed as a towering figure and a warrior of great courage in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and in the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">Epic Cycle</a>, a series of <a href="epic%20poems">epic poems</a> about the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. He is also referred to as "Telamonian Ajax", "Greater Ajax", or "Ajax the Great", which distinguishes him from Ajax, son of Oileus (<a href="Ajax%20the%20Lesser">Ajax the Lesser</a>). In <a href="Etruscan%20mythology">Etruscan mythology</a>, he is known as Aivas Tlamunus.

Ajax is the son of <a href="Telamon">Telamon</a>, who was the son of <a href="Aeacus">Aeacus</a> and grandson of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, and his first wife Periboea. He is the cousin of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, and is the elder <a href="Sibling">half-brother</a> of <a href="Teucer">Teucer</a>. Many illustrious <a href="Athenians">Athenians</a>, including <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>, <a href="Miltiades%20the%20Younger">Miltiades</a>, <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a> and the historian <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, traced their descent from Ajax. On an Etruscan tomb dedicated to Racvi Satlnei in Bologna (5th century BC) there is an inscription that says, "aivastelmunsl" which means "family of Telamonian Ajax".

In Homer's "Iliad" he is described as of great stature, colossal frame and strongest of all the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a>. Known as the "bulwark of the Achaeans", he was trained by the <a href="centaur">centaur</a> <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a> (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and Achilles' father <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a> and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as Achilles. He was described as fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence. Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the "Iliad", and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength. Unlike <a href="Diomedes">Diomedes</a> and <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>, Ajax appears as a mainly defensive warrior, instrumental in the defence of the Greek camp and ships and that of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>' body. When the Trojans are on the offensive, he is often seen covering the retreat of the Achaeans. Significantly, while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem, Ajax has no <a href="aristeia">aristeia</a> depicting him on the offensive.

In the "Iliad", Ajax is notable for his abundant strength and courage, seen particularly in two fights with <a href="Hector">Hector</a>. In pageRank.Book 7, Ajax is chosen by lot to meet Hector in a duel which lasts most of a whole day. Ajax at first gets the better of the encounter, wounding Hector with his spear and knocking him down with a large stone, but Hector fights on until the <a href="herald">herald</a>s, acting at the direction of Zeus, call a draw, with the two combatants exchanging gifts, Ajax giving Hector a purple sash and Hector giving Ajax his sharp sword.

The second fight between Ajax and Hector occurs when the latter breaks into the Mycenaean camp, and fights with the Greeks among the ships. In pageRank.Book 14, Ajax throws a giant rock at Hector which almost kills him. In pageRank.Book 15, Hector is restored to his strength by <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and returns to attack the ships. Ajax, wielding an enormous spear as a weapon and leaping from ship to ship, holds off the <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> armies virtually single-handedly. In pageRank.Book 16, Hector and Ajax duel once again. Hector then disarms Ajax (although Ajax is not hurt) and Ajax is forced to retreat, seeing that Zeus is clearly favoring Hector. Hector and the Trojans succeed in burning one Greek ship, the culmination of an assault that almost finishes the war. Ajax is responsible for the death of many Trojans lords, including <a href="Phorcys%20%28Trojan%20War%29">Phorcys</a>.

Ajax often fought in tandem with his brother Teucer, known for his skill with the bow. Ajax would wield his magnificent shield, as Teucer stood behind picking off enemy Trojans.

Achilles was absent during these encounters because of his feud with Agamemnon. In pageRank.Book 9, Agamemnon and the other Mycenaean chiefs send Ajax, <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <a href="Phoenix%20%28son%20of%20Amyntor%29">Phoenix</a> to the tent of Achilles in an attempt to reconcile with the great warrior and induce him to return to the fight. Although Ajax speaks earnestly and is well received, he does not succeed in convincing Achilles.

When Patroclus is killed, Hector tries to steal his body. Ajax, assisted by <a href="Menelaus">Menelaus</a>, succeeds in fighting off the Trojans and taking the body back with his chariot; however, the Trojans had already stripped Patroclus of Achilles' armor. Ajax's prayer to Zeus to remove the fog that has descended on the battle to allow them to fight or die in the light of day has become proverbial. According to <a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a>, in total, Ajax killed 28 people at Troy.

Like most of the other Greek leaders, Ajax is alive and well as the "Iliad" comes to a close. When Achilles dies, killed by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> (with help from Apollo), Ajax and Odysseus are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion, Patroclus. Ajax, with his great shield and spear, manages to recover the body and carry it to the ships, while Odysseus fights off the Trojans. After the burial, each claims Achilles' magical armor for himself as recognition for his heroic efforts. After several days of competition, Odysseus and Ajax are tied for the ownership of the divine armor, which had been forged on <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> by the smith-god <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a>. It is then that a competition is held to determine who deserves the armor. Ajax argues that because of his strength and the fighting he has done for the Greeks, including saving the ships from Hector, and driving him off with a massive rock, he deserves the armor. However, Odysseus proves to be more eloquent, and with the aid of Athena, the council gives him the armor. Ajax, "Unconquered", and furious, becomes crazed and commits outrages against the Achaians' herds of captured livestock, and falls upon his own sword, "conquered by his [own] sorrow". 
The <a href="Belvedere%20Torso">Belvedere Torso</a>, a marble torso now in the Vatican Museums, is considered to depict Ajax "in the act of contemplating his suicide".

In Sophocles' play "<a href="Ajax%20%28Sophocles%29">Ajax</a>", a famous retelling of Ajax's demise, after the armor is awarded to Odysseus Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and Menelaus. Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision, and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them, imagining they are the Achaean leaders, including Odysseus and Agamemnon. When he comes to his senses, covered in blood, he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor, and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame. He does so with the same sword which Hector gave him when they exchanged presents. From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of <a href="Hyacinth%20%28mythology%29">Hyacinthus</a>, which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name "Ai," also expressive of lament. His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the <a href="Rhoiteion%23The%20Tomb%20of%20Ajax">Rhoetean</a> promontory at the entrance of the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>.

Ajax's half-brother Teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or famous weapons back. Teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence. He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home, the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens.

Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over Achilles' armor; when Odysseus visits <a href="Hades">Hades</a>, he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him, but Ajax, still resentful over the old quarrel, refuses and descends silently back into <a href="Erebus">Erebus</a>.

Like Achilles, he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the <a href="Snake%20Island%20%28Black%20Sea%29">island of Leuke</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the <a href="tutelary%20deity">tutelary hero</a> of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called "Aianteia" was celebrated in his honour. At this festival a couch was set up, on which the <a href="panoply">panoply</a> of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman <a href="Lectisternium">Lectisternium</a>. The identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion <a href="Solon">Solon</a> is said to have inserted a line in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" (2.557–558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island. Ajax then became an <a href="Attica">Attic</a> hero; he was worshiped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe "Aiantis" was named after him. Pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton, its kneecap in diameter, appeared on the beach near <a href="Sigeion">Sigeion</a>, on the Trojan coast; these bones were identified as those of Ajax.

There is <a href="Ajaccio%23Toponymy">a legend</a> that Ajax founded the city of <a href="Ajaccio">Ajaccio</a> in the mediterranean island of <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> (now part of France) and gave it his name.

In 2001, Yannos Lolos began excavating a <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> palace on the island of Salamis which he supposed to be the home of the mythological Aiacid dynasty. The ruins have been excavated at a site near the village of Kanakia of Salamis, a few miles off the coast of Athens. The multi-story structure covers and had perhaps 30 rooms. The Trojan War is supposed by many to have occurred at the height of the Mycenaean civilization (see discussion of <a href="Troy%20VII">Troy VII</a>), roughly the point at which this palace appears to have been abandoned.

Alaric I

Alaric I ( - "supreme chief/ruler"; ; 370 (or 375)410 AD) was the first <a href="Germanic%20Kingship">King</a> of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> from 395–410, son (or paternal grandson) of chieftain <a href="Rothestes">Rothestes</a>. Alaric is best known for his <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">sack of Rome</a> in 410, which marked a decisive event in the <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">decline</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

Alaric began his career under the Goth soldiers <a href="Gainas">Gainas</a> and later joined the Roman army. Alaric's first appearance was as the leader of a mixed band of <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and allied peoples who invaded <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> in 391 and were stopped by the half-<a href="Vandal">Vandal</a> Roman General <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>. In 394 he led a Gothic force of 20,000 that helped the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Emperor">Eastern Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius</a> defeat the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> usurper <a href="Arbogast%20%28general%29">Arbogast</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Frigidus">Battle of Frigidus</a>. Despite sacrificing around 10,000 of his men, Alaric received little recognition from the Emperor. Disappointed, he left the army and was elected <a href="reiks">reiks</a> of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in 395, and marched toward <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> until he was diverted by Roman forces. He then moved southward into <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, where he sacked <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> (the port of <a href="Athens">Athens</a>) and destroyed <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, <a href="Megara">Megara</a>, <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>. As a response, the Eastern emperor <a href="Flavius%20Arcadius">Flavius Arcadius</a> appointed Alaric <a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a> ("master of the soldiers") in <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Illyricum">Illyricum</a>.

In 401 Alaric invaded Italy, but he was defeated by <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollentia">Pollentia</a> (modern Pollenza) on April6, 402. A second invasion that same year also ended in defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verona%20%28402%29">Battle of Verona</a>, though Alaric forced the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a> to pay a large subsidy to the Visigoths. During <a href="Radagaisus">Radagaisus</a>' Italian invasion in 406, Alaric remained idle in <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>. In 408, <a href="Western%20Emperor">Western Emperor</a> <a href="Flavius%20Honorius">Flavius Honorius</a> ordered the execution of Stilicho and his family, amid rumours that the general had made a deal with Alaric. Honorius then incited the Roman population to massacre tens of thousands of wives and children of <a href="foederati">foederati</a> Goths serving in the Roman military. Subsequently, around 30,000 Gothic soldiers defected to Alaric, and joined his march on Rome to avenge their murdered families.

Moving swiftly along <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a>s, Alaric sacked the cities of <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> and <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a> and ravaged the lands along the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. The Visigothic leader thereupon laid siege to Rome in 408. Eventually, the Senate granted him a substantial subsidy. In addition, Alaric forced the Senate to liberate all 40,000 <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> slaves in Rome. Honorius, however, refused to appoint Alaric as the commander of the Western Roman Army, and in 409 the Visigoths again surrounded Rome. Alaric lifted his blockade after proclaiming <a href="Priscus%20Attalus">Attalus</a> <a href="Western%20Emperor">Western Emperor</a>. Attalus appointed him <a href="magister%20utriusque%20militiae">magister utriusque militiae</a> ("master of both services") but refused to allow him to send an army into <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Negotiations with Honorius broke down, and Alaric deposed Attalus in the summer of 410, and besieged Rome for the third time. Allies within the capital opened the gates for him on August24, and for three days his troops <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">sacked the city</a>. Although the Visigoths plundered Rome, they treated its inhabitants humanely and burned only a few buildings. Having abandoned a plan to occupy <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> after the destruction of his fleet in a storm, Alaric died as the Visigoths were marching northward.

Born on <a href="Peuce%20Island">Peuce Island</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Danube%20Delta">Danube Delta</a> in present-day <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, Alaric belonged to the noble <a href="Balti%20dynasty">Balti dynasty</a> of the <a href="Thervingi">Tervingian</a> <a href="Goths">Goths</a>. The Goths suffered setbacks against the <a href="Huns">Huns</a>, made a mass migration across the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, and fought a <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28376%E2%80%93382%29">war with Rome</a>. Alaric was probably a child during this period.

During the fourth century, the <a href="Roman%20emperors">Roman emperors</a> commonly employed "<a href="foederati">foederati</a>": <a href="irregular%20military">irregular troops</a> under Roman command, but organized by tribal structures. To spare the provincial populations from excessive taxation and to save money, emperors began to employ units recruited from Germanic tribes. The largest of these contingents was that of the Goths, who in 382 (376 in some sources), had been allowed to settle within the imperial boundaries, keeping a large degree of autonomy.

In 394 Alaric served as a leader of "foederati" under <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> in the campaign which crushed the usurper <a href="Eugenius">Eugenius</a>. As the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Frigidus">Battle of the Frigidus</a>, which terminated this campaign, was fought at the passes of the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a>, Alaric probably learned the weakness of <a href="Italy">Italy's</a> natural defences on its northeastern frontier at the head of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>.

Theodosius died in 395, leaving the Empire to be divided between his two sons <a href="Arcadius">Arcadius</a> and <a href="Flavius%20Augustus%20Honorius">Honorius</a>, the former taking <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">the eastern</a> and the latter <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">the western portion</a> of the Empire. Arcadius showed little interest in ruling, leaving most of the actual power to his <a href="Praetorian%20Prefect">Praetorian Prefect</a> <a href="Rufinus%20%28Byzantine%20official%29">Rufinus</a>. Honorius was still a minor; as his guardian, Theodosius had appointed the "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>. Stilicho also claimed to be the guardian of Arcadius, causing much rivalry between the western and eastern courts.

According to <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> in "<a href="The%20History%20of%20the%20Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a>", during the shifting of offices that took place at the beginning of the new reigns, Alaric apparently hoped he would be promoted from a mere commander to the rank of general in one of the regular armies. He was denied the promotion, however. Among the Visigoths settled in Lower <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> (now part of Bulgaria and Romania), the situation was ripe for rebellion. They had suffered disproportionately great losses at Frigidus. According to rumour, exposing the Visigoths in battle was a convenient way of weakening the Gothic tribes. This, combined with their post-battle rewards, prompted them to raise Alaric "on a shield" and proclaim him king; according to <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, a 6th-century Roman bureaucrat of Gothic origin who later turned his hand to history, both the new king and his people decided "rather to seek new kingdoms by their own work, than to slumber in peaceful subjection to the rule of others."

Alaric struck first at the eastern empire. He marched to the neighborhood of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> but, finding himself unable to undertake a siege, retraced his steps westward and then marched southward through <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> and the unguarded pass of <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> into <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

The armies of the eastern empire were occupied with <a href="Huns">Hunnic</a> incursions in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>. Instead, Rufinus attempted to negotiate with Alaric in person, which only aroused suspicions in Constantinople that Rufinius was in league with the Goths. Stilicho now marched east against Alaric. According to <a href="Claudian">Claudian</a>, Stilicho was in a position to destroy the Goths when he was ordered by Arcadius to leave <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Illyricum">Illyricum</a>. Soon after, Rufinus' own soldiers hacked him to death. Power in Constantinople now passed to the eunuch Chamberlain <a href="Eutropius%20%28Byzantine%20official%29">Eutropius</a>.

Rufinus' death and Stilicho's departure gave free rein to Alaric's movements; he ravaged <a href="Attica">Attica</a> but spared <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, which capitulated at once to the conqueror. In 396, he wiped out the last remnants of the <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Mysteries at Eleusis</a> in Attica, ending a tradition of esoteric religious ceremonies that had lasted since the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. Then he penetrated into the <a href="Peloponnesus">Peloponnesus</a> and captured its most famous cities—<a href="Corinth%2C%20Greece">Corinth</a>, <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20Sparta">Sparta</a>—selling many of their inhabitants into slavery.

Here, however, his victorious career suffered a serious setback. In 397 Stilicho crossed the sea to Greece and succeeded in trapping the Goths in the mountains of <a href="Pholoe">Pholoe</a>, on the borders of <a href="Elis">Elis</a> and <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a> in the peninsula. From there Alaric escaped with difficulty, and not without some suspicion of connivance by Stilicho, who supposedly had again received orders to depart. Alaric then crossed the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Corinth">Gulf of Corinth</a> and marched with the plunder of <a href="Greece">Greece</a> northward to <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a>. Here his rampage continued until the eastern government appointed him "magister militum per Illyricum", giving him the Roman command he had desired, as well as the authority to resupply his men from the imperial arsenals.

It was probably in 401 that Alaric made his first invasion of Italy, originally with the intention to petition for a position closer to Rome. Alaric had a fascination for the 'golden age' of Rome and insisted on his tribesmen calling him 'Alaricus'. Supernatural influences were not lacking to urge him to this great enterprise. Some lines of the Roman poet <a href="Claudian">Claudian</a> inform us that he heard a voice proceeding from a <a href="sacred%20grove">sacred grove</a>, "Break off all delays, Alaric. This very year thou shalt force the Alpine barrier of Italy; thou shalt penetrate to the city." But the prophecy was not to be fulfilled at this time. After spreading desolation through North <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and striking terror into the citizens of Rome, Alaric was met by <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a> at <a href="Pollentia">Pollentia</a>, today in <a href="Piedmont%20%28Italy%29">Piedmont</a>. The battle which followed on April 6, 402 (coinciding with Easter), was a victory for Rome, though a costly one. But it effectively halted the Goths' progress.

Stilicho's enemies later reproached him for having gained his victory by taking impious advantage of the great Christian festival. Alaric, too, was outwardly a Christian, though an <a href="Arianism">Arian</a>, not <a href="Chalcedonian%20Christianity">Orthodox</a> though he continued to practice the Pagan rituals of his ancestors as well as observing Christian ritual practices. He had trusted to the sanctity of Easter for immunity from attack.

Alaric's wife was reportedly taken prisoner after this battle; it is not unreasonable to suppose that he and his troops were hampered by the presence of large numbers of women and children, which gave his invasion of Italy the character of a <a href="human%20migration">human migration</a>.

After another defeat before <a href="Verona%2C%20Italy">Verona</a>, Alaric left Italy, probably in 403. He had not "penetrated to the city" but his invasion of Italy had produced important results. It caused the imperial residence to be transferred from <a href="Milan">Milan</a> to <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, and necessitated the withdrawal of <a href="Legio%20XX%20Valeria%20Victrix">Legio XX "Valeria Victrix"</a> from Britain.

Alaric became the friend and ally of his erstwhile opponent, <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a>. By 407, the estrangement between the eastern and western courts had become so bitter that it threatened civil war. Stilicho actually proposed using Alaric's troops to enforce Honorius' claim to the <a href="prefecture">prefecture</a> of Illyricum. The death of Arcadius in May 408 caused milder counsel to prevail in the western court, but Alaric, who had actually entered Epirus, demanded in a somewhat threatening manner that if he were thus suddenly requested to desist from war, he should be paid handsomely for what modern language would call the "expenses of <a href="mobilization">mobilization</a>". The sum which he named was a large one, 4,000 pounds of gold. Under strong pressure from Stilicho, the Roman Senate consented to promise its payment.

But three months later, Stilicho and the chief ministers of his party were treacherously slain on Honorius' orders. In the unrest that followed throughout Italy, the wives and children of the foederati were slain. Consequently, these 30,000 men flocked to Alaric's camp, clamouring to be led against their cowardly enemies. He accordingly led them across the Julian Alps and, in September 408, stood before the walls of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> (now with no capable general like Stilicho as a defender) and began a strict blockade.

No blood was shed this time; Alaric relied on hunger as his most powerful weapon. When the ambassadors of the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a>, entreating for peace, tried to intimidate him with hints of what the despairing citizens might accomplish, he laughed and gave his celebrated answer: "The thicker the hay, the easier mowed!" After much bargaining, the famine-stricken citizens agreed to pay a ransom of 5,000 pounds of gold, 30,000 pounds of silver, 4,000 silken tunics, 3,000 hides dyed scarlet, and 3,000 pounds of pepper. Along came 40,000 freed <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> slaves. Thus ended Alaric's first siege of Rome.

Throughout his career, Alaric's primary goal was not to undermine the Empire, but to secure for himself a regular and recognized position within the Empire's borders. His demands were certainly grand: the concession of a block of territory 200 miles long by 150 wide between the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and the Gulf of <a href="Venice">Venice</a> (to be held probably on some terms of nominal dependence on the Empire) and the title of commander-in-chief of the Imperial Army. Immense as his terms were, the emperor would have been well advised to grant them. Honorius, however, refused to see beyond his own safety, guaranteed by the dikes and marshes of <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>. As all attempts to conduct a satisfactory negotiation with this emperor failed, Alaric, after instituting a second siege and blockade of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in 409, came to terms with the Senate. With their consent, he set up a rival emperor, the prefect of the city, a Greek named <a href="Priscus%20Attalus">Priscus Attalus</a>.

Alaric cashiered his ineffectual puppet emperor after eleven months and again tried to reopen negotiations with Honorius. These negotiations might have succeeded had it not been for the influence of another Goth, <a href="Sarus%20%28Goth%29">Sarus</a>, an <a href="Amali">Amali</a>, and therefore hereditary enemy of Alaric and his house. Alaric, again outwitted by an enemy's machinations, marched southward and in deadly earnest, began his third siege of Rome. Apparently, defence was impossible; there are hints, not well substantiated, of treachery; surprise is a more likely explanation. However, this may be—for our information at this point of the story is meagre—on August 24, 410, Alaric and his Visigoths burst in by the <a href="Porta%20Salaria">Porta Salaria</a> on the northeast of the city. Rome, for so long victorious against its enemies, was now at the mercy of its foreign conquerors.

The contemporary <a href="Ecclesiology">ecclesiastics</a> recorded with wonder many instances of the Visigoths' clemency: Christian churches saved from ravage; protection granted to vast multitudes both of pagans and Christians who took refuge therein; vessels of gold and silver which were found in a private dwelling, spared because they "belonged to St. Peter"; at least one case in which a beautiful Roman matron appealed, not in vain, to the better feelings of the Gothic soldier who attempted her dishonor. But even these exceptional instances show that Rome was not entirely spared the horrors which usually accompany the storming of a besieged city. Nonetheless, the written sources do not mention damages wrought by fire, save the <a href="Gardens%20of%20Sallust">Gardens of Sallust</a>, which were situated close to the gate by which the Goths had made their entrance; nor is there any reason to attribute any extensive destruction of the buildings of the city to Alaric and his followers. The <a href="Basilica%20Aemilia">Basilica Aemilia</a> in the <a href="Roman%20Forum">Roman Forum</a> did burn down, which perhaps can be attributed to Alaric: the archaeological evidence was provided by coins dating from 410 found melted in the floor. The pagan emperors' tombs of the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">Mausoleum of Augustus</a> and <a href="Castel%20Sant%27Angelo">Castel Sant'Angelo</a> were rifled and the ashes scattered.

Alaric, having penetrated the city, marched southwards into <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a>. He desired to invade Africa, which, thanks to its grain, had become the key to holding Italy. But a storm battered his ships into pieces and many of his soldiers drowned. Alaric died soon after in <a href="Cosenza">Cosenza</a>, probably of fever, and his body was, according to legend, buried under the riverbed of the <a href="Busento">Busento</a> in accordance with the pagan practices of the Visigothic people. The stream was temporarily turned aside from its course while the grave was dug wherein the Gothic chief and some of his most precious spoils were interred. When the work was finished, the river was turned back into its usual channel and the captives by whose hands the labor had been accomplished were put to death that none might learn their secret.

Alaric was succeeded in the command of the Gothic army by his brother-in-law, <a href="Ataulf">Ataulf</a>, who married Honorius' sister <a href="Galla%20Placidia">Galla Placidia</a> three years later.

The chief authorities on the career of Alaric are: the historian <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a> and the poet <a href="Claudian">Claudian</a>, both contemporary, neither disinterested; <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a>, a historian who lived probably about half a century after Alaric's death; and <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, a Goth who wrote the history of his nation in 551, basing his work on <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>'s "<a href="Gothic%20History">Gothic History</a>". The legend of Alaric's burial in the Buzita River comes from Jordanes.

Alaric II

Alaric II (August 507) — from <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a>: *Alareiks II, also known as Alarik, Alarich, and Alarico in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> or Alaricus in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> — succeeded his father <a href="Euric">Euric</a> as king of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> on December 28, 484. He established his capital at <a href="Aire-sur-l%27Adour">Aire-sur-l'Adour</a> ("Vicus Julii") in <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. His dominions included not only the majority of <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> (excluding its northwestern corner) but also <a href="Gallia%20Aquitania">Gallia Aquitania</a> and the greater part of an as-yet undivided <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a>.

<a href="Herwig%20Wolfram">Herwig Wolfram</a> opens his chapter on the eighth Visigothic king, "Alaric's reign gets no full treatment in the sources, and the little they do contain is overshadowed by his death in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vouill%C3%A9">Battle of Vouillé</a> and the downfall of the Toulosan kingdom." One example is <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>'s account of Alaric's reign: consisting of a single paragraph, it is primarily about Alaric's death in that battle.

The earliest documented event in Alaric's reign concerned providing refuge to <a href="Syagrius">Syagrius</a>, the former ruler of the <a href="Domain%20of%20Soissons">Domain of Soissons</a> (in what is now northwestern <a href="France">France</a>) who had been defeated by <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a>, King of the Franks. According to <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>' account, Alaric was intimidated by Clovis into surrendering Syagrius to Clovis; Gregory then adds that "the Goths are a timorous race." The <a href="Franks">Franks</a> then imprisoned Syagrius, and once his control over Syagrius' former kingdom was secure, Clovis had him beheaded. However, Wolfram points out that at the time "Clovis got no farther than the Seine; only after several more years did the Franks succeed in occupying the rest of the Gallo-Roman buffer state north of the <a href="Loire">Loire</a>." Any threat of war Clovis could make would only be effective if they were neighbors; "it is nowhere written that Syagrius was handed over in 486 or 487."

Despite Frankish advances in the years that followed, Alaric was not afraid to take the military initiative when it presented itself. In 490, Alaric assisted his fellow Gothic king, <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a>, in his conquest of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> by dispatching an army to raise <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a>'s siege of <a href="Pavia">Pavia</a>, where Theodoric had been trapped. Then when the Franks attacked the <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a> in the decade after 500, Alaric assisted the ruling house, and according to Wolfram the victorious Burgundian king <a href="Gundobad">Gundobad</a> ceded <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a> to Alaric. By 502 Clovis and Alaric met on an island in the Loire near <a href="Amboise">Amboise</a> for face-to-face talks, which led to a peace treaty.

In 506, the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> captured the city of <a href="Dertosa">Dertosa</a> in the <a href="Ebro%20valley">Ebro valley</a>. There they captured the <a href="Roman%20usurper">Roman usurper</a> <a href="Peter%20%28usurper%29">Peter</a> and had him executed.

After a few years, however, Clovis violated the peace treaty negotiated in 502. Despite the diplomatic intervention of <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric</a>, king of the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> and father-in-law of Alaric, Clovis led his followers into Visigothic territory. Alaric was forced by his magnates to meet Clovis in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vouill%C3%A9">Battle of Vouillé</a> (summer 507) near Poitiers; there the Goths were defeated and Alaric slain, according to Gregory of Tours, by Clovis himself.

The most serious consequence of this battle was not the loss of their possessions in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> to the Franks; with Ostrogothic help, much of the Gallic territory was recovered, Herwig Wolfram notes, perhaps as far as <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. Nor was it the loss of the royal treasury at Toulouse, which Gregory of Tours writes Clovis took into his possession. As Peter Heather notes, the Visigothic kingdom was thrown into disarray "by the death of its king in battle." Alaric's heirs were his eldest son, the illegitimate <a href="Gesalec">Gesalec</a>, and his younger son, the legitimate <a href="Amalaric">Amalaric</a> who was still a child. Gesalec proved incompetent, and in 511 King Theodoric assumed the throne of the kingdom ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric—Heather uses the word "hijacked" to describe his action. Although Amalaric eventually became king in his own right, the political continuity of the Visigothic kingdom was broken; "Amalaric's succession was the result of new power structures, not old ones," as Heather describes it. With Amalaric's death in 531, the Visigothic kingdom entered an extended period of unrest which lasted until <a href="Leovigild">Leovigild</a> assumed the throne in 568.

In religion Alaric was an <a href="Arianism">Arian</a>, like all the early Visigothic nobles, but he greatly mitigated the persecution policy of his father Euric toward the <a href="Catholicism">Catholics</a> and authorized them to hold in 506 the council of <a href="Agde">Agde</a>. He was on uneasy terms with the Catholic bishops of <a href="Arelate">Arelate</a> (modern Arles) as epitomized in the career of the Frankish <a href="Caesarius%20of%20Arles">Caesarius, bishop of Arles</a>, who was appointed bishop in 503. Caesarius was suspected of conspiring with the <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>, whose king had married the sister of Clovis, to assist the Burgundians capture Arles. Alaric exiled him for a year to <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in Aquitania, then allowed him to return unharmed when the crisis had passed.

Alaric displayed similar wisdom in political affairs by appointing a commission headed by the <a href="referendary">referendary</a> <a href="Anianus%20%28referendary%29">Anianus</a> to prepare an abstract of the Roman laws and imperial decrees, which would form the authoritative code for his Roman subjects. This is generally known as the "Breviarium Alaricianum" or <a href="Breviary%20of%20Alaric">Breviary of Alaric</a>.

The (Alaric's Mountain) near <a href="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a> is named after the Visigoth king. Local rumour has it that he left a vast treasure buried in the caves beneath the mountain.

The (Alaric's <a href="Canal">Canal</a>) in the <a href="Hautes-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es">Hautes-Pyrénées</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> is named after him.

Albertus Magnus

Albertus Magnus, <a href="Dominican%20Order">O.P.</a> (c. 1200 – November 15, 1280), also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, was a <a href="Germans">German</a> <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> <a href="friar">friar</a> and <a href="Catholic%20bishop">bishop</a>. Later canonised as a <a href="Catholic%20saint">Catholic saint</a>, he was known during his lifetime as "Doctor universalis" and "Doctor expertus" and, late in his life, the <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> "<a href="List%20of%20people%20known%20as%20%26quot%3Bthe%20Great%26quot%3B">Magnus</a>" was appended to his name. Scholars such as James A. Weisheipl and Joachim R. Söder have referred to him as the greatest German philosopher and theologian of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> distinguishes him as one of the 36 <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctors of the Church</a>.

It seems likely that Albert was born sometime before 1200, given well-attested evidence that he was aged over 80 on his death in 1280. More than one source says that Albert was 87 on his death, which has led 1193 to be commonly given as the date of Albert's birth. Albert was probably born in <a href="Lauingen">Lauingen</a> (now in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>), since he called himself 'Albert of Lauingen', but this might simply be a family name. Most probably his family was of "ministerial" class; his familiar connection with (being son of the count) Bollstädt noble family was a 15th-century misinterpretation that is now completely disproved.

Albert was probably educated principally at the <a href="University%20of%20Padua">University of Padua</a>, where he received instruction in <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s writings. A late account by Rudolph de Novamagia refers to Albertus' encounter with the <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, who convinced him to enter <a href="Holy%20Orders">Holy Orders</a>. In 1223 (or 1229) he became a member of the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican Order</a>, and studied <a href="theology">theology</a> at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, Germany, where the Dominicans had a house, he taught for several years there, as well as in <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>, <a href="Freiburg">Freiburg</a>, <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, and <a href="Hildesheim">Hildesheim</a>. During his first tenure as lecturer at Cologne, Albert wrote his "Summa de bono" after discussion with <a href="Philip%20the%20Chancellor">Philip the Chancellor</a> concerning the transcendental properties of being. In 1245, Albert became master of theology under Gueric of Saint-Quentin, the first German Dominican to achieve this distinction. Following this turn of events, Albert was able to teach theology at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> as a full-time professor, holding the seat of the Chair of Theology at the College of St. James. During this time <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> began to study under Albertus.

Albert was the first to comment on virtually all of the writings of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, thus making them accessible to wider academic debate. The study of Aristotle brought him to study and comment on the teachings of Muslim academics, notably <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> and <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a>, and this would bring him into the heart of academic debate.

In 1254 Albert was made <a href="provincial%20superior">provincial</a> of the Dominican Order, and fulfilled the duties of the office with great care and efficiency. During his tenure he publicly defended the Dominicans against attacks by the secular and regular faculty of the University of Paris, commented on <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, and answered what he perceived as errors of the <a href="Early%20Islamic%20philosophy">Islamic philosopher</a> Averroes.

In 1259 Albert took part in the General Chapter of the Dominicans at <a href="Valenciennes">Valenciennes</a> together with Thomas Aquinas, masters Bonushomo Britto, Florentius, and Peter (later <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20V">Pope Innocent V</a>) establishing a "ratio studiorum" or program of studies for the Dominicans that featured the study of philosophy as an innovation for those not sufficiently trained to study theology. This innovation initiated the tradition of Dominican scholastic philosophy put into practice, for example, in 1265 at the Order's "studium provinciale" at the convent of <a href="Santa%20Sabina">Santa Sabina</a> in Rome, out of which would develop the <a href="Pontifical%20University%20of%20Saint%20Thomas%20Aquinas">Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>, the "Angelicum"

In 1260 <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20IV">Pope Alexander IV</a> made him <a href="bishop%20of%20Regensburg">bishop of Regensburg</a>, an office from which he resigned after three years. During the exercise of his duties he enhanced his reputation for humility by refusing to ride a horse, in accord with the dictates of the Order, instead traversing his huge diocese on foot. This earned him the affectionate sobriquet "boots the bishop" from his parishioners. In 1263 <a href="Pope%20Urban%20IV">Pope Urban IV</a> relieved him of the duties of bishop and asked him to preach the <a href="eighth%20Crusade">eighth Crusade</a> in German-speaking countries. After this, he was especially known for acting as a mediator between conflicting parties. In Cologne he is not only known for being the founder of Germany's oldest university there, but also for "the big verdict" (der Große Schied) of 1258, which brought an end to the conflict between the citizens of Cologne and the archbishop. Among the last of his labors was the defense of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas, whose death in 1274 grieved Albert (the story that he travelled to Paris in person to defend the teachings of Aquinas can not be confirmed).

After suffering a collapse of health in 1278, he died on November 15, 1280, in the Dominican convent in Cologne, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. Since November 15, 1954, his relics are in a Roman sarcophagus in the <a href="crypt">crypt</a> of the Dominican St. <a href="Andreas">Andreas</a> Church in Cologne. Although his body was discovered to be incorrupt at the first exhumation three years after his death, at the exhumation in 1483 only a skeleton remained.

Albert was <a href="beatified">beatified</a> in 1622. He was <a href="canonized">canonized</a> and proclaimed a Doctor of the Church on December 16, 1931, by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XI">Pope Pius XI</a> and the patron saint of natural scientists in 1941. St. Albert's <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> is November 15.

Albert's writings collected in 1899 went to thirty-eight volumes. These displayed his prolific habits and encyclopedic knowledge of topics such as <a href="logic">logic</a>, <a href="theology">theology</a>, <a href="botany">botany</a>, <a href="geography">geography</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, <a href="mineralogy">mineralogy</a>, <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>, <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, <a href="physiology">physiology</a>, <a href="phrenology">phrenology</a>, <a href="justice">justice</a>, <a href="law">law</a>, <a href="friendship">friendship</a>, and <a href="love">love</a>. He digested, interpreted, and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. Most modern knowledge of Aristotle was preserved and presented by Albert.

His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on the Books of the Sentences of <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a> ("Magister Sententiarum"), and the "Summa Theologiae" in two volumes. The latter is in substance a more didactic repetition of the former.

Albert's activity, however, was more philosophical than theological (see <a href="Scholasticism">Scholasticism</a>). The philosophical works, occupying the first six and the last of the 21 volumes, are generally divided according to the <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and condensations of Aristotle's relative works, with supplementary discussions upon contemporary topics, and occasional divergences from the opinions of the master. Albert believed that Aristotle's approach to natural philosophy did not pose any obstacle to the development of a Christian philosophical view of the natural order.

Albert's knowledge of physical science was considerable and for the age remarkably accurate. His industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many gaps which are characteristic of scholastic philosophy, his protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and exposition. An exception to this general tendency is his Latin treatise "De falconibus" (later inserted in the larger work, "De Animalibus", as book 23, chapter 40), in which he displays impressive actual knowledge of a) the differences between the <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> and the other kinds of birds; b) the different kinds of <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s; c) the way of preparing them for the <a href="Hunting">hunt</a>; and d) the cures for sick and wounded falcons. His scholarly legacy justifies his contemporaries' bestowing upon him the honourable surname "Doctor Universalis."

In "De Mineralibus" Albert claims, "The aim of natural philosophy (science) is not simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature." Aristotelianism greatly influences Albert's view on nature and philosophy. Another example of his reason to formally search for the causes is in his treatises on plants, he begins with the principle, experiment is the only safe guide in such investigations. His studies of Aristotle and theology show their colors in nearly all of his works and volumes.

Albert placed emphasis on experiment as well as investigation, but he respected authority and tradition so much that many of his investigations or experiments were unpublished. Albert would often keep silent about many issues such as astronomy, physics and such because he felt that his theories were too advanced for the time in which he was living.

In the centuries since his death, many stories arose about Albert as an <a href="Alchemy">alchemist</a> and magician. "Much of the modern confusion results from the fact that later works, particularly the alchemical work known as the "Secreta Alberti" or the "Experimenta Alberti", were falsely attributed to Albertus by their authors to increase the prestige of the text through association." On the subject of alchemy and chemistry, many treatises relating to alchemy have been attributed to him, though in his authentic writings he had little to say on the subject, and then mostly through commentary on Aristotle. For example, in his commentary, "De mineralibus", he refers to the power of stones, but does not elaborate on what these powers might be. A wide range of Pseudo-Albertine works dealing with alchemy exist, though, showing the belief developed in the generations following Albert's death that he had mastered alchemy, one of the fundamental sciences of the Middle Ages. These include "Metals and Materials"; the "Secrets of Chemistry"; the "Origin of Metals"; the "Origins of Compounds", and a "Concordance "which is a collection of "Observations on the <a href="philosopher%27s%20stone">philosopher's stone</a>"; and other alchemy-chemistry topics, collected under the name of "Theatrum Chemicum". He is credited with the discovery of the element <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> and experimented with photosensitive chemicals, including <a href="silver%20nitrate">silver nitrate</a>. He did believe that stones had occult properties, as he related in his work "De mineralibus". However, there is scant evidence that he personally performed alchemical experiments.

According to legend, Albert is said to have discovered the philosopher's stone and passed it on to his pupil Thomas Aquinas, shortly before his death. Albert does not confirm he discovered the stone in his writings, but he did record that he witnessed the creation of gold by "transmutation." Given that Thomas Aquinas died six years before Albert's death, this legend as stated is unlikely.

Albert was deeply interested in astrology, as has been articulated by scholars such as Paola Zambelli. Throughout the Middle Ages –and well into the early modern period –astrology was widely accepted by scientists and intellectuals who held the view that life on earth is effectively a microcosm within the macrocosm (the latter being the cosmos itself). It was believed that correspondence therefore exists between the two and thus the celestial bodies follow patterns and cycles analogous to those on earth. With this worldview, it seemed reasonable to assert that astrology could be used to predict the probable future of a human being. Albert made this a central component of his philosophical system, arguing that an understanding of the celestial influences affecting us could help us to live our lives more in accord with Christian precepts. The most comprehensive statement of his astrological beliefs is to be found in a work he authored around 1260, now known as the "<a href="Speculum%20astronomiae">Speculum astronomiae</a>". However, details of these beliefs can be found in almost everything he wrote, from his early "De natura boni" to his last work, the "Summa theologiae".

Albert believed that all natural things were compositions of matter and form, he referred to it as "quod est" and "quo est". Albert also believed that God alone is the absolute ruling entity. Albert's version of <a href="hylomorphism">hylomorphism</a> is very similar to the <a href="Aristotelianism">Aristotelian</a> doctrine.

Albert is known for his commentary on the musical practice of his times. Most of his written musical observations are found in his commentary on Aristotle's "Poetics". He rejected the idea of "<a href="Musica%20universalis">music of the spheres</a>" as ridiculous: movement of astronomical bodies, he supposed, is incapable of generating sound. He wrote extensively on proportions in music, and on the three different subjective levels on which <a href="plainchant">plainchant</a> could work on the human soul: purging of the impure; illumination leading to contemplation; and nourishing perfection through contemplation. Of particular interest to 20th-century music theorists is the attention he paid to silence as an integral part of music.

Both of his early treatises, "De natura boni" and "De bono", start with a metaphysical investigation into the concepts of the good in general and the physical good. Albert refers to the physical good as "bonum naturae". Albert does this before directly dealing with the moral concepts of metaphysics. In Albert's later works, he says in order to understand human or moral goodness, the individual must first recognize what it means to be good and do good deeds. This procedure reflects Albert's preoccupations with neo-Platonic theories of good as well as the doctrines of <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>. Albert's view was highly valued by the Catholic Church and his peers.

Albert devoted the last tractatus of "De Bono" to a theory of justice and <a href="natural%20law">natural law</a>. Albert places God as the pinnacle of justice and natural law. God legislates and divine authority is supreme. Up until his time, it was the only work specifically devoted to natural law written by a theologian or philosopher.

Albert mentions friendship in his work, "De bono", as well as presenting his ideals and morals of friendship in the very beginning of "Tractatus II". Later in his life he published "Super Ethica". With his development of friendship throughout his work it is evident that friendship ideals and morals took relevance as his life went on. Albert comments on Aristotle's view of friendship with a quote from <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, who writes, "friendship is nothing other than the harmony between things divine and human, with goodwill and love". Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement. Albert calls this harmony, "consensio", itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful ("utile"), the pleasurable ("delectabile") and the authentic or unqualified good ("honestum"). Then in turn there are three levels of friendship based on each of those levels, namely friendship based on usefulness ("amicitia utilis"), friendship based on pleasure ("amicitia delectabilis"), and friendship rooted in unqualified goodness ("amicitia honesti"; "amicitia quae fundatur super honestum").

Such a feat was also <a href="Roger%20Bacon%23In%20fiction">attributed to Roger Bacon</a>.

Albert is frequently mentioned by <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>, who made his doctrine of <a href="free%20will">free will</a> the basis of his ethical system. In his "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>", Dante places Albertus with his pupil Thomas Aquinas among the great lovers of wisdom ("Spiriti Sapienti") in the Heaven of the Sun. Albert is also mentioned, along with <a href="Heinrich%20Cornelius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a> and <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>, in <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", in which his writings influence a young <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Victor Frankenstein</a>.

In "<a href="The%20Concept%20of%20Anxiety">The Concept of Anxiety</a>", <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a> wrote that Albert, "arrogantly boasted of his speculation before the deity and suddenly became stupid." Kierkegaard cites <a href="Gotthard%20Oswald%20Marbach">Gotthard Oswald Marbach</a> whom he quotes as saying ""Albertus repente ex asino factus philosophus et ex philosopho asinus"" [Albert was suddenly transformed from an ass into a philosopher and from a philosopher into an ass].

Alboin

Alboin (530sJune 28, 572) was king of the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> from about 560 until 572. During his reign the Lombards ended their <a href="migration%20period">migrations</a> by settling in Italy, the northern part of which Alboin conquered between 569 and 572. He had a lasting effect on Italy and the <a href="Pannonian%20Basin">Pannonian Basin</a>; in the former his invasion marked the beginning of centuries of Lombard rule, and in the latter his defeat of the <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a> and his departure from <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> ended the dominance there of the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a>.

The period of Alboin's reign as king in Pannonia following the death of his father, <a href="Audoin">Audoin</a>, was one of confrontation and conflict between the Lombards and their main neighbors, the Gepids. The Gepids initially gained the upper hand, but in 567, thanks to his alliance with the <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a>, Alboin inflicted a decisive defeat on his enemies, whose lands the Avars subsequently occupied. The increasing power of his new neighbours caused Alboin some unease however, and he therefore decided to leave Pannonia for Italy, hoping to take advantage of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>'s reduced ability to defend its territory in the wake of the <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29">Gothic War</a>.

After gathering a large coalition of peoples, Alboin crossed the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a> in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly took control of most of <a href="Venetia%20%28region%29">Venetia</a> and <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a>. In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. <a href="Pavia">Pavia</a> offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin turned his attention to <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.

Alboin was assassinated on June 28, 572, in a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> instigated by the Byzantines. It was organized by the king's foster brother, <a href="Helmichis">Helmichis</a>, with the support of Alboin's wife, <a href="Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29">Rosamund</a>, daughter of the Gepid king whom Alboin had killed some years earlier. The coup failed in the face of opposition from a majority of the Lombards, who elected <a href="Cleph">Cleph</a> as Alboin's successor, forcing Helmichis and Rosamund to flee to <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> under imperial protection. Alboin's death deprived the Lombards of the only leader who could have kept the newborn Germanic entity together, the last in the line of hero-kings who had led the Lombards through their migrations from the vale of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> to Italy. For many centuries following his death Alboin's heroism and his success in battle were celebrated in Saxon and Bavarian epic poetry.

The Lombards under King <a href="Wacho">Wacho</a> had migrated towards the east into Pannonia, taking advantage of the difficulties facing the <a href="Ostrogothic%20Kingdom">Ostrogothic Kingdom</a> in Italy following the death of its founder, <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric</a> in 526. Wacho's death in about 540 brought his son <a href="Walthari">Walthari</a> to the throne, but as the latter was still a minor the kingdom was governed in his stead by Alboin's father, Audoin, of the <a href="Gausian%20dynasty">Gausian</a> clan. Seven years later Walthari died, giving Audoin the opportunity to crown himself and overthrow the reigning <a href="Lethings">Lethings</a>.

Alboin was probably born in the 530s in Pannonia, the son of Audoin and his wife, <a href="Rodelinda%20%286th%20century%29">Rodelinda</a>. She may have been the niece of King Theodoric and betrothed to Audoin through the mediation of Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a>. Like his father, Alboin was raised a pagan, although Audoin had at one point attempted to gain Byzantine support against his neighbours by professing himself a Christian. Alboin took as his first wife the Christian <a href="Chlothsind">Chlothsind</a>, daughter of the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> King <a href="Chlothar%20I">Chlothar</a>. This marriage, which took place soon after the death of the Frankish ruler <a href="Theudebald">Theudebald</a> in 555, is thought to reflect Audoin's decision to distance himself from the Byzantines, traditional allies of the Lombards, who had been lukewarm when it came to supporting Audoin against the Gepids. The new Frankish alliance was important because of the Franks' known hostility to the Byzantine empire, providing the Lombards with more than one option. However, the "<a href="Prosopography%20of%20the%20Later%20Roman%20Empire">Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire</a>" interprets events and sources differently, believing that Alboin married Chlothsind when already a king in or shortly before 561, the year of Chlothar's death.

Alboin first distinguished himself on the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asfeld">Battle of Asfeld</a> (552), he killed <a href="Turismod">Turismod</a>, son of the Gepid king <a href="Thurisind">Thurisind</a>, in a victory that resulted in the Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a>, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. <a href="Walter%20Goffart">Walter Goffart</a> believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed as merely a typical "<a href="Literary%20topos">topos</a>" of an <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a>.

Alboin came to the throne after the death of his father, sometime between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by <a href="Cunimund">Cunimund</a>, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian <a href="Menander%20Protector">Menander Protector</a> places the blame on Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian <a href="Walter%20Pohl">Walter Pohl</a>.

An account of the war by the Byzantine <a href="Theophylact%20Simocatta">Theophylact Simocatta</a> sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, claiming it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter <a href="Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29">Rosamund</a>, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the "<a href="Origo%20Gentis%20Langobardorum">Origo Gentis Langobardorum</a>", where she was captured only after the death of her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor <a href="Justin%20II">Justin II</a> sent his son-in-law <a href="Baduarius">Baduarius</a> as "<a href="magister%20militum">magister militum</a>" (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.

Faced with the possibility of annihilation, Alboin made an alliance in 566 with the <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a> under <a href="Bayan%20I">Bayan I</a>, at the expense of some tough conditions: the Avars demanded a tenth of the Lombards' cattle, half of the war booty, and on the war's conclusion all of the lands held by the Gepids. The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from the foreign policy of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.

In 567 the allies made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the northwest while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the <a href="Timi%C5%9F%20River">Tibiscus</a> and <a href="Danube%20River">Danube</a> rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the "Origo". The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased to exist as an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars. Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids. The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.

Despite his success against the Gepids, Alboin had failed to greatly increase his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, even though there are indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called <a href="Plague%20of%20Justinian">Plague of Justinian</a> had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the <a href="Three-Chapter%20Controversy">Three-Chapter Controversy</a> sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, <a href="Narses">Narses</a>, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a>, <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a>, <a href="Thuringii">Thuringii</a>, <a href="Bulgars">Bulgars</a>, <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a>, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King <a href="Sigebert%20I">Sigebert</a>, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.

The precise size of the heterogeneous group gathered by Alboin is impossible to know, and many different estimates have been made. <a href="Neil%20Christie">Neil Christie</a> considers 150,000–500,000 to be a realistic size, a number which would make the Lombards a more numerous force than the Ostrogoths on the eve of their invasion of Italy. Jörg Jarnut proposes 100,000–150,000 as an approximation; Wilfried Menghen in "Die Langobarden" estimates 150,000 to 200,000; while Stefano Gasparri cautiously judges the peoples united by Alboin to be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000.

As a precautionary move Alboin strengthened his alliance with the Avars, signing what Paul calls a "foedus perpetuum" ("perpetual treaty") and what is referred to in the 9th-century "<a href="Historia%20Langobardorum%20codicis%20Gothani">Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani</a>" as a "pactum et foedus amicitiae" ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200 years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.

A further cause of the Lombard migration into Italy may have been an invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as "<a href="foederati">foederati</a>", to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.

The Lombard migration started on Easter Monday, April 2, 568. The decision to combine the departure with a Christian celebration can be understood in the context of Alboin's recent conversion to <a href="Arianism">Arian Christianity</a>, as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as "foederati". It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.

The season chosen for leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples generally waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves time to do the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety induced by the neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.

The road followed by Alboin to reach Italy has been the subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the <a href="Ptuj">Poetovio</a> – <a href="Celje">Celeia</a> – <a href="Emona">Emona</a> – <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Forum Iulii</a> route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting <a href="Venetia%20%28region%29">Venetia</a>, but it was probably only in 569 that the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a> were crossed at the <a href="Vipava%20Valley">Vipava Valley</a>; the eyewitness <a href="Secundus%20of%20Non">Secundus of Non</a> gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not void of difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.

The Lombards penetrated into Italy without meeting any resistance from the border troops ("<a href="Late%20Roman%20army%23Limitanei">milities limitanei</a>"). The Byzantine military resources available on the spot were scant and of dubious loyalty, and the border forts may well have been left unmanned. What seems certain is that archaeological excavations have found no sign of violent confrontation in the sites that have been excavated. This agrees with Paul the Deacon's narrative, who speaks of a Lombard takeover in <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a> "without any hindrance".

The first town to fall into the Lombards' hands was <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Forum Iulii</a> (Cividale del Friuli), the seat of the local "magister militum". Alboin chose this walled town close to the frontier to be capital of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Friuli">Duchy of Friuli</a> and made his nephew and <a href="shield%20bearer">shield bearer</a>, <a href="Gisulf%20I%20of%20Friuli">Gisulf</a>, <a href="Duke%20%28Lombard%29">duke</a> of the region, with the specific duty of defending the borders from Byzantine or Avar attacks from the east. Gisulf obtained from his uncle the right to choose for his duchy those "<a href="Fara%20%28Lombard%29">farae</a>", or clans, that he preferred.

Alboin's decision to create a duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the "<a href="comes">comes</a> <a href="civitas">civitatis</a>" (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count ("comes") to duke ("dux") and from county ("comitatus") to duchy ("ducatus") also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from the time in Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.

From Forum Iulii, Alboin next reached <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a>, the most important road junction in the northeast, and the administrative capital of Venetia. The imminent arrival of the Lombards had a considerable impact on the city's population; the <a href="List%20of%20bishops%20and%20patriarchs%20of%20Aquileia">Patriarch of Aquileia</a> <a href="Paulinus%20I%20of%20Aquileia">Paulinus</a> fled with his clergy and flock to the island of <a href="Grado%2C%20Italy">Grado</a> in Byzantine-controlled territory.

From Aquileia, Alboin took the <a href="Via%20Postumia">Via Postumia</a> and swept through Venetia, taking in rapid succession <a href="Treviso">Tarvisium</a> (Treviso), <a href="Vicenza">Vicentia</a> (Vicenza), <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, <a href="Brescia">Brixia</a> (<a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>) and <a href="Bergamo">Bergomum</a> (Bergamo). The Lombards faced difficulties only in taking <a href="Oderzo">Opitergium</a> (Oderzo), which Alboin decided to avoid, as he similarly avoided tackling the main Venetian towns closer to the coast on the <a href="Via%20Annia">Via Annia</a>, such as <a href="Altinum">Altinum</a>, <a href="Padua">Patavium</a> (Padova), <a href="Monselice">Mons Silicis</a> (Monselice), <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a>. The invasion of Venetia generated a considerable level of turmoil, spurring waves of refugees from the Lombard-controlled interior to the Byzantine-held coast, often led by their bishops, and resulting in new settlements such as <a href="Torcello">Torcello</a> and <a href="Eraclea">Heraclia</a>.

Alboin moved west in his march, invading the region of <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a> (north-west Italy) and reaching its capital <a href="Mediolanum">Mediolanum</a> (<a href="Milan">Milan</a>) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the "<a href="vicarius">vicarius</a> Italiae" (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with the administration of the <a href="diocese%20of%20Annonarian%20Italy">diocese of Annonarian Italy</a>. Archbishop <a href="Honoratus%20of%20Mediolanum">Honoratus</a>, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the "vicarius Italiae" to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of <a href="Genoa">Genua</a> (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of "dominus Italiae" (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences in the northern part of the <a href="Po%20plain">Po plain</a>, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.

Several explanations have been advanced to explain the swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It has been suggested that the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as a vital part of the empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavs</a> in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanids</a> in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.

The impact of the Lombard migration on the Late Roman aristocracy was disruptive, especially in combination with the Gothic War; the latter conflict had finished in the north only in 562, when the last Gothic stronghold, Verona, was taken. Many men of means (Paul's "possessores") either lost their lives or their goods, but the exact extent of the despoliation of the Roman aristocracy is a subject of heated debate. The clergy was also greatly affected. The Lombards were mostly pagans, and displayed little respect for the clergy and Church property. Many churchmen left their <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> to escape from the Lombards, like the two most senior bishops in the north, Honoratus and Paulinus. However, most of the <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s in the north sought an accommodation with the Lombards, as did in 569 the bishop of Tarvisium <a href="Felix%20of%20Tarvisium">Felix</a> when he journeyed to the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave river</a> to parley with Alboin, obtaining respect for the Church and its goods in return for this act of homage. It seems certain that many sees maintained an uninterrupted episcopal succession through the turmoil of the invasion and the following years. The transition was eased by the hostility existing among the northern Italian bishops towards the papacy and the empire due to the religious dispute involving the "<a href="Schism%20of%20the%20Three%20Chapters">Three-Chapter Controversy</a>". In Lombard territory, churchmen were at least sure to avoid imperial religious persecution.

In the view of Pierre Riché, the disappearance of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics in such places rarely surviving.

The first attested instance of strong resistance to Alboin's migration took place at the town of <a href="Ticinum">Ticinum</a> (<a href="Pavia">Pavia</a>), which he started to besiege in 569 and captured only after three years. The town was of strategic importance, sitting at the confluence of the rivers <a href="Po%20%28river%29">Po</a> and <a href="Ticino%20%28river%29">Ticino</a> and connected by waterways to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy and the seat of the <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Italy">Praetorian prefecture of Italy</a>. Its fall cut direct communications between the garrisons stationed on the <a href="Alpes%20Maritimae">Alpes Maritimae</a> and the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic coast</a>.

Careful to maintain the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as <a href="Aosta">Augusta Praetoria</a> (Aosta), <a href="Susa%20%28Italy%29">Segusio</a> (Susa), and the island of <a href="Comacina">Amacina</a> in the <a href="Lake%20Como">Larius Lucus</a> (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennines</a> and plundered <a href="Tuscia">Tuscia</a>, but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to <a href="Herwig%20Wolfram">Herwig Wolfram</a>, it was probably only in 578–579 that <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, although it was not completed by the time of his death.

Alboin's problems in maintaining control over his people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made it difficult for a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or "duces", who led each band ("fara") of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as "foederati" but as enemies of the Empire.

The king's disintegrating authority over his army was also manifested in the invasion of Frankish <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a> which from 569 or 570 was subject to yearly raids on a major scale. The Lombard attacks were ultimately repelled following <a href="Mummolus">Mummolus</a>' victory at <a href="Embrun%2C%20Hautes-Alpes">Embrun</a>. These attacks had lasting political consequences, souring the previously cordial Lombard-Frankish relations and opening the door to an alliance between the Empire and the Franks against the Lombards, a coalition agreed to by <a href="Guntram">Guntram</a> in about 571. Alboin is generally thought not to have been behind this invasion, but an alternative interpretation of the transalpine raids presented by Gian Piero Bognetti is that Alboin may actually have been involved in the offensive on Guntram as part of an alliance with the Frankish king of <a href="Austrasia">Austrasia</a>, <a href="Sigebert%20I">Sigebert I</a>. This view is met with scepticism by scholars such as <a href="Christopher%20Wickham">Chris Wickham</a>.

The weakening of royal authority may also have resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However it is far from certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as very little is known of <a href="Faroald%20I%20of%20Spoleto">Faroald</a> and <a href="Zotto">Zotto</a>'s respective rise to power in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Spoleto">Spoletium</a> (<a href="Spoleto">Spoleto</a>) and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Benevento">Beneventum</a> (<a href="Benevento">Benevento</a>).

Ticinum eventually fell to the Lombards in either May or June 572. Alboin had in the meantime chosen Verona as his seat, establishing himself and his treasure in a royal palace built there by Theodoric. This choice may have been another attempt to link himself with the Gothic king.

It was in this palace that Alboin was killed on June 28, 572. In the account given by Paul the Deacon, the most detailed narrative on Alboin's death, history and saga intermingle almost inextricably. Much earlier and shorter is the story told by <a href="Marius%20Aventicensis">Marius of Aventicum</a> in his "Chronica", written about a decade after Alboin's murder. According to his version the king was killed in a conspiracy by a man close to him, called <a href="Helmichis">Hilmegis</a> (Paul's Helmechis), with the connivance of the queen. Helmichis then married the widow, but the two were forced to escape to Byzantine Ravenna, taking with them the royal treasure and part of the army, which hints at the cooperation of Byzantium. <a href="Roger%20Collins">Roger Collins</a> describes Marius as an especially reliable source because of his early date and his having lived close to Lombard Italy.

Also contemporary is <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>' account presented in the "Historia Francorum", and echoed by the later <a href="Chronicle%20of%20Fredegar">Fredegar</a>. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married the daughter of a man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning him. She had previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the "Historia" and calls its account of Alboin's demise "a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity".

Elements present in Marius' account are echoed in Paul's "<a href="Historia%20Langobardorum">Historia Langobardorum</a>", which also contains distinctive features. One of the best known aspects unavailable in any other source is that of the <a href="skull%20cup">skull cup</a>. In Paul, the events that led to Alboin's downfall unfold in Verona. During a great feast, Alboin gets drunk and orders his wife Rosamund to drink from his cup, made from the skull of his father-in-law Cunimund after he had slain him in 567 and married Rosamund. Alboin "invited her to drink merrily with her father". This reignited the queen's determination to avenge her father.
The tale has been often dismissed as a fable and Paul was conscious of the risk of disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king <a href="Ratchis">Ratchis</a>. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed to be part of a <a href="shamanism">shamanistic</a> ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause of shame or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.

The episode is read in a radically different way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of the downfall of the hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.

In her plan to kill her husband she found an ally in Helmichis, the king's foster brother and "<a href="spatharios">spatharius</a>" (arms bearer). According to Paul the queen then recruited the king's "<a href="cubicularius">cubicularius</a>" (bedchamberlain), Peredeo, into the plot, after having seduced him. When Alboin retired for his midday rest on <a href="June%2028">June 28</a>, care was taken to leave the door open and unguarded. Alboin's sword was also removed, leaving him defenceless when Peredeo entered his room and killed him. Alboin's remains were allegedly buried beneath the palace steps.

Peredeo's figure and role is mostly introduced by Paul; the "Origo" had for the first time mentioned his name as "Peritheus", but there his role had been different, as he was not the assassin, but the instigator of the assassination. In the vein of his reading of the skull cup, Goffart sees Peredeo as not as a historical figure but as an allegorical character: he notes a similarity between Peredeo's name and the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> word "peritus", meaning "lost", a representation of those Lombards who entered into the service of the Empire.

Alboin's death had a lasting impact, as it deprived the Lombards of the only leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents the death of the last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and <a href="History%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian</a>s celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.

To complete the <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> and legitimize his claim to the throne, Helmichis married the queen, whose high standing arose not only from being the king's widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining Gepid nation, and as such her support was a guarantee of the Gepids' loyalty to Helmichis. The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona, where many may have opposed Alboin's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire. The Byzantines were almost certainly deeply involved in the plot. It was in their interest to stem the Lombard tide by bringing a pro-Byzantine regime into power in Verona, and possibly in the long run break the unity of the Lombards' kingdom, winning over the dukes with honors and emoluments.

The coup ultimately failed, as it met with the resistance of most of the warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke <a href="Cleph">Cleph</a> the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, taking with him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter <a href="Albsuinda">Albsuinda</a>. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>.

Cleph kept the throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a <a href="Slavery%20in%20medieval%20Europe">slave</a>. Possibly he too was killed at the instigation of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a <a href="Rule%20of%20the%20Dukes">decade of interregnum</a>, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. It was only when faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king in the person of <a href="Authari">Authari</a>, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an <a href="exarchate%20of%20Ravenna">exarch</a> in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.

The consolidation of Byzantine and Lombard dominions had long-lasting consequences for Italy, as the region was from that moment on fragmented among multiple rulers until <a href="Italian%20unification">Italian unification</a> in 1861.
