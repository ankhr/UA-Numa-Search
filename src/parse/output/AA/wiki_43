Blood libel

Blood libel (also blood accusation) is an accusation that <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s kidnapped and murdered the children of Christians in order to use their <a href="human%20blood">blood</a> as part of their <a href="religious%20ritual">religious ritual</a>s during <a href="Jewish%20holiday">Jewish holiday</a>s. Historically, these claims alongside those of <a href="well%20poisoning">well poisoning</a> and <a href="host%20desecration">host desecration</a> have been a major theme of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Europe">persecution of Jews in Europe</a>.

Blood libels typically say that Jews require human blood for the baking of <a href="matzo">matzo</a>s for <a href="Passover">Passover</a>, although this element was allegedly absent in the earliest cases which claimed that then-contemporary Jews reenacted the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion</a>. The accusations often assert that the blood of the children of <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s is especially coveted, and, historically, blood libel claims have been made in order to account for the otherwise unexplained deaths of children. In some cases, the alleged victim of <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> has become venerated as a <a href="Christian%20martyr">martyr</a>, a holy figure around whom a martyr sect might arise. Three of these <a href="William%20of%20Norwich">William of Norwich</a>, <a href="Little%20Saint%20Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a>, and <a href="Simon%20of%20Trent">Simon of Trent</a> became objects of local sects and veneration, and in some cases they were added to the <a href="General%20Roman%20Calendar">General Roman Calendar</a>. One, <a href="Gavriil%20Belostoksky">Gavriil Belostoksky</a>, was canonized by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>.

In Jewish lore, blood libels were the impetus for the creation of the by Rabbi <a href="Judah%20Loew%20ben%20Bezalel">Judah Loew ben Bezalel</a> in the 16th century. According to <a href="Walter%20Laqueur">Walter Laqueur</a>:

Altogether, there have been about 150 recorded cases of blood libel (not to mention thousands of rumors) that resulted in the arrest and killing of Jews throughout history, most of them in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. In almost every case, Jews were murdered, sometimes by a mob, sometimes following <a href="torture">torture</a> and a trial.

The term 'blood libel' can also refer to any unpleasant and damaging false accusation, and it has taken on a broader metaphorical meaning. However, this usage remains controversial and it has been protested against by Jewish groups.

The supposed torture and human sacrifice alleged in the blood libels run contrary to the teachings of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>. According to the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, <a href="God">God</a> commanded Abraham in the <a href="Binding%20of%20Isaac">Binding of Isaac</a> to sacrifice his son, but He ultimately provided a ram as a substitute. The <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> in the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> forbid <a href="murder">murder</a>. In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the <a href="Kashrut">kosher dietary laws</a> (kashrut). Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and it must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth (). According to the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Leviticus">pageRank.Book of Leviticus</a>, blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Great Temple in Jerusalem</a> (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels). Furthermore, the consumption of human flesh would violate kashrut.

While <a href="animal%20sacrifice">animal sacrifice</a> was part of the practice of ancient Judaism, the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> (<a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>) and <a href="Halakha">Jewish teachings</a> portray <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> as one of the evils that separated the <a href="Paganism">pagans</a> of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> from the Hebrews (, ). Jews were prohibited from engaging in these rituals and they were also punished for doing so (, , , ). In fact, ritual cleanliness for priests even prohibited them from being in the same room with a human corpse ().

The earliest versions of the accusation involved Jews crucifying Christian children on <a href="Easter">Easter</a>/<a href="Passover">Passover</a> because of a prophecy. There is no reference to the use of blood in unleavened matzo bread, which evolves later as a major motivation for the crime.

The earliest known example of a blood libel is from <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a> ( 460–370 BCE), who alleged that "every seven years the Jews captured a stranger, brought him to the temple in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and sacrificed him, cutting his flesh into bits." The Graeco-Egyptian author <a href="Apion">Apion</a> claimed that Jews sacrificed Greek victims in <a href="Second%20Temple">their temple</a>. This accusation is known from <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>' rebuttal of it in "<a href="Against%20Apion">Against Apion</a>". Apion states that when <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus Epiphanes</a> entered the temple in Jerusalem, he discovered a Greek captive who told him that he was being fattened for sacrifice. Every year, Apion claimed, the Jews would sacrifice a Greek and consume his flesh, at the same time swearing eternal hatred towards the Greeks. Apion's claim probably repeats ideas already in circulation because similar claims are made by <a href="Posidonius">Posidonius</a> and <a href="Apollonius%20Molon">Apollonius Molon</a> in the 1st century BC. Another example concerns the murder of a Christian boy by a group of Jewish youths. <a href="Socrates%20Scholasticus">Socrates Scholasticus</a> ( 5th Century) reported that some Jews in a drunken frolic bound a Christian child on a cross in mockery of the death of Christ and scourged him until he died.

Professor Israel Jacob Yuval of the <a href="Hebrew%20University">Hebrew University</a> of Jerusalem published an article in 1993 which argues that the blood libel may have originated in the 12th century from Christian views of Jewish behavior during the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>. Some Jews committed suicide and killed their own children rather than be subjected to forced conversions. Yuval investigated Christian reports of these events and stated that they were greatly distorted with claims that if Jews could kill their own children, they could also kill the children of Christians. Yuval rejects the blood libel story as a fantasy of some Christians which could not contain any element of truth in it due to the precarious nature of the Jewish minority's existence in Christian Europe.

In <a href="England">England</a> in 1144, the Jews of <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> were accused of <a href="Human%20sacrifice">ritual murder</a> after a boy, <a href="William%20of%20Norwich">William of Norwich</a>, was found dead with stab wounds in the woods. William's hagiographer, <a href="Thomas%20of%20Monmouth">Thomas of Monmouth</a>, claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter, because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. In 1144, England was chosen, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing. They then abducted and crucified William. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of a martyr and pilgrims bringing offerings to the local church.

This was followed by similar accusations in <a href="Harold%20of%20Gloucester">Gloucester (1168)</a>, <a href="Robert%20of%20Bury">Bury St Edmunds (1181)</a> and Bristol (1183). In 1189, the Jewish deputation attending the coronation of <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard the Lionheart</a> was attacked by the crowd. <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20England%23Massacres%20at%20London%20and%20York%20%281189%E2%80%9390%29">Massacres of Jews at London and York</a> soon followed. In 1190 on 16 March 150 Jews were attacked in York and then massacred when they took refuge in the royal castle, where Clifford's Tower now stands, with some committing suicide rather than being taken by the mob. The remains of 17 bodies thrown in a well in Norwich between the 12th and 13th century (five that were shown by DNA testing to likely be members of a single Jewish family) were very possibly killed as part of one of these pogroms.

After the death of <a href="Little%20Saint%20Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln</a>, there were a series of trials and executions of Jews. The case is mentioned by <a href="Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, and thus has become well-known. The eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a> on 31 July 1255. His body was discovered on 29 August, covered with filth, in a pit or well belonging to a Jewish man named Copin or Koppin. On being promised by John of Lexington, a judge, who happened to be present, that his life should be spared, Copin is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">King Henry III</a>, on reaching Lincoln at the beginning of October, refused to carry out the promise of John of Lexington, and had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans (Jacobs, "Jewish Ideals", pp. 192–224). Within a few decades, Jews would be <a href="Edict%20of%20Expulsion">expelled from all of England</a> in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.

The first known case outside England was in <a href="Blois">Blois</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, in 1171. This was the site of a blood libel accusation against the town's entire Jewish community that led to around 31 Jews being burned to death. The blood libel revolved around Isaac bar Eleazar, a Jewish resident of Blois, who was accused by a Christian servant of throwing a child into a watering hole. The child's body was never found, and all the Jews who lived in Blois were killed for the alleged ritual murder. Thomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in "Bonum Universale de Apibus" ii. 29, § 23, by <a href="Thomas%20of%20Cantimpr%C3%A9">Thomas of Cantimpré</a> (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote "It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations." Thomas of Cantimpré also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a>, "His blood be on us, and on our children" (), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages:

A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (""solo sanguine Christiano"").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.

Thomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression ""solo sanguine Christiano"" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering. Thomas did not mention the name of the "very learned" proselyte, but it may have been <a href="Nicholas%20Donin">Nicholas Donin</a> of <a href="La%20Rochelle">La Rochelle</a>, who in 1240 had a disputation on the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> with <a href="Yechiel%20of%20Paris">Yechiel of Paris</a>, and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas.
At <a href="Pforzheim">Pforzheim</a>, Baden, the corpse of a seven-year-old girl was found in the river by fishermen. The Jews were suspected, and when they were led to the corpse, blood allegedly began to flow from the wounds; led to it a second time, the face of the child became flushed, and both arms were raised. In addition to these miracles, there was the testimony of the daughter of the wicked woman who had sold the child to the Jews. A regular judicial examination did not take place; it is probable that the above-mentioned "wicked woman" was the murderer. That a judicial murder was then and there committed against the Jews in consequence of the accusation is evident from the manner in which the <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> "Memorbuch" and the synagogal poems refer to the incident (<a href="Siegmund%20Salfeld">Siegmund Salfeld</a>, "Das Martyrologium des Nürnberger Memorbuches" (1898), pp. 15, 128–130).

At Weissenburg, a miracle alone decided the charge against the Jews. According to the accusation, the Jews had suspended a child (whose body was found in the Lauter river) by the feet, and had opened every artery in his body to obtain all the blood. Again, supernatural claims were made: the child's wounds were said to have bled for five days, despite its treatment.

At Oberwesel, "miracles" again constituted the only evidence against the Jews. The corpse of the 11-year-old <a href="Werner%20of%20Oberwesel">Werner of Oberwesel</a> was said to have floated up the Rhine (against the current) as far as Bacharach, emitting radiance, and being invested with healing powers. In consequence, the Jews of Oberwesel and many other adjacent localities were severely persecuted during the years 1286-89. Emperor Rudolph I, to whom the Jews had appealed for protection, issued a public proclamation to the effect that great wrong had been done to the Jews, and that the corpse of Werner was to be burned and the ashes scattered to the winds.

A statement was made, in the "Chronicle" of <a href="Konrad%20Justinger">Konrad Justinger</a> of 1423, that at <a href="Bern">Bern</a> in 1294 the Jews tortured and murdered a boy called Rudolph. The historical impossibility of this widely credited story was demonstrated by Jakob Stammler, pastor of Bern, in 1888. It has been speculated whether the <a href="Kindlifresserbrunnen">Kindlifresserbrunnen</a> ("Child Eater Fountain") in Bern might refer to the alleged ritual murder of 1294.

<a href="Simon%20of%20Trent">Simon of Trent</a>, aged two, disappeared, and his father alleged that he had been kidnapped and murdered by the local Jewish community. Fifteen local Jews were sentenced to death and burned. Simon was regarded locally as a saint, although he was never canonised by the church of Rome under <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a> in 1588. His local status as a saint was removed in 1965 by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a>.

Christopher of Toledo, also known as Christopher of La Guardia or "the <a href="Holy%20Child%20of%20La%20Guardia">Holy Child of La Guardia</a>," was a four-year-old Christian boy supposedly murdered by two Jews and three <a href="Converso">Converso</a>s (converts to Christianity). In total, eight men were executed. It is now believed that this case was constructed by the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> to facilitate the <a href="Alhambra%20decree">expulsion of Jews from Spain</a>. He was canonized by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> in 1805. Christopher has since been removed from the canon.

In a case at Tyrnau (Nagyszombat, today <a href="Trnava">Trnava</a>, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>), the absurdity, even the impossibility, of the statements forced by torture from women and children shows that the accused preferred death as a means of escape from the torture, and admitted everything that was asked of them. They even said that Jewish men menstruated, and that the latter therefore practiced the drinking of Christian blood as a remedy.

At Bösing (Bazin, today <a href="Pezinok">Pezinok</a>, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>), it was charged that a nine-year-old boy had been bled to death, suffering cruel torture; thirty Jews confessed to the crime and were publicly burned. The true facts of the case were disclosed later, when the child was found alive in Vienna. He had been taken there by the accuser, Count Wolf of Bazin, as a means of ridding himself of his Jewish creditors at Bazin.

In <a href="Rinn">Rinn</a>, near <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, a boy named <a href="Andreas%20Oxner">Andreas Oxner</a> (also known as Anderl von Rinn) was said to have been bought by Jewish merchants and cruelly murdered by them in a forest near the city, his blood being carefully collected in vessels. The accusation of drawing off the blood (without murder) was not made until the beginning of the 17th century, when the cult was founded. The older inscription in the church of Rinn, dating from 1575, is distorted by fabulous embellishments for example, that the money paid for the boy to his godfather turned into leaves, and that a lily blossomed upon his grave. The cult continued until officially prohibited in 1994, by the Bishop of Innsbruck.

On 17 January 1670 <a href="Raphael%20Levy">Raphael Levy</a>, a member of the Jewish community of <a href="Metz">Metz</a>, was executed on charges of the ritual murder of a peasant child who had gone missing in the woods outside the village of <a href="Glatigny%2C%20Moselle">Glatigny</a> on 25 September 1669, the eve of <a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a>.

One of the child-saints in the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> is the six-year-old boy <a href="Gavriil%20Belostoksky">Gavriil Belostoksky</a> from the village Zverki. According to the legend supported by the church, the boy was kidnapped from his home during the holiday of <a href="Passover">Passover</a> while his parents were away. Shutko, who was a Jew from <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a>, was accused of bringing the boy to Białystok, poking him with sharp objects and draining his blood for nine days, then bringing the body back to Zverki and dumping it at a local field. A cult developed, and the boy was canonized in 1820. His relics are still the object of pilgrimage. On <a href="All%20Saints%20Day">All Saints Day</a>, 27 July 1997, the Belorussian state TV showed a film alleging the story is true. The revival of the cult in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> was cited as a dangerous expression of antisemitism in international reports on human rights and religious freedoms which were passed to the <a href="UNHCR">UNHCR</a>.





The attitude of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> towards these accusations and the cults venerating children supposedly killed by Jews has varied over time. The <a href="Pope">Papacy</a> generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.

In 1911, the "<a href="Dictionnaire%20apolog%C3%A9tique%20de%20la%20foi%20catholique">Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi catholique</a>", an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations. This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians. Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> periodical "<a href="La%20Civilt%C3%A0%20Cattolica">La Civiltà Cattolica</a>") promoted the blood libel as truth.

Today, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour. For example, <a href="Simon%20of%20Trent">Simon of Trent</a> was deleted from the Calendar of Saints in 1965 and does not appear in the current (2000) edition of the <a href="Roman%20Martyrology">Roman Martyrology</a>.


In late 1553 or 1554, <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>, the reigning <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, issued a <a href="firman%20%28decree%29">firman</a> (royal decree) formally denouncing blood libels against the Jews.

In 1983, <a href="Mustafa%20Tlass">Mustafa Tlass</a> wrote and published "The Matzah of Zion", which is a treatment of the <a href="Damascus%20affair">Damascus affair</a> of 1840 that repeats the ancient "blood libel", that <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s use the blood of murdered non-Jews in religious rituals such as baking <a href="Matza">Matza</a> bread. In this book, he argues that the true religious beliefs of Jews are "black hatred against all humans and religions," and that no Arab country should ever sign a peace treaty with <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Tlass re-printed the book several times, and he stands by its conclusions. Following the book's publication, Tlass told "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>", that this accusation against Jews was valid and that his book is "an historical study ... based on documents from France, Vienna and the American University in Beirut."

In 2003, the Egyptian newspaper "<a href="Al-Ahram">Al-Ahram</a>" published a series of articles by <a href="Osama%20El-Baz">Osama El-Baz</a>, a senior advisor to then Egyptian President <a href="Hosni%20Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a>. Among other things, Osama El-Baz explained the origins of the blood libel against the Jews. He said that Arabs and Muslims have never been antisemitic, as a group, but accepted that a few Arab writers and media figures attack Jews "on the basis of the racist fallacies and myths that originated in Europe". He urged people not to succumb to "myths" such as the blood libel.

However, the blood libel was featured in a scene in the <a href="Syria">Syria</a>n <a href="Arab%20television%20drama%23Syria">TV series</a> "<a href="Ash-Shatat">Ash-Shatat</a>", shown in 2003, while in 2013 the Israeli website "<a href="Arutz%20Sheva">Arutz Sheva</a>" reported cases of <a href="Israeli%20Arab">Israeli Arab</a>s asking "where Jews find the Christian blood they need to bake matza".

Bagpuss

Bagpuss is a British <a href="children%27s%20television%20series">children's television series</a>, made by <a href="Peter%20Firmin">Peter Firmin</a> and <a href="Oliver%20Postgate">Oliver Postgate</a>. The series of 13 episodes was first broadcast from 12 February 1974 to 7 May 1974 through their company <a href="Smallfilms">Smallfilms</a>. The title character was "a saggy, old cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams". Although only 13 episodes were made, it remains fondly remembered, and was frequently repeated in the UK for 13 years. In 1999 "Bagpuss" topped a BBC poll for the UK's favourite children's TV programme.

Each programme began in the same way: through a series of <a href="sepia%20tone">sepia</a> photographs, the viewer is told of a little girl named Emily (played by Emily Firmin, the daughter of illustrator Firmin), who owned a shop. Emily found lost and broken things and displayed them in the window, so their owners could come and collect them; the shop did not sell anything. She would leave the object in front of her favourite stuffed toy, the large, saggy, pink and white striped cat named Bagpuss, originally intended by Firmin to be a retired Indian Army cat who entertained children in the hospital with his "visible" thoughts appearing in a "thinks bubble" above his head. When Postgate and Firmin were asked to develop this character for a BBC programme Postgate placed him in the shop with other characters and his "thinks bubble" became a way to illustrate the stories and mend or explore the objects that Emily had found. Emily then recited a verse:

When Emily had left, Bagpuss woke up. The programme shifted from sepia to colour <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> film, and various toys in the shop came to life: Gabriel the toad (who, unlike most Smallfilms characters, could move by a special device beneath his can without the use of stop motion animation) and a <a href="rag%20doll">rag doll</a> called Madeleine. The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor <a href="Yaffle">Yaffle</a> (based on the philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, whom Postgate had once met), while the mice carved on the side of the "mouse organ" (a small mechanical <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> that played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. <a href="Sandra%20Kerr">Sandra Kerr</a> and <a href="John%20Faulkner%20%28musician%29">John Faulkner</a> provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the <a href="folk%20song">folk song</a>s. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by <a href="Oliver%20Postgate">Postgate</a>, who also wrote the stories.

The toys discussed what the new object was; someone (usually Madeleine) would tell a story related to the object (shown in an animated thought bubble over Bagpuss's head), often with a song, accompanied by Gabriel on the <a href="banjo">banjo</a> (which often sounded a lot more like a guitar), and then the mice, singing in high-pitched squeaky harmony to the tune of "<a href="Sumer%20Is%20Icumen%20In">Sumer Is Icumen In</a>" as they worked, mended the broken object. The newly mended thing was then placed in the shop window, so that whoever had lost it would see it as they went past, and could come in and claim it. Then Bagpuss would start yawning again, and as he fell asleep the narrator would speak as the colour faded to sepia and they all became toys again.

The scene is set at the turn of the 20th century, with Emily Firmin playing the part of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> child Emily. The first antique village vignette is a cropped image of <a href="Horrabridge">Horrabridge</a> taken in 1898, though nothing is known of the other photo of the children with the pram. The shop window was at the Firmin family home in <a href="Blean">Blean</a>.

The episodes used to be on at 1:45pm on BBC1 and the titles of the episodes each refer in some way to the object Emily found.

The programmes were made using <a href="stop%20motion">stop-frame animation</a>. Bagpuss is an actual cloth cat, but was not intended to be such an electric pink. "It should have been a ginger marmalade cat but the company in <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> dyeing the material made a mistake and it turned out pink and cream. It was the best thing that ever happened," said Firmin.

Madeleine the rag doll was made by Firmin's wife, Joan, with an extra long dress to hold their children's nightdresses, but Postgate asked Joan to make a new version as one of the characters.

Gabriel the Toad was the only character in the series who could move freely without the use of stop-frame animation. Scenes featuring him playing the banjo and singing would have taken quite a bit of time if filmed with the stop-frame method, so Peter Firmin created a mechanism that helped him control Gabriel through a hole in his can.The character was based on a real toad that lived in the basement area of the flat that Peter and Joan Firmin rented in Twickenham beside the River Thames. Peter first made Gabriel (named after Walter Gabriel in <a href="List%20of%20The%20Archers%20characters">"The Archers"</a>, a long-running British radio soap opera) for his live ITV programme "The Musical Box". Oliver chose him as one of the characters in Bagpuss and Peter made a new, slightly larger version.

Professor Yaffle was created as the Bookend who had access to "facts". The BBC did not like Peter's first character, a man in top hat made from Black Irish bogwood called "Professor Bogwood". They thought it was too frightening and asked for a non-human instead.

Bagpuss has now retired to the <a href="Rupert%20Bear%20Museum">Rupert Bear Museum</a> in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, part of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Canterbury">Museum of Canterbury</a>, together with other characters and Emily's shop window.

Most of the stories and songs used in the series are based on folk songs and <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s from around the world.

Naive set theory

Naïve set theory is one of several theories of sets used in the discussion of the <a href="foundations%20of%20mathematics">foundations of mathematics</a>.

Unlike <a href="Set%20theory%23Axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theories</a>, which are defined using formal logic, naïve set theory is defined informally, in natural language. It describes the aspects of <a href="mathematical%20set">mathematical set</a>s familiar in <a href="discrete%20mathematics">discrete mathematics</a> (for example <a href="Venn%20diagram">Venn diagram</a>s and symbolic reasoning about their <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28logic%29">Boolean algebra</a>), and suffices for the everyday use of set theory concepts in contemporary mathematics.

Sets are of great importance in <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>; in modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects (<a href="number">number</a>s, <a href="relation%20%28mathematics%29">relations</a>, <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">functions</a>, etc.) are defined in terms of sets. Naïve set theory suffices for many purposes, while also serving as a stepping-stone towards more formal treatments. 

A naïve theory in the sense of "naïve set theory" is a non-formalized theory, that is, a theory that uses a <a href="natural%20language">natural language</a> to describe sets and operations on sets. The words and, or, if ... then, not, for some, for every are treated as in ordinary mathematics. As a matter of convenience, use of naïve set theory and its formalism prevails even in higher mathematics – including in more formal settings of set theory itself.

The first development of <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a> was a naïve set theory. It was created at the end of the 19th century by <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> as part of his study of <a href="infinite%20set">infinite set</a>s and developed by <a href="Gottlob%20Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> in his "<a href="Begriffsschrift">Begriffsschrift</a>".

Naïve set theory may refer to several very distinct notions. It may refer to

The assumption that any property may be used to form a set, without restriction, leads to <a href="paradox">paradox</a>es. One common example is <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">Russell's paradox</a>: there is no set consisting of "all sets that do not contain themselves". Thus consistent systems of naïve set theory must include some limitations on the principles which can be used to form sets.

Some believe that <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>'s set theory was not actually implicated in the set-theoretic paradoxes (see Frápolli 1991). One difficulty in determining this with certainty is that Cantor did not provide an axiomatization of his system. By 1899, Cantor was aware of some of the paradoxes following from unrestricted interpretation of his theory, for instance <a href="Cantor%27s%20paradox">Cantor's paradox</a> and the <a href="Burali-Forti%20paradox">Burali-Forti paradox</a>, and did not believe that they discredited his theory. Cantor's paradox can actually be derived from the above (false) assumption using for is a <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinal number</a>". Frege explicitly axiomatized a theory in which a formalized version of naïve set theory can be interpreted, and it is "this" formal theory which <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> actually addressed when he presented his paradox, not necessarily a theory Cantor, who, as mentioned, was aware of several paradoxes, presumably had in mind.

Axiomatic set theory was developed in response to these early attempts to understand sets, with the goal of determining precisely what operations were allowed and when.

A naïve set theory is not "necessarily" inconsistent, if it correctly specifies the sets allowed to be considered. This can be done by the means of definitions, which are implicit axioms. It is possible to state all the axioms explicitly, as in the case of Halmos' "Naïve Set Theory", which is actually an informal presentation of the usual axiomatic <a href="Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel%20set%20theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory</a>. It is "naïve" in that the language and notations are those of ordinary informal mathematics, and in that it doesn't deal with consistency or completeness of the axiom system.

Likewise, an axiomatic set theory is not necessarily consistent: not necessarily free of paradoxes. It follows from <a href="G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems">Gödel's incompleteness theorems</a> that a sufficiently complicated <a href="first%20order%20logic">first order logic</a> system (which includes most common axiomatic set theories) cannot be proved consistent from within the theory itself – even if it actually is consistent. However, the common axiomatic systems are generally believed to be consistent; by their axioms they do exclude "some" paradoxes, like <a href="Russell%27s%20paradox">Russell's paradox</a>. Based on <a href="G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorems">Gödel's theorem</a>, it is just not known – and never can be – if there are "no" paradoxes at all in these theories or in any first-order set theory.

The term "naïve set theory" is still today also used in some literature to refer to the set theories studied by Frege and Cantor, rather than to the informal counterparts of modern axiomatic set theory.

The choice between an axiomatic approach and other approaches is largely a matter of convenience. In everyday mathematics the best choice may be informal use of axiomatic set theory. References to particular axioms typically then occurs only when tradition demands it, e.g. the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a> is often mentioned when used. Likewise, formal proofs occur only when exceptional circumstances warrant it. This informal usage of axiomatic set theory can have (depending on notation) precisely the "appearance" of the naïve set theory outlined below, and is considerably easier, both to read and to write, including in the formulation of most statements and proofs and lines of discussion, and is probably less error-prone for most people than a strictly formal approach.

In naïve set theory, a set is described as a well-defined collection of objects. These objects are called the elements or members of the set. Objects can be anything: numbers, people, other sets, etc. For instance, 4 is a member of the set of all even <a href="integer">integer</a>s. Clearly, the set of even numbers is infinitely large; there is no requirement that a set be finite.
The definition of sets goes back to <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>. He wrote 1915 in his article "<a href="http%3A//gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/index.php%3Fid%3Dpdf%26amp%3Bno_cache%3D1%26amp%3BIDDOC%3D36218">Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre</a>":

“Unter einer 'Menge' verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung M von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten m unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die 'Elemente' von M genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen.” – Georg Cantor
“A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception or of our thought—which are called elements of the set.” – Georg Cantor

It does "not" follow from this definition "how" sets can be formed, and what operations on sets again will produce a set. The term "well-defined" in "well-defined collection of objects" cannot, by itself, guarantee the consistency and unambiguity of what exactly constitutes and what does not constitute a set. Attempting to achieve this would be the realm of axiomatic set theory or of axiomatic class theory.

The problem, in this context, with informally formulated set theories, not derived from (and implying) any particular axiomatic theory, is that there may be several widely differing formalized versions, that have both different sets and different rules for how new sets may be formed, that all conform to the original informal definition. For example, Cantor's verbatim definition allows for considerable freedom in what constitutes a set. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Cantor was particularly interested in sets containing cats and dogs, but rather only in sets containing purely mathematical objects. An example of such a class of sets could be the <a href="von%20Neumann%20universe">von Neumann universe</a>. But even when fixing the class of sets under consideration, it is not always clear which rules for set formation are allowed without introducing paradoxes.

For the purpose of fixing the discussion below, the term "well-defined" should instead be interpreted as an "intention", with either implicit or explicit rules (axioms or definitions), to rule out inconsistencies. The purpose is to keep the often deep and difficult issues of consistency away from the, usually simpler, context at hand. An explicit ruling out of "all" conceivable inconsistencies (paradoxes) cannot be achieved for an axiomatic set theory anyway, due to Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, so this does not at all hamper the utility of naïve set theory as compared to axiomatic set theory in the simple contexts considered below. It merely simplifies the discussion. Consistency is henceforth taken for granted unless explicitly mentioned.

If "x" is a member of a set "A", then it is also said that "x" belongs to "A", or that "x" is in "A". This is denoted by "x" ∈ "A". The symbol ∈ is a derivation from the lowercase Greek letter <a href="epsilon">epsilon</a>, "ε", introduced by <a href="Giuseppe%20Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a> in 1889 and shall be the first letter of the word <a href="https%3A//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%25E1%25BC%2590%25CF%2583%25CF%2584%25CE%25AF">ἐστί</a> (means "is"). The symbol ∉ is often used to write "x" ∉ "A", meaning "x is not in A".

Two sets "A" and "B" are defined to be <a href="Equality%20%28mathematics%29">equal</a> when they have precisely the same elements, that is, if every element of "A" is an element of "B" and every element of "B" is an element of "A". (See <a href="axiom%20of%20extensionality">axiom of extensionality</a>.) Thus a set is completely determined by its elements; the description is immaterial. For example, the set with elements 2, 3, and 5 is equal to the set of all <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s less than 6.
If the sets "A" and "B" are equal, this is denoted symbolically as "A" = "B" (as usual).

The <a href="empty%20set">empty set</a>, often denoted Ø and sometimes formula_1, is a set with no members at all. Because a set is determined completely by its elements, there can be only one empty set. (See <a href="axiom%20of%20empty%20set">axiom of empty set</a>.) Although the empty set has no members, it can be a member of other sets. Thus Ø ≠ {Ø}, because the former has no members and the latter has one member. It is interesting to note that, in mathematics, the only sets with which one needs to be concerned can be built up from the empty set alone ().

The simplest way to describe a set is to list its elements between curly braces (known as defining a set "extensionally"). Thus denotes the set whose only elements are and .
Note the following points:
(These are consequences of the definition of equality in the previous section.)

This notation can be informally abused by saying something like to indicate the set of all dogs, but this example would usually be read by mathematicians as "the set containing the single element "dogs"".

An extreme (but correct) example of this notation is , which denotes the empty set.

The notation , or sometimes {"x" | "P"("x")}, is used to denote the set containing all objects for which the condition holds (known as defining a set "intensionally").
For example, ∈ R} denotes the set of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, denotes the set of everything with blonde hair.

This notation is called <a href="set-builder%20notation">set-builder notation</a> (or "set comprehension", particularly in the context of <a href="Functional%20programming">Functional programming</a>).
Some variants of set builder notation are:

Given two sets "A" and "B", "A" is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of "B" if every element of "A" is also an element of "B".
In particular, each set "B" is a subset of itself; a subset of "B" that is not equal to "B" is called a proper subset.

If "A" is a subset of "B", then one can also say that "B" is a superset of "A", that "A" is contained in "B", or that "B" contains "A". In symbols, "A" ⊆ "B" means that "A" is a subset of "B", and "B" ⊇ "A" means that "B" is a superset of "A".
Some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ for subsets, and others use these symbols only for "proper" subsets. For clarity, one can explicitly use the symbols ⊊ and ⊋ to indicate non-equality.

As an illustration, let R be the set of real numbers, let Z be the set of integers, let "O" be the set of odd integers, and let "P" be the set of current or former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Presidents</a>.
Then "O" is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of R, and (hence) "O" is a subset of R, where in all cases "subset" may even be read as "proper subset".
Note that not all sets are comparable in this way. For example, it is not the case either that R is a subset of "P" nor that "P" is a subset of R.

It follows immediately from the definition of equality of sets above that, given two sets "A" and "B", "A" = "B" if and only if "A" ⊆ "B" and "B" ⊆ "A". In fact this is often given as the definition of equality. Usually when trying to <a href="mathematical%20proof">prove</a> that two sets are equal, one aims to show these two inclusions. Note that the <a href="empty%20set">empty set</a> is a subset of every set (the statement that all elements of the empty set are also members of any set "A" is <a href="vacuously%20true">vacuously true</a>).

The set of all subsets of a given set "A" is called the <a href="power%20set">power set</a> of "A" and is denoted by formula_2 or formula_3; the ""P"" is sometimes in a <a href="Script%20%28typefaces%29">script</a> font. If the set "A" has "n" elements, then formula_3 will have formula_5 elements.

In certain contexts, one may consider all sets under consideration as being subsets of some given <a href="universe%20%28mathematics%29">universal set</a>.
For instance, when investigating properties of the <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s R (and subsets of R), R may be taken as the universal set. A true universal set is not included in standard set theory (see <a href="%23Paradoxes">Paradoxes</a> below), but is included in some non-standard set theories.

Given a universal set U and a subset "A" of U, the <a href="complement%20%28set%20theory%29">complement</a> of "A" (in U) is defined as
In other words, "A" (""A-complement""; sometimes simply "A, ""A-prime"" ) is the set of all members of U"' which are not members of "A".
Thus with R, Z and "O" defined as in the section on subsets, if Z is the universal set, then "O" is the set of even integers, while if R is the universal set, then "O" is the set of all real numbers that are either even integers or not integers at all.

Given two sets "A" and "B", their <a href="union%20%28set%20theory%29">union</a> is the set consisting of all objects which are elements of "A" or of "B" or of both (see <a href="axiom%20of%20union">axiom of union</a>). It is denoted by "A" ∪ "B".

The <a href="intersection%20%28set%20theory%29">intersection</a> of "A" and "B" is the set of all objects which are both in "A" and in "B". It is denoted by "A" ∩ "B".

Finally, the <a href="complement%20%28set%20theory%29">relative complement</a> of "B" relative to "A", also known as the set theoretic difference of "A" and "B", is the set of all objects that belong to "A" but "not" to "B". It is written as "A" \ "B" or "A" − "B".

Symbolically, these are respectively

Notice that "A" doesn't have to be a subset of "B" for "B" \ "A" to make sense; this is the difference between the relative complement and the absolute complement ("A" = "U" \ "A") from the previous section.

To illustrate these ideas, let "A" be the set of left-handed people, and let "B" be the set of people with blond hair. Then "A" ∩ "B" is the set of all left-handed blond-haired people, while "A" ∪ "B" is the set of all people who are left-handed or blond-haired or both. "A" \ "B", on the other hand, is the set of all people that are left-handed but not blond-haired, while "B" \ "A" is the set of all people who have blond hair but aren't left-handed.

Now let "E" be the set of all human beings, and let "F" be the set of all living things over 1000 years old. What is "E" ∩ "F" in this case? No living human being is <a href="Oldest%20people">over 1000 years old</a>, so "E" ∩ "F" must be the <a href="empty%20set">empty set</a> {}.

For any set "A", the power set formula_3 is a <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28structure%29">Boolean algebra</a> under the operations of union and intersection.

Intuitively, an <a href="ordered%20pair">ordered pair</a> is simply a collection of two objects such that one can be distinguished as the "first element" and the other as the "second element", and having the fundamental property that, two ordered pairs are equal if and only if their "first elements" are equal and their "second elements" are equal.

Formally, an ordered pair with first coordinate "a", and second coordinate "b", usually denoted by ("a", "b"), can be defined as the set <nowiki></nowiki>.

It follows that, two ordered pairs ("a","b") and ("c","d") are equal if and only if "a" = "c" and "b" = "d".

Alternatively, an ordered pair can be formally thought of as a set {a,b} with a <a href="total%20order">total order</a>.

(The notation ("a", "b") is also used to denote an <a href="open%20interval">open interval</a> on the <a href="real%20number%20line">real number line</a>, but the context should make it clear which meaning is intended. Otherwise, the notation ]"a", "b"[ may be used to denote the open interval whereas ("a", "b") is used for the ordered pair).

If "A" and "B" are sets, then the <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a> (or simply product) is defined to be:
That is, "A" × "B" is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an element of "A" and whose second coordinate is an element of "B".

This definition may be extended to a set "A" × "B" × "C" of ordered triples, and more generally to sets of ordered <a href="n-tuple">n-tuple</a>s for any positive integer "n".
It is even possible to define infinite <a href="Cartesian%20product">Cartesian product</a>s, but this requires a more recondite definition of the product.

Cartesian products were first developed by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> in the context of <a href="analytic%20geometry">analytic geometry</a>. If R denotes the set of all <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, then R := R × R represents the <a href="Euclidean%20plane">Euclidean plane</a> and R := R × R × R represents three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a>.

There are some ubiquitous sets that for which the notation is almost universal. Some of these are listed below. In the list, "a", "b", and "c" refer <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s, and "r" and "s" are <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s.

The unrestricted formation principle of sets referred to as the <a href="Axiom%20schema%20of%20specification%23Unrestricted%20comprehension">axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension</a>,
is the source of several early appearing paradoxes:

If the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is weakened to the <a href="axiom%20schema%20of%20specification">axiom schema of specification</a> or axiom schema of separation,
then all the above paradoxes disappear. There is a corollary. With the axiom schema of separation as an axiom of the theory, it follows, as a theorem of the theory:
Or, more spectacularly (Halmos' phrasing): There is no <a href="Domain%20of%20discourse">universe</a>. "Proof": Suppose that it exists and call it . Now apply the axiom schema of separation with and for use . This leads to Russell's paradox again. Hence can't exist in this theory.

Related to the above constructions is formation of the set

It is (perhaps surprisingly) not the possibility of that is problematic. It is again the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension allowing for . With the axiom schema of specification instead of unrestricted comprehension, the conclusion doesn't hold and, hence is not a logical consequence.

Nonetheless, the possibility of is often removed explicitly or, e.g. in ZFC, implicitly, by demanding the <a href="axiom%20of%20regularity">axiom of regularity</a> to hold. One consequence of it is
or, in other words, no set is an element of itself.

The axiom schema of separation is simply too weak (while unrestricted comprehension is a very strong axiom—too strong for set theory) to develop set theory with its usual operations and constructions outlined above. The axiom of regularity is of a restrictive nature as well. Therefore, one is led to the formulation of other axioms to guarantee the existence of enough sets to form a set theory. Some of these have been described informally above and many others are possible. Not all conceivable axioms can be combined freely into consistent theories. For example, the <a href="axiom%20of%20choice">axiom of choice</a> of ZFC is incompatible with the conceivable every set of reals is <a href="Lebesgue%20measurable">Lebesgue measurable</a>. The former implies the latter is false.

Murmured voice

Murmur (also called breathy voice, whispery voice, soughing and susurration) is a <a href="phonation">phonation</a> in which the <a href="vocal%20folds">vocal folds</a> vibrate, as they do in normal (modal) voicing, but are adjusted to let more air escape which produces a sighing-like sound. A simple murmured phonation, (not actually a <a href="fricative%20consonant">fricative consonant</a>, as a literal reading of the IPA chart would suggest), can sometimes be heard as an <a href="allophone">allophone</a> of English between vowels, such as in the word "behind", for some speakers.

In the context of the <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan languages</a> like <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and comparative <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European studies</a>, murmured consonants are often called "voiced aspirated", as in the Hindi and Sanskrit stops normally denoted "bh, dh, ḍh, jh," and "gh" and the reconstructed <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> phoneme "gʷʰ". From an articulatory perspective, that terminology is incorrect, as murmur is a different type of phonation from <a href="aspirated%20consonant">aspiration</a>. However, murmured and aspirated stops are acoustically similar in that in both cases there is a delay in the onset of full voicing. In the history of several languages, like <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and some <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">varieties of Chinese</a>, murmured stops have developed into aspirated stops.

There is some confusion as to the nature of murmured phonation. The IPA and authors such as <a href="Peter%20Ladefoged">Peter Ladefoged</a> equate phonemically contrastive murmur with "breathy voice" in which the vocal folds are held with lower tension (and further apart) than in modal voice, with a concomitant increase in airflow and slower vibration of the glottis. In that model, murmur is a point in a continuum of glottal aperture between modal voice and breath phonation (voicelessness).

Others, such as Laver, Catford, Trask and the authors of the <a href="Voice%20Quality%20Symbols">Voice Quality Symbols</a> (VoQS), equate murmur with "whispery voice" in which the vocal folds or, at least, the anterior part of the vocal folds vibrates, as in modal voice, but the arytenoid cartilages are held apart to allow a large turbulent airflow between them. In that model, murmur is a compound phonation of approximately modal voice plus whisper.

It is possible that the realization of murmur varies among individuals or languages. The IPA uses the term "breathy voice", but VoQS uses the term "whispery voice". Both accept the term "murmur", popularised by Ladefoged.

A stop with murmured release or a murmured nasal is transcribed in the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> as either etc. or etc. Murmured vowels are most often written etc.

In VoQS, the notation } is used for whispery voice (or murmur), and } is used for breathy voice. Some authors, such as Laver, suggest the alternative transcription (rather than IPA ) as the correct analysis of <a href="Gujarati%20language">Gujarati</a> , but it could be confused with the replacement of modal voicing in voiced segments with <a href="whispering">whispered</a> phonation, conventionally transcribed with the diacritic .

There are several ways to produce murmured sounds such as . One is to hold the vocal cords apart, so that they are lax as they are for , but to increase the volume of airflow so that they vibrate loosely. A second is to bring the vocal cords closer together along their entire length than in voiceless , but not as close as in modally voiced sounds such as vowels. This results in an airflow intermediate between and vowels, and is the case with English intervocalic /h/. A third is to constrict the glottis, but separate the <a href="arytenoid%20cartilage">arytenoid cartilage</a>s that control one end. This results in the vocal cords being drawn together for voicing in the back, but separated to allow the passage of large volumes of air in the front. This is the situation with Hindi.

The distinction between the latter two of these realizations, vocal cords somewhat separated along their length ("breathy voice") and vocal cords together with the arytenoids making an opening ("whispery voice"), is phonetically relevant in <a href="Hmong%20language">White Hmong</a> ("Hmong Daw").

A number of languages use breathy voicing in a phonologically contrastive way. Many <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan languages</a>, such as <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, typically have a four-way contrast among plosives and affricates (voiced, murmured, <a href="tenuis%20consonant">tenuis</a>, aspirated) and a two-way contrast among nasals (voiced, murmured). The <a href="Nguni%20languages">Nguni languages</a> within the southern branch of the <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu languages</a>, including <a href="Phuthi%20language">Phuthi</a>, <a href="Xhosa%20language">Xhosa</a>, <a href="Zulu%20language">Zulu</a>, <a href="Southern%20Ndebele%20language">Southern Ndebele</a> and <a href="Swazi%20language">Swazi</a>, also have contrastive murmur. In the case of Xhosa, there is a four-way contrast analogous to Indic in oral <a href="click%20consonant">clicks</a>, and similarly a two-way contrast among nasal clicks, but a three-way contrast among plosives and affricates (murmured, aspirated, and <a href="ejective%20consonant">ejective</a>), and two-way contrasts among fricatives (voiceless and murmured) and nasals (voiced and murmured).

In some Bantu languages, historically murmured stops have been phonetically devoiced, but the four-way contrast in the system has been retained. In all five of the southeastern Bantu languages named, the murmured stops (even if they are realised phonetically as devoiced aspirates) have a marked tone-lowering (or tone-depressing) effect on the following <a href="tautosyllabic">tautosyllabic</a> vowels. For this reason, such stop consonants are frequently referred to in the local linguistic literature as 'depressor' stops.

Swazi, and to a greater extent Phuthi, display good evidence that breathy voicing can be used as a morphological property independent of any consonant voicing value. For example, in both languages, the standard morphological mechanism for achieving the <a href="Morphology%20%28linguistics%29%23Paradigms%20and%20morphosyntax">morphosyntactic</a> <a href="copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a> is to simply execute the noun prefix syllable as murmured (or 'depressed').

In <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, vowels after the <a href="stress%20%28linguistics%29%23Lexical%20stress">stressed syllable</a> can be pronounced with murmur.

Gujarati is unusual in contrasting murmured vowels and consonants: 'twelve', 'outside', 'burden'.

<a href="Ju%C7%80%27hoan%20dialect">Tsumkwe Juǀ'hoan</a> makes the following rare distinctions : fall, land (of a bird etc.); walk; herb species; and /n|ʱoaᵑ/ greedy person; /n|oaʱᵑ/ cat.

Murmured stops in <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a> lost their murmur, merging with voiceless and voiced stops in various positions, and a system of high and low <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tones</a> developed in syllables that formerly had these sounds.

Murmured voice can also be observed in place of <a href="debuccalization">debuccalized</a> coda /s/ in <a href="Spanish%20dialects%20and%20varieties">some dialects of colloquial Spanish</a>, e.g. [ˈt̪o̞ðo̞ʱ lo̞ʰ ˈθːiʱnːe̞ʰ ˈsõ̞ⁿ ˈblãŋko̞ʰ] for " ".

Bézout's identity

Bézout's identity (also called Bézout's lemma) is a theorem in elementary <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>: let "a" and "b" be nonzero <a href="integer">integer</a>s and let "d" be their <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a>. Then there exist integers "x" and "y" such that
In addition,

The integers "x" and "y" are called Bézout coefficients for ("a", "b"); they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">extended Euclidean algorithm</a>. If both "a" and "b" are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that formula_2 and formula_3
(equality may occur only if one of "a" and "b" is a multiple of the other).

Many other theorems in elementary number theory, such as <a href="Euclid%27s%20lemma">Euclid's lemma</a> or <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, result from Bézout's identity.

A <a href="B%C3%A9zout%20domain">Bézout domain</a> is an <a href="integral%20domain">integral domain</a> in which Bézout's identity holds. In particular, Bézout's identity holds in <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a>s. Every theorem that results from Bézout's identity is thus true in all these domains.

When one pair of Bézout coefficients ("x", "y") has been computed (e.g., using <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">extended Euclidean algorithm</a>), all pairs can be represented in the form
where is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.

Among these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy 
and equality may occur only if one of and divides the other.
This relies on a property of <a href="Euclidean%20division">Euclidean division</a>: given two integers "c" and "d", if "d" does not divide "c", there is exactly one pair such that and , and another one such that and . The two pairs of small Bézout's coefficients are obtained by choosing in the above formula for getting either remainder of the division of by formula_6

The Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.

Let "a" = 12 and "b" = 42, gcd (12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following Bézout's identities, with the Bézout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.

Given some integers formula_8 and formula_9 let formula_10 Since formula_11 is trivially nonempty, let 
formula_12 be the smallest positive integer in formula_13 Now consider some other formula_14 and assume by contradiction that formula_15 is not divisible by formula_16 Then according to <a href="Euclidean%20division">Euclidean division</a>, formula_17 such that:

formula_18

formula_19

But this implies that formula_20 and since formula_21 this violates the original premise that formula_22 is the smallest number in formula_23 thus formula_15 must be divisible by formula_22 for all formula_26. We now show that formula_27:

Consider the following specific examples for formula_26:
formula_29

Therefore, both formula_8 and formula_31 must be divisible by formula_16

Now consider a common divisor formula_33 of formula_8 and formula_31:
formula_36

So if formula_33 divides formula_8 and formula_9 then formula_33 also must divide formula_22

Therefore, by the definition of the <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a>, formula_42

Bézout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if 

then there are integers formula_44 such that

has the following properties:

Bézout's identity works for <a href="univariate%20polynomial">univariate polynomial</a>s over a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the <a href="Extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">Extended Euclidean algorithm</a>.

As the common <a href="root%20of%20a%20polynomial">root</a>s of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity and <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20algebra">fundamental theorem of algebra</a> imply the following result: 

The generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is <a href="Hilbert%27s%20Nullstellensatz">Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>.

As noted in the introduction, Bézout's identity works not only in the <a href="ring%20%28algebra%29">ring</a> of integers, but also in any other <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a> (PID).
That is, if "R" is a PID, and "a" and "b" are elements of "R", and "d" is a greatest common divisor of "a" and "b",
then there are elements "x" and "y" in "R" such that "ax" + "by" = "d". The reason: the <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> "Ra"+"Rb" is principal and indeed is equal to "Rd".

An integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a <a href="B%C3%A9zout%20domain">Bézout domain</a>.

<a href="French%20people">French</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="%C3%89tienne%20B%C3%A9zout">Étienne Bézout</a> (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials. However, this statement for integers can be found already in the work of another French mathematician, <a href="Claude%20Gaspard%20Bachet%20de%20M%C3%A9ziriac">Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac</a> (1581–1638).

<doc id="4948" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4948" title="Banacek">
Banacek

Banacek (pronounced "BAN-a-check") is an American detective <a href="Television%20programs">TV series</a> starring <a href="George%20Peppard">George Peppard</a> that aired on the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> network from 1972 to 1974. The series was part of the rotating "<a href="NBC%20Mystery%20Movie">NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie</a>" anthology. It alternated in its time slot with several other shows, but was the only one of them to last beyond its first season.

Peppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, <a href="Polish-American">Polish-American</a> freelance <a href="Private%20investigator">investigator</a> based in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see <a href="locked%20room%20mystery">locked room mystery</a>). He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property. One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent "<a href="Poland">Polish</a>" proverbs such as:

Part of the joke was that Ralph Manza as Banacek's <a href="chauffeur">chauffeur</a> Jay Drury, would often ask "What does it mean, Boss?" Banacek also had a running agreement with his chauffeur for a 10% share of Banacek's 10% if he solved the crime. Mr. Drury was never at a loss for a potential solution which Banacek would always manage to shoot down with his very next line. Another recurring gag was for other characters to mispronounce his name, often, particularly in the case of rivals, deliberately. The name "Banaczek" (as pronounced in the show) is actually quite rare in Poland.

Also featured were <a href="Murray%20Matheson">Murray Matheson</a> as rare-bookstore owner and information source Felix Mulholland and <a href="Christine%20Belford">Christine Belford</a> as Carlie Kirkland, Banacek's sometime-lover and always-rival. Felix was the series' only character to ever call Banacek by his first name.

Banacek's success as an investigator allowed him to live well. He had a mansion at 85 Mt. Vernon Street, (the same house used in "<a href="The%20Thomas%20Crown%20Affair%20%281968%20film%29">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>" starring <a href="Steve%20McQueen">Steve McQueen</a>) on Beacon Hill in Boston. He had a limousine and driver. He owned and drove an antique 1941 <a href="Packard">Packard</a> convertible. He had a <a href="mobile%20radio%20telephone">mobile radio telephone</a> in each of his cars at a time when these devices were uncommon and expensive. Banacek was intelligent, well-educated, cultured and suave. He was an unapologetic ladies man who enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but he was street-smart and could engage in violent hand-to-hand fighting if the moment called for it.

"<a href="The%20Thomas%20Crown%20Affair%20%281968%20film%29">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>" premise had been that a bored, wealthy Boston businessman (McQueen) masterminds a crime, leading to a match of wits with an insurance investigator (<a href="Faye%20Dunaway">Faye Dunaway</a>) who collects a 10 percent fee from the insurance company if she solves the case. "Banacek" borrowed elements of both characters and plot points.

In general the series was shot on the <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> backlot, though location scenes were filmed around Los Angeles in areas that could pass for Boston, or rural areas near there. The episode titled "If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?" was shot on location at the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20the%20Arts">California Institute of the Arts</a> around the time the school first opened. "Ten Thousand Dollars A Page" was filmed at the Pasadena Art Museum, later known as the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art and now the <a href="Norton%20Simon%20Museum%20of%20Art">Norton Simon Museum of Art</a>.

A customized 1969 <a href="American%20Motors">American Motors</a> AMX was built by <a href="George%20Barris%20%28auto%20customizer%29">George Barris</a> for the second regular season episode. The car became known as the <a href="AMC%20AMX%23AMX-400">AMX-400</a> and it is now owned by an automobile collector. Other continuing cars in the series were a 1941 <a href="Packard%20180">Packard 180</a> with a Victoria body designed by Howard "Dutch" Darrin (license plate number 178344), a 1973 Corvette (driven by Ms. Kirkland) and a 1973 <a href="Cadillac%20Fleetwood">Cadillac Fleetwood</a> <a href="limousine">limousine</a> (<a href="mobile%20telephone">mobile telephone</a> number KL 17811). In keeping with both the exotic car theme and the humor between Banacek and his driver Jay Drury, he was even chauffeured around in a <a href="Willys%20MB">Willys MB</a>, <a href="Jeep%20CJ">Jeep CJ</a>2A, and a CJ6, as well as a brand new Ford / <a href="De%20Tomaso%20Pantera">De Tomaso Pantera</a>.

In preparation for both the pilot, first, and then the second seasons the cast went to Boston and filmed a variety of background scenes. These scenes were then used through the series and are especially shown in the opening scenes including Banacek rowing on the <a href="Charles%20River">Charles River</a> and walking through <a href="Government%20Center%2C%20Boston">Government Center</a>. In the pilot, Banacek's car pulls into his Beacon Hill home, the historic <a href="Second%20Harrison%20Gray%20Otis%20House">Second Harrison Gray Otis House</a> located at 85 Mount Vernon Street. In other episodes, views are shown of the <a href="Public%20Garden%20%28Boston%29">Public Garden</a>, the entry to Felix's bookstore at 50 <a href="Beacon%20Street">Beacon Street</a>, and the <a href="Esplanade%2C%20Boston">Esplanade</a>. The Boston filmed pieces were done by a <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> and directed by Peppard himself.

Although the show had a mixture of humor and rather intricate plots, it never generated strong ratings. Despite this, the show was well received by critics. In addition, the <a href="Polish%20American%20Congress">Polish American Congress</a> gave the series an award for portraying Polish Americans in a good manner.

"Banacek" was well received by television critics, and as a result was picked up for a third season. However, before the third season could start, Peppard quit the show in order to prevent his ex-wife <a href="Elizabeth%20Ashley">Elizabeth Ashley</a> from receiving a larger percentage of his earnings as part of their divorce settlement. The complication ended any chance of reviving "Banacek" during Peppard's lifetime. <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20%28TV%20channel%29">A&E</a> continued rebroadcasts of "Banacek" in syndication.

Arts Alliance America has released the entire series on DVD in Region 1. Season 1 was released on May 15, 2007, without the series pilot. Season 2 was released on January 22, 2008 and included the pilot episode. On September 30, 2008, Arts Alliance released "Banacek: The Complete Series", a 5-disc boxset featuring all 16 episodes. As of 2012, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

In Region 2, Fabulous Films released both seasons on DVD in the UK on February 10, 2014.

In Region 4, <a href="Madman%20Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a> has released both seasons on DVD in Australia.

Banacek is currently airing on <a href="MeTV">MeTV</a> in most market areas.

Blue Angels

The Blue Angels is the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>'s flight demonstration squadron, with aviators from the Navy and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a>. The Blue Angels team was formed in 1946, making it the second oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French <a href="Patrouille%20de%20France">Patrouille de France</a> formed in 1931. 

The Blue Angels' six demonstration pilots currently fly the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a>, typically in more than 70 shows at 34 locations throughout the United States each year, where they still employ many of the same practices and techniques used in their aerial displays in their inaugural 1946 season. An estimated 11 million spectators view the squadron during air shows each full year. The Blue Angels also visit more than 50,000 people in a standard show season (March through November) in schools and hospitals. Since 1946, the Blue Angels have flown for more than 260 million spectators.

The mission of the United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron is "To showcase the pride and professionalism of the United States Navy and Marine Corps by inspiring a culture of excellence and service to country through flight demonstrations and community outreach."

The Blue Angels' show season runs each year from March until November. They perform at both military and civilian airfields, and often perform directly over major cities such as San Francisco's "<a href="Fleet%20Week">Fleet Week</a>" maritime festival, <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland's</a> annual Labor Day Air Show, the <a href="Chicago%20Air%20and%20Water%20Show">Chicago Air and Water Show</a>, <a href="Jacksonville">Jacksonville</a>'s Sea and Sky Spectacular, Milwaukee Air and Water Show, and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>'s annual <a href="Seafair">Seafair</a> festival.
During their <a href="aerobatics">aerobatic</a> demonstration, the Blues fly six F/A-18 Hornet aircraft, split into the <a href="diamond%20formation">Diamond Formation</a> (Blue Angels 1 through 4) and the Lead and Opposing "Solos" (Blue Angels 5 and 6). Most of the show alternates between <a href="Aerobatic%20maneuver">maneuver</a>s performed by the Diamond Formation and those performed by the Solos. The Diamond, in tight formation and usually at lower speeds (400 mph), performs maneuvers such as formation loops, rolls, and transitions from one formation to another. The Solos showcase the high performance capabilities of their individual aircraft through the execution of high-speed passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. The highest speed flown during an air show is 700 mph (just under Mach 1) and the lowest speed is 120 mph. Some of the maneuvers include both solo aircraft performing at once, such as opposing passes (toward each other in what appears to be a collision course) and mirror formations (back-to-back. belly-to-belly, or wingtip-to-wingtip, with one jet flying inverted). The Solos join the Diamond Formation near the end of the show for a number of maneuvers in the <a href="Delta%20Formation">Delta Formation</a>.

The parameters of each show must be tailored in accordance with local weather conditions at showtime: in clear weather the "high" show is performed; in overcast conditions a "low" show is performed, and in limited visibility (weather permitting) the "flat" show is presented. The "high" show requires at least an <a href="Ceiling%20%28cloud%29">ceiling</a> and visibility of at least from the show's centerpoint. The minimum ceilings allowed for low and flat shows are 3,500 feet (~1 km) and , respectively.

When initially formed, the unit was called the "Navy Flight Exhibition Team". The squadron was officially redesignated as the "United States Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron" in December 1974. The original team was christened the "Blue Angels" in 1946, when one of the pilots came across the name of New York City's Blue Angel Nightclub in "<a href="New%20Yorker%20Magazine">The New Yorker</a>" magazine; the team introduced themselves as the "Blue Angels" to the public for the first time on 21 July 1946, in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha</a>, Nebraska.

The official Blue Angels insignia was designed by then team leader Lt. Cmdr. R. E. "Dusty" Rhodes and Virginia Porter (Illustrator for Naval Air Advanced Training Command), then approved by <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> in 1949. It is nearly identical to the current design. In the cloud in the upper right quadrant, the aircraft were originally shown heading down and to the right. Over the years, the plane silhouettes have changed along with the squadron's aircraft. Additionally, the lower left quadrant, which contains the Chief of Naval Air Training insignia, has occasionally contained only <a href="Naval%20Aviator">Naval Aviator</a> wings.

Originally, demonstration aircraft were navy blue (nearly black) with gold lettering. The current shades of blue and yellow were adopted when the team transitioned to the Bearcat in 1946. For a single year, in 1949, the team performed in an all-yellow scheme with blue markings. 

The Blues' McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets are former fleet aircraft that are nearly combat-ready. Modifications to each aircraft include removal of the aircraft gun and replacement with the tank that contains smoke-oil used in demonstrations, and outfitting with the control stick spring system for more precise aircraft control input. The standard demonstration configuration has a spring tensioned with of force installed on the control stick as to allow the pilot minimal room for uncommanded movement. The Blues do not wear <a href="G-suit">G-suit</a>s, because the air bladders inside them would repeatedly deflate and inflate, interfering with the control stick between the pilot's legs. Instead, Blue Angel pilots tense their muscles to prevent blood from rushing from their heads and rendering them unconscious.

In July 2016, Boeing was awarded a $12 million contract to begin an engineering proposal for converting the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet for Blue Angels use, with the proposal to be completed by September 2017.

The show's narrator flies Blue Angel 7, a two-seat F/A-18D Hornet, to show sites. The Blues use this jet for backup, and to give demonstration rides to VIP civilians. Three backseats at each show are available; one of them goes to members of the press, the other two to "Key Influencers". The No. 4 slot pilot often flies the No. 7 aircraft in Friday's "practice" shows.

The Blue Angels use a <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130T Hercules</a>, nicknamed "Fat Albert", for their logistics, carrying spare parts, equipment, and to carry support personnel between shows. Beginning in 1975, "Bert" was used for <a href="JATO">Jet Assisted Take Off</a> (JATO) and short aerial demonstrations just prior to the main event at selected venues, but the JATO demonstration ended in 2009 due to dwindling supplies of rockets. "Fat Albert Airlines" flies with an all-Marine crew of three officers and five enlisted personnel. Following the death of Blue Angel 6 pilot Captain Jeff "Koosh" Kuss, USMC, Fat Albert had the honor of flying his remains back to NAS Pensacola, escorted by Kuss' wingman in Blue Angel 5, before then carrying him home to Colorado for burial with full military honors.

All team members, both officer and enlisted, pilots and staff officers, come from the ranks of regular Navy and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> units. The demonstration pilots and narrator are made up of Navy and USMC <a href="Naval%20Aviator">Naval Aviator</a>s. Pilots serve two to three years, and position assignments are made according to team needs, pilot experience levels, and career considerations for members.

The officer selection process requires pilots and support officers (flight surgeon, events coordinator, maintenance officer, supply officer, and public affairs officer) wishing to become Blue Angels to apply formally via their chain-of-command, with a personal statement, letters of recommendation, and flight records. Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18 demonstration pilots and naval flight officers are required to have a minimum of 1,250 tactical jet hours and be carrier-qualified. Marine Corps C-130 demonstration pilots are required to have 1,200 flight hours and be an aircraft commander.

Applicants "rush" the team at one or more airshows, paid out of their own finances, and sit in on team briefs, post-show activities, and social events. Rushes are asked to tell a joke prior to the brief and are graded by the team as part of the rigorous selection process. Team members vote in secret on the next year's members, with no accountability to the higher Navy authority why an applicant was or was not selected. Selections must be unanimous. There have been female and racial minority staff officers as official Blue Angel members. The most recent minority Blue Angel pilot was LCDR Keith Hoskins on the 2000 team. Flight surgeons serve a two-year term. They act as the team recorder during air shows and help oversee emergency response planning with the various air show planners. The first female Blue Angel flight surgeon was LT Tamara Schnurr, who was a member of the 2001 team.

The team leader (#1) is the Commanding Officer and is always a Navy Commander, who may be promoted to Captain mid-tour if approved for Captain by the selection board. Pilots of numbers 2–7 are Navy Lieutenants or Lieutenant Commanders, or Marine Corps Captains or Majors. The number 7 pilot narrates for a year, and then typically flies Opposing and then Lead Solo the following two years, respectively. The number 3 pilot moves to the number 4 (slot) position for his second year. Blue Angel No. 4 serves as the demonstration safety officer, due largely to the perspective he is afforded from the slot position within the formation, as well as his status as a second-year demonstration pilot. There are a number of other officers in the squadron, including a <a href="Naval%20Flight%20Officer">Naval Flight Officer</a>, the USMC C-130 pilots, a Maintenance Officer, an Administrative Officer, and a Flight Surgeon. Enlisted members range from E-4 to E-9 and perform all maintenance, administrative, and support functions. They serve three to four years in the squadron. After serving with the Blues, members return to fleet assignments.


Commander Ryan Bernacchi joined the Blue Angels in September 2015. He has accumulated more than 3,000 flight hours and 600 carrier-arrested landings, and is a graduate of the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN), NAS Fallon, Nevada. After graduating, he joined the TOPGUN staff as an instructor pilot and served as the Navy and Marine Corps subject matter expert in GPS guided weapons. Ryan served as a Federal Executive Fellow at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>. His decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, one Individual Air Medal with Combat "V" (three Strike Flight), four Navy Commendation Medals, one with Combat "V," and numerous unit, campaign, and service awards.

Annual winter training takes place at <a href="NAF%20El%20Centro">NAF El Centro</a>, California, where new and returning pilots hone skills learned in the fleet. During winter training, the pilots fly two practice sessions per day, six days a week, in order to fly the 120 training missions needed to perform the demonstration safely. Separation between the formation of aircraft and their maneuver altitude is gradually reduced over the course of about two months in January and February. The team then returns to their home base in <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, in March, and continues to practice throughout the show season. A typical week during the season has practices at NAS Pensacola on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. The team then flies to its show venue for the upcoming weekend on Thursday, conducting "circle and arrival" orientation maneuvers upon arrival. The team flies a "practice" airshow at the show site on Friday. This show is attended by invited guests but is often open to the general public. The main airshows are conducted on Saturdays and Sundays, with the team returning home to NAS Pensacola on Sunday evenings after the show. Monday is the Blues' day off.

On 24 April 1946 <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> issued a directive ordering the formation of a flight exhibition team to boost Navy morale, demonstrate naval air power, and maintain public interest in naval aviation. However, an underlying mission was to help the Navy generate public and political support for a larger allocation of the shrinking defense budget. In April of that year, Rear Admiral Ralph Davison personally selected <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> <a href="Roy%20Marlin%20Voris">Roy Marlin "Butch" Voris</a>, a World War II <a href="fighter%20ace">fighter ace</a>, to assemble and train a flight demonstration team, naming him Officer-in-Charge and Flight Leader. Voris selected three fellow instructors to join him (Lt. Maurice "Wick" Wickendoll, Lt. Mel Cassidy, and Lt. Cmdr. Lloyd Barnard, veterans of the War in the Pacific), and they spent countless hours developing the show. The group perfected its initial maneuvers in secret over the Florida <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> so that, in Voris' words, "if anything happened, just the alligators would know". The team's first demonstration before Navy officials took place on 10 May 1946 and was met with enthusiastic approval.
On 15 June Voris led a trio of <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats</a>, specially modified to reduce weight and painted sea blue with gold leaf trim, through their inaugural 15-minute-long performance at their Florida home base, <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Jacksonville">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a>. The team employed a <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">North American SNJ Texan</a>, painted and configured to simulate a <a href="Japanese%20Zero">Japanese Zero</a>, to simulate aerial combat. This aircraft was later painted yellow and dubbed the "Beetle Bomb". This aircraft is said to have been inspired by one of the <a href="Spike%20Jones%23Murdering%20the%20Classics">Spike Jones</a>' "Murdering the Classics" series of musical satires, set to the tune (in part) of the <a href="William%20Tell%20Overture">William Tell Overture</a> as a thoroughbred horse race scene, with "Beetle Bomb" being the "trailing horse" in the lyrics.

The team thrilled spectators with low-flying maneuvers performed in tight formations, and (according to Voris) by "keeping something in front of the crowds at all times. My objective was to beat the Army Air Corps. If we did that, we'd get all the other side issues. I felt that if we weren't the best, it would be my naval career." The Blue Angels' first public demonstration also netted the team its first trophy, which sits on display at the team's current home at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">NAS Pensacola</a>.
On 25 August 1946 the squadron upgraded their aircraft to the <a href="Grumman%20F8F%20Bearcat">Grumman F8F-1 Bearcat</a>. In May 1947, flight leader Lt. Cmdr. Bob Clarke replaced Butch Voris as the leader of the team and introduced the famous Diamond Formation, now considered the Blue Angels' trademark.

In 1949, the team acquired a <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas R4D Skytrain</a> for logistics to and from show sites. The team's SNJ was also replaced by a F8F-1 "Bearcat", painted yellow for the air combat routine, inheriting the "Beetle Bomb" nickname. The Blues transitioned to the straight-wing Grumman <a href="Grumman%20F9F%20Panther">Grumman F9F-2 Panther</a> on 13 July 1949, wherein the F8F-1 "Beetle Bomb" was relegated to solo aerobatics before the main show, until it crashed on takeoff at a training show in Pensacola in 1950.

Team headquarters shifted from <a href="NAS%20Corpus%20Christi">NAS Corpus Christi</a>, Texas, to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Whiting%20Field">NAAS Whiting Field</a>, Florida, in the fall of 1949, announced 14 July 1949.

The "Blues" continued to perform nationwide until the start of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> in 1950, when (due to a shortage of pilots, and no planes were available) the team was disbanded and its members were ordered to combat duty. Once aboard the aircraft carrier the group formed the core of <a href="VF-191">VF-191, Satan's Kittens</a>.

The Blue Angels were officially recommissioned on 25 October 1951, and reported to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Corpus%20Christi">NAS Corpus Christi</a>, Texas. Lt. Cdr. Voris was again tasked with assembling the team (he was the first of only two commanding officers to lead them twice). In 1953 the team traded its Sky Train for a <a href="Curtiss%20C-46%20Commando">Curtiss R5C Commando</a>.

In August 1953, "Blues" leader <a href="Arthur%20Ray%20Hawkins">LCDR Ray Hawkins</a> became the first naval aviator to survive an ejection at supersonic speeds when his F9F-6 became uncontrollable on a cross-country flight.

The first <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> pilot, Capt Chuck Hiett, joined the team and they relocated to their current home of <a href="NAS%20Pensacola">NAS Pensacola</a> in the winter of 1954. It was here they progressed to the swept-wing <a href="Grumman%20F-9%20Cougar">Grumman F9F-8 Cougar</a>.

In September 1956, the team added a sixth aircraft to the flight demonstration in the Opposing Solo position, and gave its first performance outside the United States at the International Air Exposition in <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. It also upgraded its logistics aircraft to the <a href="Douglas%20C-54%20Skymaster">Douglas R5D Skymaster</a>.

In January 1957, the team left its winter training facility at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Facility%20El%20Centro">Naval Air Facility El Centro</a>, California for a ten-year period. For the next ten years, the team would winter at <a href="NAS%20Key%20West">NAS Key West</a>, Florida. For the 1957 show season, the Blue Angels transitioned to the supersonic <a href="Grumman%20F11F%20Tiger">Grumman F11F-1 Tiger</a>, first flying the short-nosed, and then the long-nosed versions. The first Six-Plane Delta Maneuvers were added in the 1958 season.

In July 1964, the Blue Angels participated in the Aeronaves de Mexico Anniversary Air Show over <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, Mexico, before an estimated crowd of 1.5 million people.

In 1965, the Blue Angels conducted a <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> island tour, flying at five sites. Later that year, they embarked on a European tour to a dozen sites, including the <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a>, where they were the only team to receive a standing ovation.

The "Blues" toured Europe again in 1967 touring six sites. In 1968 the C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft was replaced with a <a href="Lockheed%20C-121%20Constellation">Lockheed VC-121J Constellation</a>. The "Blues" transitioned to the two-seat <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4J Phantom II</a> in 1969, nearly always keeping the back seat empty for flight demonstrations. The "Phantom" was the only plane to be flown by both the "Blues" and the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds">United States Air Force Thunderbirds</a>. That year they also upgraded to the <a href="Lockheed%20L-1049%20Super%20Constellation">Lockheed C-121 Super Constellation</a> for logistics.

The "Blues" received their first U.S. Marine Corps <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed KC-130F Hercules</a> in 1970. An all-Marine crew manned it. That year, they went on their first South American tour. In 1971, the team conducted its first Far East Tour, performing at a dozen locations in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1972, the Blue Angels were awarded the Navy's <a href="Meritorious%20Unit%20Commendation">Meritorious Unit Commendation</a> for the two-year period from 1 March 1970 – 31 December 1971. Another European tour followed in 1973, including air shows in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, Iran, England, France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Italy.
In December 1974 the Navy Flight Demonstration Team downsized to the subsonic <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">Douglas A-4F Skyhawk II</a> and was reorganized into the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron. This reorganization permitted the establishment of a commanding officer (the flight leader), added support officers, and further redefined the squadron's mission emphasizing the support of recruiting efforts. Commander Tony Less was the squadron's first official commanding officer.

On 8 November 1986 the Blue Angels completed their 40th anniversary year during ceremonies unveiling their present aircraft, the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a>, the first multi-role fighter/attack aircraft. The power and aerodynamics of the Hornet allows them to perform a slow, high <a href="angle%20of%20attack">angle of attack</a> "tail sitting" maneuver, and to fly a "dirty" (landing gear down) formation loop, the last of which is not duplicated by the USAF Thunderbirds.

Also in 1986, LCDR <a href="Donnie%20Cochran">Donnie Cochran</a>, joined the Blue Angels as the first <a href="Black%20people">African-American</a> Naval Aviator to be selected. He would return to lead the team in 1993.

In 1992 the Blue Angels deployed for a month-long European tour, their first in 19 years, conducting shows in Sweden, Finland, Russia (first foreign flight demonstration team to perform there), Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Spain.

In 1998, CDR Patrick Driscoll made the first "Blue Jet" landing on a "<a href="haze%20gray%20and%20underway">haze gray and underway</a>" aircraft carrier, <a href="USS%20Harry%20S.%20Truman">USS "Harry S. Truman"</a> (CVN-75).

In 2006, the Blue Angels marked their 60th year of performing. On 30 October 2008 a spokesman for the team announced that the team would complete its last three performances of the year with five jets instead of six. The change was because one pilot and another officer in the organization had been removed from duty for engaging in an "inappropriate relationship". The Navy stated that one of the individuals was a man and the other a woman, one a Marine and the other from the Navy, and that Rear Admiral Mark Guadagnini, chief of Naval air training, was reviewing the situation. At the next performance at <a href="Lackland%20Air%20Force%20Base">Lackland Air Force Base</a> following the announcement the No. 4 or slot pilot, was absent from the formation. A spokesman for the team would not confirm the identity of the pilot removed from the team. On 6 November 2008 both officers were found guilty at an <a href="Nonjudicial%20punishment">admiral's mast</a> on unspecified charges but the resulting punishment was not disclosed. The names of the two members involved were later released on the Pensacola News Journal website/forum as pilot No. 4 USMC Maj. Clint Harris and the administrative officer, Navy Lt. Gretchen Doane.

The Fat Albert performed its final JATO demonstration at the 2009 Pensacola Homecoming show, expending their 8 remaining JATO bottles. This demonstration not only was the last JATO performance of the squadron, but also the final JATO use of the U.S. Marine Corps.

In 2009, the Blue Angels were inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Air%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Museum">San Diego Air & Space Museum</a>.

On 22 May 2011, the Blue Angels were performing at the Lynchburg Regional Airshow in <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg</a>, Virginia, when the Diamond formation flew the Barrel Roll Break maneuver at an altitude that was lower than the required minimum altitude. The maneuver was aborted, the remainder of the demonstration canceled and all aircraft landed safely. The next day, the Blue Angels announced that they were initiating a safety stand-down, canceling their upcoming Naval Academy Airshow and returning to their home base in Pensacola, Florida, for additional training and airshow practice. On 26 May, the Blue Angels announced they would not be flying their traditional fly-over of the Naval Academy Graduation Ceremony and that they were canceling their 28–29 May 2011 performances at the Millville Wings and Wheels Airshow in <a href="Millville%2C%20New%20Jersey">Millville</a>, New Jersey.

On 27 May 2011, the Blue Angels announced that Commander Dave Koss, the squadron's Commanding Officer, would be stepping down. He was replaced by Captain Greg McWherter, the team's previous Commanding Officer. The squadron canceled performances at the <a href="Rockford%2C%20Illinois">Rockford</a>, Illinois Airfest 4–5 June and the <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville</a>, Indiana Freedom Festival Air Show 11–12 June to allow additional practice and demonstration training under McWherter's leadership.

Between 2 and 4 September 2011 on <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> weekend, the Blue Angels flew for the first time with a 50–50 blend of conventional JP-5 jet fuel and a <a href="camelina">camelina</a>-based biofuel at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Patuxent%20River">Naval Air Station Patuxent River</a> airshow at <a href="Patuxent%20River">Patuxent River</a>, Maryland. McWherter flew an F/A-18 test flight on 17 August and stated there were no noticeable differences in performance from inside the cockpit.

On 1 March 2013, the U.S. Navy announced that it was cancelling remaining 2013 performances after 1 April 2013 due to <a href="Sequester%20%282013%29">sequestration</a> budget constraints. In October 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, stating that "community and public outreach is a crucial Departmental activity", announced that the Blue Angels (along with the U.S. Air Force's <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Thunderbirds">Thunderbirds</a>) would resume appearing at air shows starting in 2014, although the number of flyovers will continue to be severely reduced.

In June 2014, Captain Greg McWherter, flight leader of the Blue Angels for 2008-2010 and 2011-2012, received letter of reprimand from Adm. <a href="Harry%20B.%20Harris%20Jr.">Harry Harris</a> after an <a href="Mast%20%28naval%29">admiral's mast</a> for “failing to stop obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment, condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers" during his second tour with the team.

In July 2014, Marine Corps Capt. Katie Higgins, 27, became the first female pilot to join the Blue Angels.

The "Blues" have flown eight different demonstration aircraft and five support aircraft models:




The following is the show routine used in 2017


During its history, 27 Blue Angels pilots have been killed in air show or training accidents. Through the 2006 season there have been 262 pilots in the squadron's history, giving the job a 10% fatality rate.





In November 2011, the Blue Angels received $37 million annually, out of the annual DoD budget.

Born again

In some Christian movements, particularly in <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelicalism</a>, to be born again is a popular phrase referring to "spiritual rebirth", or a <a href="Regeneration%20%28theology%29">regeneration</a> of the human spirit from the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20in%20Christianity">Holy Spirit</a>, contrasted with physical birth.

In contemporary Christian usage, the term is distinct from sometimes similar terms used in mainstream <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> to refer to being or becoming Christian, which is linked to <a href="baptism">baptism</a>. Individuals who profess to be "born again" often state that they have a personal relationship with <a href="Jesus%20in%20Christianity">Jesus Christ</a>. The phrase "born again" is also used as an adjective to describe individual members of the movement who espouse this belief, as well as the movement itself ("born-again Christian" and the "born-again movement").

The term is derived from an event in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> in which the words of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> were not understood by a Jewish pharisee, <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>.

The Greek phrase in the text is ambiguous, resulting in a <a href="wordplay">wordplay</a> in which "born again" is rendered as "born from above" in some translations such as the <a href="New%20English%20Translation">NET</a> and the <a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version">NRSV</a>.

The <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> uses the phrase "born again" three times, two of them in chapter 3 of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> when Jesus is speaking to <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>.

John's Gospel was written in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Greek</a>, and the word translated as "again" is ἄνωθεν ("ánōtʰen"), which could mean "again", or "from above". The <a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version">New Revised Standard Version</a> prefers this latter translation, and both the King James Version and the <a href="Revised%20Version">Revised Version</a> give it as an alternative in the margins. Hoskyns argues that it is to be preferred as the fundamental meaning and he drew attention to phrases such as "birth of the Spirit ()", "birth from God (cf. ; , , , )" but maintains that this necessarily carries with it an emphasis upon the newness of the life as given by God himself.

The final use of the phrase occurs in the <a href="First%20Epistle%20of%20Peter">First Epistle of Peter</a>, rendered in the King James Version as:
Here, the Greek word translated as "born again" is ().

The traditional Jewish understanding of the promise of salvation is interpreted as being rooted in "the seed of Abraham"; that is, physical lineage from Abraham. Jesus explained to Nicodemus that this doctrine was in error—that every person must have two births—natural birth of the physical body and another of the water and the spirit. This discourse with Nicodemus established the Christian belief that all human beings—whether Jew or Gentile—must be "born again" of the spiritual seed of Christ. The <a href="Apostle%20Peter">Apostle Peter</a> further reinforced this understanding in . The "Catholic Encyclopedia" states that "[a] controversy existed in the primitive church over the interpretation of the expression "the <a href="seed%20of%20Abraham">seed of Abraham</a>". It is [the Apostle Paul's] teaching in one instance that all who are Christ's by faith are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise. He is concerned, however, with the fact that the promise is not being fulfilled to the seed of Abraham (referring to the Jews)."

<a href="Charles%20Hodge">Charles Hodge</a> writes that "The subjective change wrought in the soul by the grace of God, is variously designated in Scripture" with terms such as "new birth", "resurrection", "new life", "new creation", "renewing of the mind", "dying to sin and living to righteousness", and "translation from darkness to light".

Jesus used the "birth" analogy in tracing spiritual newness of life to a divine beginning. Contemporary Christian theologians have provided explanations for "born from above" being a more accurate translation of the original Greek word transliterated "anōthen." <a href="Frank%20Stagg%20%28theologian%29">Theologian Frank Stagg</a> cites two reasons why the newer translation is significant:

An early example of the term in its more modern use appears in the sermons of <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>. In the sermon entitled "A New Birth" he writes, "none can be holy unless he be born again", and "except he be born again, none can be happy even in this world. For ... a man should not be happy who is not holy." Also, "I say, [a man] may be born again and so become an heir of salvation." Wesley also states infants who are baptized are born again, but for adults it is different:
The quotation from the Gospel of John has raised some questions about the meaning and authenticity of the phrase "born again". In the chapter, <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> is puzzled and asks Jesus what he means by saying that "Ye must be born again". He questions: "How can a man re-enter his mother's womb?" Scholar <a href="Bart%20D.%20Ehrman">Bart D. Ehrman</a> says that this confusion is because in Greek (the language of the gospel) the word "again" is ambiguous. It might mean "again" or "a second time" or "from above", which would explain Nicodemus' confusion. However, the Jews at Jesus' time were actually speaking Aramaic, in which there would not have been a double meaning. Ehrman says that this raises questions about the authenticity of the dialogue, the meaning of the words, and, therefore, the use of the phrase.

A 19th-century source notes that the phrase was not mentioned by the other Evangelists, nor by the Apostles except Peter. "It was not regarded by any of the Evangelists but John of sufficient importance to record." It adds that without John, "we should hardly have known that it was necessary for one to be born again." This suggests that "the text and context was meant to apply to Nicodemus particularly, and not to the world."

"The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics" notes: "The <a href="General%20Social%20Survey">GSS</a> ... has asked a born-again question on three occasions ... 'Would you say you have been 'born again' or have had a 'born-again' experience?" The Handbook says that "Evangelical, black, and Latino Protestants tend to respond similarly, with about two-thirds of each group answering in the affirmative. In contrast, only about one third of mainline Protestants and one sixth of Catholics (Anglo and Latino) claim a born-again experience." However, the handbook suggests that "born-again questions are poor measures even for capturing evangelical respondents. ... it is likely that people who report a born-again experience also claim it as an identity."

Use of the term "born again" in Catholicism to refer to Christian conversion is modern, presumably developing out of the teachings of <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> and popularized in the ministry of 19th century tent meeting revivalists such as <a href="Billy%20Sunday">Billy Sunday</a>, and <a href="Dwight%20L.%20Moody">Dwight L. Moody</a>. Individuals were encouraged to change their lives and 'come to Jesus'. Even with these early revivalists, the use of the term "born again" to describe this experience of conversion was still not widespread.

Historically, the classic text from <a href="John%203">John 3</a> was consistently interpreted by the early church fathers as a reference to baptism. Modern Catholic interpreters have noted that the phrase 'born from above' or 'born again' (John 3:3) is clarified as 'being born of water and Spirit' (John 3:5).

Catholic commentator John F. McHugh notes, "Rebirth, and the commencement of this new life, are said to come about ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ πνεύματος, of water and spirit. This phrase (without the article), refers to a rebirth which the early Church regarded as taking place through baptism (1 Pet 1.3, 23; Tit 3.5)."

The "<a href="Catechism%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catechism of the Catholic Church</a>" notes that the essential elements of Christian initiation are: "proclamation of the Word, acceptance of the Gospel entailing conversion, profession of faith, Baptism itself, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and admission to Eucharistic communion" (CCC 1229). Baptism gives the person the grace of forgiveness for all prior sins; it makes the newly baptized person a new creature and an adopted son of God (2 Corinthians 5:17; 2 Peter 1:4); it incorporates them into the Body of Christ (Ephesians 4:25) and creates a sacramental bond of unity leaving an indelible mark on our souls (CCC 1262-1274). "Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ. Baptism seals the Christian with the indelible spiritual mark (character) of his belonging to Christ. No sin can erase this mark, even if sin prevents Baptism from bearing the fruits of salvation. Given once for all, Baptism cannot be repeated" (CCC 1272). The Holy Spirit is involved with each aspect of the movement of grace. "The first work of the grace of the Holy Spirit is conversion. ... Moved by grace, man turns toward God and away from sin, thus accepting forgiveness and righteousness from on high" (CCC 1989).

The Catholic Church also teaches that under special circumstances the need for water baptism can be superseded by the Holy Spirit in a 'baptism of desire', such as when <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a>s die or are martyred prior to receiving baptism (CCC 1260).

<a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> wrote about "the problem of children baptized in infancy [who] come for catechesis in the parish without receiving any other initiation into the faith and still without any explicit personal attachment to Jesus Christ" ("Catechesi Tradendae" 19). He noted that "being a Christian means saying 'yes' to Jesus Christ, but let us remember that this 'yes' has two levels: It consists of surrendering to the word of God and relying on it, but it also means, at a later stage, endeavoring to know better—and better the profound meaning of this word" (CT 20).

The modern expression being "born again" is really about the concept of "conversion".
The National Directory of Catechesis (published by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, USCCB) defines conversion as, "the acceptance of a personal relationship with Christ, a sincere adherence to him, and a willingness to conform one's life to his." To put it more simply "Conversion to Christ involves making a genuine commitment to him and a personal decision to follow him as his disciple."
Echoing the writings of Pope John Paul II, the "National Directory of Catechesis" describes a new intervention required by our modern world called the "New Evangelization". The New Evangelization is directed to the Church herself, to the baptized who were never effectively evangelized before, to those who have never made a personal commitment to Christ and the Gospel, to those formed by the values of the secular culture, to those who have lost a sense of faith, and to those who are alienated

Declan O'Sullivan, co-founder of the Catholic Men's Fellowship and knight of the <a href="Sovereign%20Military%20Order%20of%20Malta">Sovereign Military Order of Malta</a>, wrote that the "New Evangelization emphasizes the personal encounter with Jesus Christ as a pre-condition for spreading the gospel. The born-again experience is not just an emotional, mystical high; the really important matter is what happened in the convert's life after the moment or period of radical change."

<a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> holds that "we are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost. But she also teaches that whoever is baptized must, though daily contrition and repentance, drown The Old Adam so that daily a new man come forth and arise who walks before God in righteousness and purity forever. She teaches that whoever lives in sins after his baptism has again lost the grace of baptism."

The phrase "born again" is mentioned in the <a href="39%20Articles">39 Articles</a> of the <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a> in article XV, entitled "Of Christ alone without Sin". In part, it reads: "sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."

Although the phrase "baptized and born again in Christ" occurs in Article XV, the reference is clearly to the scripture passage in John 3:3.. Surely it is anachronistic to read back into this the modern understanding? The phrase consistently referred to baptism in the early Church.

According to the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Reformed churches</a> being born again refers to "the inward working of the Spirit which induces the sinner to respond to the effectual call". According to the Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q 88, "the outward and ordinary means whereby Christ communicateth to us the benefits of redemption are, his ordinances, especially the word, sacraments, and prayer; all of which are made effectual to the elect for salvation." Effectual calling is "the work of God's Spirit, whereby, convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing our wills, he doth persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us in the gospel."":

In Reformed theology, "regeneration precedes faith." Samuel Storms writes that, "Calvinists insist that the sole cause of regeneration or being born again is the will of God. God first sovereignly and efficaciously regenerates, and only in consequence of that do we act. Therefore, the individual is passive in regeneration, neither preparing himself nor making himself receptive to what God will do. Regeneration is a change wrought in us by God, not an autonomous act performed by us for ourselves."

In <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>, the "new birth is necessary for salvation because it marks the move toward holiness. That comes with faith." <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, founder of the Methodist Church, held that the New Birth "is that great change which God works in the soul when he brings it into life, when he raises it from the death of sin to the life of righteousness" ("Works", vol. 2, pp. 193–194). The "<a href="Articles%20of%20Religion%20%28Methodist%29">Articles of Religion</a>", in Article XVII—Of Baptism, state that <a href="baptism">baptism</a> is a "sign of regeneration or the new birth." "The Methodist Visitor" in describing this doctrine, admonishes individuals: "'Ye must be born again.' Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.'"

Belief in the New Birth is an essential and distinctive element of <a href="evangelicalism">Evangelical Christianity</a>. For Evangelical Christians, the new birth always occurs before <a href="Believer%27s%20baptism">baptism</a>. For some churches, it is synonymous with the <a href="Baptism%20with%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">Baptism with the Holy Spirit</a>; however, it is considered a distinct experience in <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostalism</a>, the <a href="Charismatic%20Movement">Charismatic Movement</a>, and the <a href="Neo-charismatic%20movement">Neo-charismatic movement</a>.

"Although many evangelicals allow that conversion can be a process, generally they see it as a specific, identifiable moment of time when a person simply and sincerely trusts in Jesus Christ as savior." They understand to indicate a requirement of salvation: "That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." So, "to be born again" means "to be saved" because to be saved, one must confess Jesus is Lord with one's mouth and believe it in one's heart. Also, to be born again means to follow that "with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved".

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> believe that individuals do not have the power to be born again, but that God calls and selects his followers "from above". Only those belonging to the "<a href="144000%20%28number%29%23Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">144,000</a>" are considered to be born again.

The term "born again" is used by several Christian denominations, but there are disagreements on what the term means, and whether members of other denominations are justified in claiming to be born-again Christians.

A Catholic website says:

On the other hand, an Evangelical site argues:

The Reformed view of regeneration may be set apart from other outlooks in at least two ways. 

Historically, Christianity has used various <a href="metaphors">metaphors</a> to describe its <a href="rite">rite</a> of initiation, that is, <a href="baptismal%20regeneration">spiritual regeneration</a> via the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> of <a href="baptism">baptism</a> by the power of the water and the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">spirit</a>. This remains the common understanding in most of <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a>, held, for example, in <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>, <a href="Oriental%20Orthodoxy">Oriental Orthodoxy</a>, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>, and in much of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>. However, sometime after the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, <a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelicalism</a> attributed greater significance to the expression "born again" as an experience of <a href="religious%20conversion">religious conversion</a> (), symbolized by deep-water baptism, and rooted in a commitment to one's own personal faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. This same belief is, historically, also an integral part of <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> doctrine, and is connected with the doctrine of <a href="Justification%20%28theology%29">Justification</a>.

According to "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>":
According to <a href="J.%20Gordon%20Melton">J. Gordon Melton</a>:
According to <a href="Andrew%20Purves">Andrew Purves</a> and Charles Partee:
The term "born again" has become widely associated with the <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> Christian renewal since the late 1960s, first in the United States and then around the world. Associated perhaps initially with <a href="Jesus%20movement">Jesus People</a> and the Christian counterculture, "born again" came to refer to a conversion experience, accepting Jesus Christ as lord and savior in order to be saved from hell and given eternal life with God in heaven, and was increasingly used as a term to identify devout believers. By the mid-1970s, "born again" Christians were increasingly referred to in the mainstream media as part of the born again movement.

In 1976, <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate</a> conspirator <a href="Chuck%20Colson">Chuck Colson</a>'s book "Born Again" gained international notice. <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time" magazine</a> named him "One of the 25 most influential Evangelicals in America." The term was sufficiently prevalent so that during the year's presidential campaign, <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic party</a> nominee <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> described himself as "born again" in the first "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine interview of an American presidential candidate.

Colson describes his path to faith in conjunction with his criminal imprisonment and played a significant role in solidifying the "born again" identity as a <a href="cultural%20construct">cultural construct</a> in the US. He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a "personal encounter with God." He recalls:
<a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> was the first President of the United States to publicly declare that he was born-again, in 1976. By the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201980">1980 campaign</a>, all three major candidates stated that they had been born again.

Sider and Knippers state that "<a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s election that fall [was] aided by the votes of 61% of 'born-again' white Protestants."

The <a href="Gallup%20%28company%29">Gallup Organization</a> reported that "In 2003, 42% of U.S. adults said they were born-again or evangelical; the 2004 percentage is 41%" and that, "<a href="African%20American">Black Americans</a> are far more likely to identify themselves as born-again or evangelical, with 63% of blacks saying they are born-again, compared with 39% of <a href="white%20American">white American</a>s. <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> are far more likely to say they are born-again (52%) than <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> (36%) or independents (32%)."

Haiven refers to "born-agains" as having "a type of intolerance". She says, "The instant and thoughtless panaceas of born-again Christianity will be seen as a vast sanctuary by millions of North Americans." She continues, "Is this sanctuary really a recruitment camp for <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right-wing movements</a>? It would be naive to think otherwise."

"The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics", referring to several studies, reports "that 'born-again' identification is associated with lower support for government anti-poverty programs." It also notes that "self-reported born-again" Christianity, "strongly shapes attitudes towards economic policy."

The idea of "rebirth in Christ" has inspired some common European <a href="Given%20name">forenames</a>: French <a href="Ren%C3%A9">René</a>/<a href="Ren%C3%A9e">Renée</a>, Dutch Renaat/Renate, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese <a href="Renatus">Renato/Renata</a>, Latin <a href="Renatus">Renatus</a>/Renata, which all mean "reborn", "born again".

Rockwell B-1 Lancer

The Rockwell B-1 Lancer is a supersonic <a href="variable-sweep%20wing">variable-sweep wing</a>, <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> used by the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF). It is commonly called the "Bone" (from "B-One"). It is one of three <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a>s in the USAF fleet , the other two being the <a href="B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> "Stealth Bomber", and the <a href="B-52%20Stratofortress">B-52 Stratofortress</a>.

The B-1 was first envisioned in the 1960s as a platform that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the <a href="B-58%20Hustler">B-58 Hustler</a> with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. After a long series of studies, <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a> (now part of <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the <a href="AGM-86%20ALCM">AGM-86 ALCM</a> <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a> that flew the same basic profile, and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1. This led to the program being cancelled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.

The program was restarted in 1981, largely as an interim measure while the stealth bomber entered service. This led to a redesign as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign, and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a> (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.

In the early 1990s, following the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the newly formed <a href="Air%20Combat%20Command">Air Combat Command</a> (ACC), the B-1B was converted to conventional bombing use. It first served in combat during <a href="Bombing%20of%20Iraq%20%281998%29">Operation Desert Fox</a> in 1998 and again during the <a href="NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">NATO action in Kosovo</a> the following year. The B-1B has supported U.S. and <a href="NATO">NATO</a> military forces in <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a>. The USAF had 66 B-1Bs in service as of September 2012. The B-1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2030s, with the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-21%20Raider">Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider</a> to begin replacing the B-1B after 2025. The B-1s currently in inventory will reach the end of their service lives by 2045.

In 1955, the USAF issued requirements for a new bomber combining the payload and range of the <a href="Boeing%20B-52%20Stratofortress">Boeing B-52 Stratofortress</a> with the Mach 2 maximum speed of the <a href="Convair%20B-58%20Hustler">Convair B-58 Hustler</a>. In December 1957, the USAF selected <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a>'s <a href="North%20American%20XB-70%20Valkyrie">B-70 Valkyrie</a> for this role. The Valkyrie was a six-engine bomber that could cruise at <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 3 at high altitude (). Soviet <a href="interceptor%20aircraft">interceptor aircraft</a>, the only effective anti-bomber weapon in the 1950s, were already unable to intercept the high-flying <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">Lockheed U-2</a>; the Valkyrie would fly at similar altitudes, but much higher speeds, and was expected to fly right by the fighters.

By the late 1950s, however, antiaircraft <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>s (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft, as demonstrated by the <a href="1960%20U-2%20incident">1960 downing</a> of <a href="Gary%20Powers">Gary Powers</a>' U-2. The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) was aware of these developments and had begun moving its bombers to low-level penetration even before the U-2 downing. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances through the use of <a href="terrain%20mask%23Terrain%20masking">terrain masking</a>; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, the line-of-sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing the target. Additionally, radars of the era were subject to "<a href="clutter%20%28radar%29">clutter</a>" from stray returns from the ground and other objects, which meant a minimum angle existed above the horizon where they could detect a target. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by keeping their distance from the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft. The same effects also meant that low-flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher-flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections (lack of <a href="look-down/shoot-down">look-down/shoot-down</a> capability).

The switch from high-altitude to low-altitude flight profiles severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned to provide the desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a> at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a> (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.

Although never intended for the low-level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as the nature of the air war environment changed. The B-52's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times, and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved <a href="radar%20jamming%20and%20deception">radar jamming and deception</a> suites to deal with radars. During the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head, and the "big belly" modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to , turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes. The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have made it much less useful in this role.

Although effective, the B-52 was not ideal for the low-level role. This led to a number of aircraft designs known as <a href="penetrator%20%28aircraft%29">penetrators</a>, which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark">F-111</a> fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions. Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the <a href="BAC%20TSR-2">BAC TSR-2</a>, and later, <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Panavia Tornado</a> and <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-24">Sukhoi Su-24</a>. A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.

The first post-B-70 strategic penetrator study was known as the Subsonic Low-Altitude Bomber (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, <a href="T-tail">T-tail</a>, and large <a href="turbofan">high-bypass engines</a>. This was followed by the similar Extended Range Strike Aircraft (ERSA), which added a <a href="variable-sweep%20wing">variable-sweep wing</a>, then in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a payload and a range of , with being flown at low altitudes. In August 1963, the similar Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a bomb load and somewhat shorter range of .

These all culminated in the October 1963 Advanced Manned Precision Strike System (AMPSS), which led to industry studies at <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>, <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, and <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American</a>. In mid-1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft (AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, similar to that of the existing Mach 2 class <a href="Convair%20B-58%20Hustler">Convair B-58 Hustler</a>. Given the lengthy series of design studies, Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for "America's Most Studied Aircraft".

The arguments that led to the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the <a href="nuclear%20triad">nuclear triad</a> concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and <a href="submarine-launched%20ballistic%20missile">submarine-launched ballistic missile</a>s (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe <a href="counterforce">counterforce</a> option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the <a href="LGM-30%20Minuteman">Minuteman III</a>, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. <a href="Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.

Program studies continued; <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and <a href="Autonetics">Autonetics</a> were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968. McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor of upgrading the existing B-52 fleet and adding nearly 300 <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111%20Aardvark%23Variants">FB-111</a>s for shorter range roles then being filled by the B-58. He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development in 1968.

President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> reestablished the AMSA program after taking office, keeping with his administration's <a href="flexible%20response">flexible response</a> strategy that required a <a href="Single%20Integrated%20Operations%20Plan%23Counterforce%20migrates%20to%20deterrence%20and%20warfighting">broad range of options short of general nuclear war</a>. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, <a href="Melvin%20Laird">Melvin Laird</a>, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the "B-1A". This was the first entry in the <a href="1962%20United%20States%20Tri-Service%20aircraft%20designation%20system">new bomber designation series</a>, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.

Proposals were submitted by Boeing, General Dynamics and North American Rockwell in January 1970. In June 1970, North American Rockwell's design was selected and was awarded a development contract. The original program called for two test airframes, five flyable aircraft, and 40 engines. This was cut in 1971 to one ground and three flight test aircraft. The company changed its name to <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a> and named its aircraft division North American Aircraft Operations in 1973. A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with <a href="initial%20operational%20capability">initial operational capability</a> set for 1979.

Rockwell's design featured a number of features common to 1960s U.S. designs. Among these was the use of a <a href="escape%20crew%20capsule">crew escape capsule</a> that ejected as a unit during emergencies, which was introduced to improve survivability in the case of an ejection at high speed. Additionally, the design featured large variable-sweep wings in order to provide both high <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> during takeoff and landing, and low drag during a high-speed dash phase. With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases. Penetration of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s defenses would take place at <a href="supersonic%20speed">supersonic speed</a>, crossing them as quickly as possible before entering into the less defended "heartland" where speeds could be reduced again. The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow the "dash" portion of the flight to be relatively long.

In order to achieve the required Mach 2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air <a href="intake%20ramp">intake ramp</a>s were variable. Initially, it had been expected that a Mach 1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach 0.85, reducing the amount of titanium and therefore cost. A pair of small <a href="Canard%20%28aeronautics%29">vanes</a> mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride. The first three B-1As featured the escape capsule that ejected the cockpit with all four crew members inside. The fourth B-1A was equipped with a conventional <a href="ejection%20seat">ejection seat</a> for each crew member.

The B-1A mockup review occurred in late October 1971. The first B-1A prototype (Air Force serial no. 74-0158) flew on 23 December 1974. Three more B-1A prototypes followed. As the program continued the per-unit cost continued to rise in part because of high <a href="inflation">inflation</a> during that period. In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.

In 1976, Soviet pilot <a href="Viktor%20Belenko">Viktor Belenko</a> defected to <a href="Japan">Japan</a> with his <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-25">MiG-25 "Foxbat"</a>. During debriefing he described a new "super-Foxbat" (almost certainly referring to the <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-31">MiG-31</a>) that had <a href="look-down/shoot-down">look-down/shoot-down</a> <a href="radar">radar</a> in order to attack cruise missiles. This would also make any low-level penetration aircraft "visible" and easy to attack. Given that the B-1's armament suite was similar to the B-52, and it now appeared no more likely to survive Soviet airspace than the B-52, the program was increasingly questioned. In particular, Senator <a href="William%20Proxmire">William Proxmire</a> continually derided the B-1 in public, arguing it was an outlandishly expensive dinosaur. During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201976">1976 federal election</a> campaign, <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> made it one of the Democratic Party's platforms, saying "The B-1 bomber is an example of a proposed system which should not be funded and would be wasteful of taxpayers' dollars."

When Carter took office in 1977 he ordered a review of the entire program. By this point the projected cost of the program had risen to over $100 million per aircraft, although this was lifetime cost over 20 years. He was informed of the relatively new work on <a href="stealth%20aircraft">stealth aircraft</a> that had started in 1975, and he decided that this was a better avenue of approach than the B-1. <a href="The%20Pentagon">Pentagon</a> officials also stated that the <a href="AGM-86%20ALCM">AGM-86</a> Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) launched from the existing B-52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace. With a range of , the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude like a bomber (with a much lower <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a> due to smaller size), and in much greater numbers at a lower cost. A small number of B-52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs, saturating the defense. A program to improve the B-52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost perhaps 20% of the price to deploy the planned 244 B-1As.

On 30 June 1977, Carter announced that the B-1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs, SLBMs, and a fleet of modernized B-52s armed with ALCMs. Carter called it "one of the most difficult decisions that I've made since I've been in office." No mention of the stealth work was made public with the program being <a href="Classified%20information">top secret</a>, but today it is known that in early 1978 he authorized the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project, which eventually led to the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a>.

Domestically, the reaction to the cancellation was split along partisan lines. The Department of Defense was surprised by the announcement; internal expectations were that the number of B-1s ordered would be reduced to around 150. Congressman <a href="Robert%20Dornan">Robert Dornan</a> (R-CA) claimed, "They're breaking out the vodka and caviar in Moscow." In contrast, it appears the Soviets were more concerned by large numbers of ALCMs representing a much greater threat than a smaller number of B-1s. Soviet news agency <a href="Telegraph%20Agency%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">TASS</a> commented that "the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race." Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision. NATO commander <a href="Alexander%20Haig">Alexander Haig</a> described the ALCM as an "attractive alternative" to the B-1. French General Georges Buis stated "The B-1 is a formidable weapon, but not terribly useful. For the price of one bomber, you can have 200 cruise missiles."

Flight tests of the four B-1A prototypes for the B-1A program continued through April 1981. The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours. A top speed of Mach 2.22 was reached by the second B-1A. Engine testing also continued during this time with the YF101 engines totaling almost 7,600 hours.

It was during this period that the Soviets started to assert themselves in several new theaters of action, in particular through <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n proxies during the <a href="Angolan%20Civil%20War">Angolan Civil War</a> starting in 1975 and the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a> in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on <a href="containment">containing</a> <a href="Communism">Communism</a> and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.

The U.S. Department of Defense responded by accelerating its <a href="United%20States%20Rapid%20Deployment%20Forces">Rapid Deployment Forces</a> concept but suffered from major problems with airlift and sealift capability. In order to slow an enemy invasion of other countries, air power was critical; however the key Iran-Afghanistan border was outside the range of the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>'s carrier-based attack aircraft, leaving this role to the U.S. Air Force. Although the B-52 had the range to support on-demand global missions, its long runway requirements limited the forward basing possibilities.

During the 1980 presidential campaign, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> campaigned heavily on the platform that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, <a href="Harold%20Brown%20%28Secretary%20of%20Defense%29">Harold Brown</a>, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently implying that this was the reason for the B-1 cancellation.

On taking office, Reagan was faced with the same decision as Carter before: whether to continue with the B-1 for the short term, or to wait for the development of the ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with <a href="Air-launched%20cruise%20missile">ALCM</a> would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the <a href="SA-10">SA-10</a> missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet <a href="Airborne%20Early%20Warning%20and%20Control">Airborne Early Warning and Control</a> (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the "Long-Range Combat Aircraft" (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations. 

In 1981, it was believed the B-1 could be in operation before the <a href="Advanced%20Technology%20Bomber">ATB</a>, covering the transitional period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the ATB's introduction. Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B-1 and ATB, and on 2 October 1981 he announced that 100 B-1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role.

In January 1982, the U.S. Air Force awarded two contracts to Rockwell worth a combined $2.2 billion for the development and production of 100 new B-1 bombers. Numerous changes were made to the design to make it better suited to the now expected missions, resulting in the new "B-1B". These changes included a reduction in maximum speed, which allowed the variable-aspect <a href="Inlet%20cone">intake ramp</a>s to be replaced by simpler fixed geometry intake ramps in the newer design. This reduced the B-1B's radar signature or <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a>; this reduction was seen as a good trade off for the speed decrease. High subsonic speeds at low altitude became a focus area for the revised design, and low-level speeds were increased from about Mach 0.85 to 0.92. The B-1B has a maximum speed of Mach 1.25 at higher altitudes.

The B-1B's maximum takeoff weight was increased to from the B-1A's . The weight increase was to allow for takeoff with a full internal fuel load and for external weapons to be carried. Rockwell engineers were able to reinforce critical areas and lighten non-critical areas of the airframe, so the increase in <a href="Basic%20aircraft%20empty%20weight">empty weight</a> was minimal. To deal with the introduction of the <a href="MiG-31">MiG-31</a> equipped with the new <a href="Zaslon">Zaslon</a> radar system, and other aircraft with <a href="Look-down/shoot-down">look-down</a> capability (which reduced the B-1s low-flying advantage), the B-1B's <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> suite was significantly upgraded.
Opposition to the plan was widespread within Congress. Critics pointed out that many of the original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense. In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal. It also appeared that the "interim" time frame served by the B-1B would be less than a decade, being rendered obsolete shortly after the introduction of a much more capable ATB design. The primary argument in favor of the B-1 was its large <a href="conventional%20weapon">conventional weapon</a> payload, and that its takeoff performance allowed it to operate with a credible bomb load from a much wider variety of airfields. The USAF spread production subcontracts across many congressional districts, making the aircraft more popular on <a href="Capitol%20Hill">Capitol Hill</a>.

B-1A #1 was disassembled and used for radar testing at the <a href="Rome%20Laboratory">Rome Air Development Center</a> at the former <a href="Griffiss%20Air%20Force%20Base">Griffiss Air Force Base</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. B-1As #2 and #4 were then modified to include B-1B systems. The first B-1B was completed and began flight testing in March 1983. The first production B-1B was rolled out on 4 September 1984 and first flew on 18 October 1984. The 100th and final B-1B was delivered on 2 May 1988; before the last B-1B was delivered, the USAF had determined that the aircraft was vulnerable to Soviet air defenses.

The B-1 has a <a href="blended%20wing%20body">blended wing body</a> configuration, with <a href="variable-sweep%20wing">variable-sweep wing</a>, four <a href="turbofan">turbofan engines</a>, triangular fin control surfaces and <a href="cruciform%20tail">cruciform tail</a>. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward-swept wing settings are used for <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a>, <a href="landing">landing</a>s and high-altitude maximum <a href="cruise%20%28flight%29">cruise</a>. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight. The B-1's variable-sweep wings and <a href="thrust-to-weight%20ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a> provide it with improved takeoff performance, allowing it to use shorter runways than previous bombers. The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System rotates the vanes automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride.
Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach 2+ speeds; its maximum speed is Mach 1.25 (about 950 mph or 1,530 km/h at altitude), but its low-level speed increased to Mach 0.92 (700 mph, 1,130 km/h). The speed of the current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses <a href="serpentine%20shape">serpentine</a> air <a href="intake">intake ducts</a> (see <a href="S-duct">S-duct</a>) and fixed <a href="intake%20ramp">intake ramp</a>s, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.

The B-1A's engine was modified slightly to produce the <a href="General%20Electric%20F101">GE F101-102</a> for the B-1B, with an emphasis on durability, and increased efficiency. The core of this engine has since been re-used in several other engine designs, including the <a href="General%20Electric%20F110">GE F110</a> which has seen use in the F-14 Tomcat, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle">F-15K/SG</a> variants and most recent versions of the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>. It is also the basis for the non-<a href="afterburner">afterburning</a> <a href="General%20Electric%20F118">GE F118</a> used in the B-2 Spirit and the <a href="Lockheed%20U-2">U-2S</a>. The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular <a href="CFM%20International%20CFM56">CFM56</a> civil engine, which can be found on some versions of practically every small-to-medium-sized airliner. The nose gear cover door has controls for the <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>s (APUs), which allow for quick starts of the APUs upon order to scramble.

The B-1's main computer is the <a href="IBM%20AP-101">IBM AP-101</a>, which is also used on the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20orbiter">Space Shuttle orbiter</a> and the B-52 bomber. The computer is programmed with the <a href="JOVIAL%20%28programming%20language%29">JOVIAL</a> programming language. The Lancer's offensive <a href="avionics">avionics</a> include the <a href="Westinghouse%20Electronic%20Systems">Westinghouse</a> (now <a href="Northrop%20Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>) AN/APQ-164 forward-looking offensive <a href="passive%20electronically%20scanned%20array">passive electronically scanned array</a> radar set with electronic beam steering (and a fixed antenna pointed downward for reduced radar observability), <a href="synthetic%20aperture%20radar">synthetic aperture radar</a>, ground <a href="moving%20target%20indication">moving target indication</a> (GMTI), and <a href="terrain-following%20radar">terrain-following radar</a> modes, <a href="Doppler%20radar%23Doppler%20navigation">Doppler navigation</a>, <a href="radar%20altimeter">radar altimeter</a>, and an <a href="inertial%20navigation">inertial navigation</a> suite. The B-1B Block D upgrade added a <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS) receiver beginning in 1995.

The B-1's defensive electronics include the <a href="Eaton%20Corporation">Eaton</a> AN/ALQ-161A <a href="Radar%20warning%20receiver">radar warning</a> and defensive <a href="Radar%20jamming%20and%20deception">jamming</a> equipment, which has three sets of antennas; one at the front base of each wing and the third rear-facing in the tail <a href="radome">radome</a>. Also in the tail radome is the <a href="AN/ALQ-153">AN/ALQ-153</a> <a href="missile%20approach%20warning%20system">missile approach warning system</a> (<a href="pulse-Doppler%20radar">pulse-Doppler radar</a>). The ALQ-161 is linked to a total of eight AN/ALE-49 <a href="Flare%20%28countermeasure%29">flare</a> dispensers located on top behind the canopy, which are handled by the AN/ASQ-184 avionics management system. Each AN/ALE-49 dispenser has a capacity of 12 MJU-23A/B flares. The MJU-23A/B flare is one of the world's largest <a href="infrared%20countermeasure">infrared countermeasure</a> flares at a weight of over . The B-1 has also been equipped to carry the <a href="ALE-50%20towed%20decoy%20system">ALE-50 towed decoy system</a>.

Also aiding the B-1's survivability is its relatively low <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a> (RCS). Although not technically a <a href="stealth%20aircraft">stealth aircraft</a> in a comprehensive sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of <a href="radar-absorbent%20material">radar-absorbent material</a> its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26 ft² or 2.4 m², roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>.

The B-1 has been upgraded since production, beginning with the "Conventional Mission Upgrade Program" (CMUP), which added a new <a href="MIL-STD-1760">MIL-STD-1760</a> smart-weapons interface to enable the use of precision-guided conventional weapons. CMUP began with Block A, which was the standard B-1B with the capability to deliver non-precision gravity bombs. Block B brought an improved Synthetic Aperture Radar, and upgrades to the Defensive Countermeasures System and was fielded in 1995. Block C provided an "enhanced capability" for delivery of up to 30 cluster bomb units (CBUs) per <a href="sortie">sortie</a> with modifications made to 50 bomb racks.

Block D added a "Near Precision Capability" via improved weapons and targeting systems, and added advanced secure communications capabilities. The first part of the electronic countermeasures upgrade added <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">Joint Direct Attack Munition</a> (JDAM), <a href="ALE-50%20towed%20decoy%20system">ALE-50 towed decoy system</a>, and anti-jam radios. Block E upgraded the avionics computers and incorporated the <a href="Wind%20Corrected%20Munitions%20Dispenser">Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser</a> (WCMD), the <a href="AGM-154%20Joint%20Standoff%20Weapon">AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon</a> (JSOW) and the <a href="AGM-158%20JASSM">AGM-158 JASSM</a> (Joint Air to Surface Standoff Munition), substantially improving the bomber's capability. Upgrades were completed in September 2006. Block F was the Defensive Systems Upgrade Program (DSUP) to improve the aircraft's electronic countermeasures and jamming capabilities, but it was canceled in December 2002 due to cost overruns and schedule slips.

In 2005, a program began to upgrade crew stations and integrate data linking. A B-1 equipped with the fully integrated data link (FIDL) first flew on 29 July 2009; the FIDL enables electronic data sharing, eliminating the need to enter information between systems by hand. In January 2013, Boeing delivered the first integrated battle station (IBS) equipped B-1. This replaced several displays with new multi-function color display units, an upgraded central integrated test system, and a newer aircraft performance monitoring computer. In June 2012, the B-1Bs are receiving Sustainment-Block 16 upgrades to add <a href="Link%2016">Link 16</a> networking and digital flight instrumentation.

In 2007, the <a href="Sniper%20Advanced%20Targeting%20Pod">Sniper XR</a> targeting pod was integrated on the B-1 fleet. The pod is mounted on an external hardpoint at the aircraft's chin near the forward bomb bay. Following accelerated testing, the Sniper pod was fielded in summer 2008. Future precision munitions include the <a href="Small%20Diameter%20Bomb">Small Diameter Bomb</a>. In 2011, the Air Force was considering upgrading B-1s with multiple ejector racks so that they can carry three times as many smaller JDAMs than previously.

In February 2014, work began on a multi-year upgrade of 62 B-1Bs, scheduled to be completed by 2019. The vertical situation display upgrade (VSDU) replaces existing flight instruments with multifunction color displays, a second display aids with threat evasion and targeting, and act as a back-up display. Additional memory capacity is to be installed for the diagnostics database. Procurement and installation of the IBS upgrades is expected to cost $918 million, research and engineering costs are estimated at $391 million. Other additions are to replace the two spinning mass gyroscopic inertial navigation system with <a href="ring%20laser%20gyroscope">ring laser gyroscopic</a> systems and a GPS antenna, replacement of the <a href="AN/APG-66">APQ-164 radar</a> with the Scalable Agile Beam Radar – Global Strike (<a href="SABR-GS">SABR-GS</a>) <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a>, and a new attitude indicator.

The second B-1B, "The Star of Abilene", was the first B-1B delivered to the USAF <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a> (SAC) in June 1985. Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986 and the B-1B was placed on nuclear alert status. The B-1 received the official name "Lancer" on 15 March 1990. However, the bomber has been commonly called the "Bone"; a nickname that appears to stem from an early newspaper article on the aircraft wherein its name was phonetically spelled out as "B-ONE" with the hyphen inadvertently omitted.
In late 1990, engine fires in two Lancers led to a grounding of the fleet. The cause was traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, the aircraft were placed on "limited alert"; in other words, they were grounded unless a nuclear war broke out. Following inspections and repairs they were returned to duty beginning on 6 February 1991. By 1991, the B-1 had a fledgling conventional capability, forty of them able to drop the Mk-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb, although mostly from low altitude. Despite being cleared for this role, the problems with the engines prevented their use in <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. B-1s were primarily reserved for strategic nuclear strike missions at this time, providing the role of airborne nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union. The B-52 was more suited to the role of conventional warfare and it was used by coalition forces instead.

Originally designed strictly for nuclear war, the B-1's development as an effective conventional bomber was delayed. The collapse of the Soviet Union had brought the B-1's nuclear role into question, leading to President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> ordering a $3 billion conventional refit. 

After the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the establishment of the <a href="Air%20Combat%20Command">Air Combat Command</a> (ACC) in 1992, the B-1 developed a greater conventional weapons capability. Part of this development was the start-up of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School B-1 Division. In 1994, two additional B-1 bomb wings were also created in the <a href="Air%20National%20Guard">Air National Guard</a>, with former fighter wings in the <a href="Kansas%20Air%20National%20Guard">Kansas Air National Guard</a> and the <a href="Georgia%20Air%20National%20Guard">Georgia Air National Guard</a> converting to the aircraft. By the mid-1990s, the B-1 could employ GP weapons as well as various CBUs. By the end of the 1990s, with the advent of the "Block D" upgrade, the B-1 boasted a full array of guided and unguided munitions. 

The B-1B no longer carries nuclear weapons; its nuclear capability was disabled by 1995 with the removal of nuclear arming and fuzing hardware. Under provisions of the <a href="New%20START">New START</a> treaty with Russia, further conversion were performed. These included modification of aircraft hardpoints to prevent nuclear weapon pylons from being attached, removal of weapons bay wiring bundles for arming nuclear weapons, and destruction of nuclear weapon pylons. The conversion process was completed in 2011, and Russian officials inspect the aircraft every year to verify compliance.

The B-1 was first used in combat in support of operations in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> during <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a> in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons. B-1s have been subsequently used in <a href="Operation%20Allied%20Force">Operation Allied Force</a> (Kosovo) and, most notably, in <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001-present%29">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in Afghanistan and the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. The B-1's role in Operation Allied Force has been criticized as the aircraft was not used until after enemy defenses had been suppressed by aircraft like the older B-52 it was intended to replace. The B-1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones, most notably the GBU-31, <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">Joint Direct Attack Munition</a> (JDAM). In the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance, including some 3,900 JDAMs. JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B-1 over Iraq, notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and his two sons. At the height of the Iraq War, a B-1 was continuously kept airborne to provide rapid precision bombardment upon important targets as intelligence identified them. During Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-1 was able to raise its <a href="availability">mission capable rate</a> to 79%.

The B-1 has higher survivability and speed than the older B-52, which it was intended to replace. It also holds 61 <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20A%C3%A9ronautique%20Internationale">FAI</a> world records for speed, payload, distance, and time-to-climb in different aircraft weight classes. In November 1993, three B-1Bs set a long distance record for the aircraft, which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base without any stops. The <a href="National%20Aeronautic%20Association">National Aeronautic Association</a> recognized the B-1B for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994.

Of the 100 B-1Bs built, 93 remained in 2000 after losses in accidents. In June 2001, the Pentagon sought to place one-third of its then fleet into storage; this proposal resulted in several U.S. Air National Guard officers and members of Congress lobbying against the proposal, including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts. The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B-1Bs, such as computer modernization. In 2003, accompanied by the removal of B-1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard, the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B-1Bs. In 2004, a new <a href="appropriation%20bill">appropriation bill</a> called for some of the retired aircraft to return to service, and the USAF returned seven mothballed bombers to service to increase the fleet to 67 aircraft.
On 14 July 2007, the Associated Press reported on the growing USAF presence in Iraq, including reintroduction of B-1Bs as a close-at-hand platform to support Coalition ground forces. Since 2008, B-1s have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan in an "armed overwatch" role, loitering for surveillance purposes while ready to deliver guided bombs in support of ground troops if contacted.

The B-1B underwent a series of flight tests using a 50/50 mix of synthetic and petroleum fuel; on 19 March 2008, a B-1B from <a href="Dyess%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dyess Air Force Base</a>, Texas, became the first USAF aircraft to fly at supersonic speed using a <a href="synthetic%20fuel">synthetic fuel</a> during a flight over Texas and New Mexico. This was conducted as part of an ongoing Air Force testing and certification program to reduce reliance on traditional oil sources. On 4 August 2008, a B-1B flew the first <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20Sniper%20XR">Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod</a> equipped combat sortie where the crew successfully targeted enemy ground forces and dropped a GBU-38 guided bomb in Afghanistan.

In March 2011, B-1Bs from <a href="Ellsworth%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ellsworth Air Force Base</a> attacked undisclosed targets in <a href="Libya">Libya</a> as part of <a href="Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a>. 

With upgrades to keep the B-1 viable, the air force may keep it in service until approximately 2038. Despite upgrades, the B-1 has repair and cost issues; every flight hour needs 48.4 hours of repair. The fuel, repairs, and other needs for a 12-hour mission cost $720,000 as of 2010. The $63,000 cost per flight hour is, however, less than the $72,000 for the B-52 and the $135,000 of the B-2. In June 2010, senior USAF officials met to consider retiring the entire fleet to meet budget cuts. The Pentagon plans to begin replacing the aircraft with the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-21%20Raider">Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider</a> after 2025. In the meantime, its "capabilities are particularly well-suited to the vast distances and unique challenges of the Pacific region, and we'll continue to invest in, and rely on, the B-1 in support of the focus on the Pacific" as part of President Obama's <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations%23Obama%20administration">"Pivot to East Asia"</a>.

In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron returned from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, the most of any B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500 lb <a href="GBU-54">GBU-54</a> bombs, 500 lb and 2,000 lb <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">Joint Direct Attack Munition</a>s (JDAM), and <a href="Long%20Range%20Anti-Ship%20Missile">Long Range Anti-Ship Missile</a>s (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.

The USAF had 66 B-1Bs in service in September 2012, split among four squadrons organized into two Bomb Wings: the 7th Bomb Wing at <a href="Dyess%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dyess AFB</a>, Texas, and the 28th Bomb Wing at <a href="Ellsworth%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ellsworth AFB</a>, South Dakota.

Beginning in 2014, the B-1 was used by the U.S. against the Islamic State (IS) in the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a>. From August 2014 to January 2015, the B-1 accounted for eight percent of USAF sorties during <a href="Operation%20Inherent%20Resolve">Operation Inherent Resolve</a>. The 9th Bomb Squadron was deployed to Qatar in July 2014 to support missions in Afghanistan, but when the air campaign against IS began on 8 August, the aircraft were employed in Iraq. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kobane">Battle of Kobane</a> in Syria, the squadron's B-1s dropped 660 bombs over 5 months in support of Kurdish forces defending the city, one-third of all bombs used during OIR during the period, killing some 1,000 ISIL fighters. The 9th Bomb Squadron’s B-1s went "Winchester", dropping all weapons on board, 31 times during their deployment. They dropped over 2,000 JDAMs during the 6-month rotation. B-1s from the 28th Bomb Wing flew 490 sorties where they dropped 3,800 munitions on 3,700 targets during a six-month deployment. In February 2016, the B-1s were sent back to the U.S. for cockpit upgrades.

As part of a USAF organizational realignment announced in April 2015, all B-1B aircraft are to be reassigned from Air Combat Command to <a href="Global%20Strike%20Command">Global Strike Command</a> (GSC) effective 1 October 2015.

On 8 July 2017, the USAF flew two B-1 Lancers near the North Korean border in a show of force amid increasing tensions, particularly in response to North Korea's 4 July test of an ICBM capable of reaching Alaska.


The USAF had 66 B-1Bs in service as of 2012.


Ten B-1s have been lost due to accidents. Between 1984 and 2001, 17 crew members and people on board were killed in B-1 accidents.

pageRank.Book of Common Prayer

The pageRank.Book of Common Prayer (BCP) is the short title of a number of related <a href="prayer%20book">prayer book</a>s used in the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, as well as by the <a href="Continuing%20Anglican">Continuing Anglican</a>, "<a href="Anglican%20realignment">Anglican realignment</a>" and other Anglican churches. The original book, published in 1549 in the reign of <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>, was a product of the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> following the break with <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Rome</a>. Prayer books, unlike books of prayers, contain the words of structured (or <a href="liturgical">liturgical</a>) services of worship. The work of 1549 was the first prayer book to include the complete forms of service for daily and Sunday worship in English. It contained <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning Prayer</a>, <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a>, the <a href="Litany">Litany</a>, and <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a> and also the occasional services in full: the orders for <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a>, <a href="Confirmation">Confirmation</a>, <a href="Marriage">Marriage</a>, "<a href="Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick">prayers to be said with the sick</a>", and a <a href="funeral">funeral</a> service. It also set out in full the "<a href="propers">propers</a>" (that is the parts of the service which varied week by week or, at times, daily throughout the Church's Year): the <a href="collect">collect</a>s and the <a href="epistle">epistle</a> and <a href="gospel">gospel</a> readings for the Sunday Communion Service. <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> readings for daily prayer were specified in tabular format as were the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>; and <a href="canticles">canticles</a>, mostly biblical, that were provided to be said or sung between the readings .

The 1549 book was soon succeeded by a more reformed revision in 1552 under the same editorial hand, that of <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. It was used only for a few months, as after Edward VI's death in 1553, his half-sister <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a> restored Roman Catholic worship. Mary died in 1558 and, in 1559, <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> reintroduced the 1552 book with a few modifications to make it acceptable to more traditionally minded worshippers, notably the inclusion of the words of administration from the 1549 Communion Service alongside those of 1552.

In 1604, <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> ordered some further changes, the most significant of these being the addition to the Catechism of a section on the Sacraments. Following the tumultuous events leading to and including the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, another major revision was published in 1662 . That edition has remained the official prayer book of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, although in the 21st century, alternative provision under the title "<a href="Common%20Worship">Common Worship</a>" has largely displaced the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" at the main Sunday worship service of most English parish churches.

A "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" with local variations is used in churches inside and outside the Anglican Communion in over 50 different countries and in over 150 different languages . In many parts of the world, other books have replaced it in regular weekly worship.

Traditional English <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> and <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> prayer books have borrowed from the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" and the marriage and burial rites have found their way into those of other denominations and into the English language. Like the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and the works of <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, many words and phrases from the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" have entered common parlance.

The full name of the 1662 "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" is "The pageRank.Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the Church of England together with the Psalter or Psalms of David pointed as they are to be sung or said in churches; and the form and manner of making, ordaining, and consecrating of bishops, priests, and deacons".

The forms of parish worship in the late medieval church in England, which followed the Latin <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman Rite</a>, varied according to local practice. By far the most common form, or "use", found in Southern England was that of <a href="Use%20of%20Sarum">Sarum</a> (Salisbury). There was no single book; the services that would be provided by the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" were to be found in the <a href="Missal">Missal</a> (the Eucharist), the <a href="Roman%20Breviary">Breviary</a> (daily offices), Manual (the occasional services of Baptism, Marriage, Burial etc.), and <a href="Pontifical">Pontifical</a> (services appropriate to a <a href="bishop">bishop</a>—Confirmation, Ordination) . The chant (<a href="plainsong">plainsong</a>, <a href="plainchant">plainchant</a>) for worship was contained in the <a href="Roman%20Gradual">Roman Gradual</a> for the Mass and in the <a href="Antiphoner">Antiphoner</a> for the offices. The "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" has never contained prescribed music or chant; however, <a href="John%20Merbecke">John Merbecke</a> produced his "Booke of Common Praier noted" in 1550 which set what would have been the proper of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, etc.) in the new BCP to simple plainchant inspired by Sarum Use. The work of producing a liturgy in the English language books was largely done by <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, starting cautiously in the reign of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, and then more radically under his son <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>. In his early days Cranmer was somewhat conservative: an admirer, if a critical one, of <a href="John%20Fisher">John Fisher</a>. It may have been his visit to Germany in 1532 (where he secretly married) which began the change in his outlook. Then in 1538, as Henry began diplomatic negotiations with Lutheran princes, Cranmer came face to face with a Lutheran embassy . The <a href="Exhortation%20and%20Litany%20%281544%29">Exhortation and Litany</a>, the earliest English-language service of the Church of England, was the first overt manifestation of his changing views. It was no mere translation from the Latin: its <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> character is made clear by the drastic reduction of the place of saints, compressing what had been the major part into three petitions . Published in 1544, it borrowed greatly from <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s <a href="Litany">Litany</a> and <a href="Myles%20Coverdale">Myles Coverdale</a>'s <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> and was the only service that might be considered to be "<a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>" to be finished within the lifetime of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a>.

It was only on Henry's death in 1547 and the accession of Edward VI that revision could proceed faster. <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Cranmer</a> finished his work on an English <a href="Eucharist">Communion</a> rite in 1548, obeying an order of <a href="Convocation">Convocation</a> of the previous year that communion was to be given to the people as both bread and wine. The ordinary Roman Rite of the Mass had made no provision for any congregation present to receive communion in both species. So, Cranmer composed in English an additional rite of congregational preparation and communion (based on the form of the Sarum rite for Communion of the Sick), to be undertaken immediately following the communion, in both kinds, of the priest. 

Further developed, and fully translated into English, this Communion service 'commonly called the Mass' was included, one year later, in 1549, in a full prayer book, set out with daily offices, readings for Sundays and Holy Days, the Communion Service, Public <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a>, of <a href="Confirmation">Confirmation</a>, of <a href="Matrimony">Matrimony</a>, The Visitation of the Sick, At a Burial and the Ordinal (added in 1550) . The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began: "There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted." Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure . A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only "the service of the church ought to be in the mother tongue" . Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed . He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by <a href="Hermann%20of%20Wied">Hermann von Wied</a>, Archbishop of Cologne; and also from <a href="Andreas%20Osiander">Osiander</a> (to whom he was related by marriage) . The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly the work of the latter. Many phrases are characteristic of the German reformer <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a>, or of the Italian <a href="Pietro%20Martire%20Vermigli">Peter Martyr</a>, (who was staying with Cranmer at the time of the finalising of drafts), or of his chaplain, <a href="Thomas%20Becon">Thomas Becon</a>. However, to Cranmer is "credited the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book" including the systematic amendment of his materials to remove any idea that human merit contributed to their salvation .

The Communion service of 1549 maintained the format of distinct rites of <a href="consecration">consecration</a> and <a href="Communion%20rite">communion</a>, that had been introduced the previous year; but with the Latin rite of the Mass (chiefly following the familiar structure in the <a href="Use%20of%20Sarum">Use of Sarum</a>), translated into English. By outwardly maintaining familiar forms, Cranmer hoped to establish the practice of weekly congregational communion, and included exhortations to encourage this; and instructions that communion should never be received by the priest alone. This represented a radical change from late medieval practice—whereby the primary focus of congregational worship was taken to be attendance at the consecration, and adoration of the elevated consecrated host. In late medieval England, congregations regularly received communion only at <a href="Easter">Easter</a>; and otherwise individual lay people might expect to receive communion only when gravely ill, or in the form of a <a href="Nuptial%20Mass">Nuptial Mass</a> on being married. Doctrinally and most importantly Cranmer deleted any reference that the Eucharist is the Church's offering and an objective and material sacrifice by the Church to God in union with Christ was omitted from the Prayer of Consecration as had been the belief since the mid-second century as stated in the Consecration Prayers. Although fully aware of this Cranmer demonstrated his opposition to ancient practice (The Study of Liturgy, Editors, Jones, Wainwright, Yarnold SJ and Bradshaw, Revised Ediition 1992, p. 101-105) by omitting oblationary language in the prayer as it continued immediately after the Words of the Institution, "wherefore O Lord and Heavenly Father, according to the institution of thy dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make here thy Divine Majesty, with these they holy gifts, the memorial thy Son has willeth to make." Absent is an oblation of the gifts signified by language such as "which we present unto thee," or "bring before thee" or "offer unto thee." He made sure in the Second Prayer pageRank.Book Rite that no possible association could be made: the Prayer of Consecration ended with the Words of Institution. He also omitted the Epiclesis from the Second pageRank.Book. The recovery of oblation and the epiclesis would have to wait until the Scottish Non-Jurors in the 18th century did so, "which we now offer unto thee," placed after "holy gifts." The Episcopal Church USA adopted the formula in 1789: six words added to a modified version of the 1549 Prayer in effect repudiated Cranmer's theology of sacrifice which restricted to the communicants' offering themselves in an optional thanksgiving prayer. As for his theology of Christ's Presence it was Calvinistic Virtualism: Christ is present by the power of the Holy Spirit. However the 1549 Rite is ambiguous about this referring to the Eucharist as spiritual food but in to the Real Presence in the Words of Administration, "The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ," "The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ." The Non-Juror Rite asserted a kind of Virtualism while making the Eucharist a proper sacrifice, op. cit. p. 108, while the Elizabethan Settlement in one of the first moves to undo Cranmer left open the question of the Real Presence because the Queen insisted that the Words of Administration be from the 1549 pageRank.Book where the doctrine was implicit and include also the words from the 1552 pageRank.Book which are Receptionism. The 1559 pageRank.Book retained the truncated Prayer of Consecration which omitted any notion of objective sacrifice. It would be a long road back for the Church of England with no clear indication that it would retreat from the 1559 Settlement except for minor official changes. However, from the 17th century some prominent Anglican theologians tried to cast a more traditional interpretation onto it though the words of the rite might not carry. It not be until the Oxford Movement of the 19th century and 20th century revisions that the Church of England would attempt to deal with the Eucharisitic doctrines of Cranmer - focused on Receiving Christ, Virtiual Presence, Receptionism, and the eucharistic sacrifice confined to an optional Thanksgiving Prayer said by the communicants empowered to do so by having received - by bringing the Church back to "pre-Reformation doctrine," ibid. p. 108, which among other matters sees the congregation first offering itself through the Consecrated Elements, the Gifts of God, before receiving the same.

Cranmer's work of simplification and revision was also applied to the Daily Offices, which were to become <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning</a>, and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a>; and which he hoped would also serve as a daily form of prayer to be used by the Laity, thus replacing both the late medieval lay observation of the Latin <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Hours">Hours of the Virgin</a>, and its English equivalent, the "Primer". This simplification was anticipated by the work of Cardinal <a href="Francis%20Qui%C3%B1ones">Francis Quiñones</a>, a Spanish <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>, in his abortive revision of the Roman Breviary published in 1537 . Cranmer took up Quiñones's principle that everything should be sacrificed to secure continuity in singing the Psalter and reading the Bible. His first draft, produced during Henry's reign, retained the traditional seven distinct <a href="Canonical%20hours">Canonical hours</a> of Office prayer; but in his second draft, while he retained the Latin, he consolidated these into two . The 1549 book then dispensed with the Latin, and with all non-biblical readings; and established a rigorously biblical cycle of readings for Morning and Evening Prayer (set according to the calendar year, rather than the ecclesiastical year) and a Psalter to be read consecutively throughout each month. The readings provided that the New Testament (other than the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a>) be read through three times in a year, while the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, including the <a href="Biblical%20Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a> would be read through once. Of the set canticles, only the <a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a> was retained of the non-biblical material.

Introduced on Whitsunday 1549, after considerable debate and revision in Parliament—but there is no evidence that it was ever submitted to either Convocation—it was said to have pleased neither reformers nor their opponents, indeed the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Bishop <a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Gardiner</a> could say of it was that it "was patient of a catholic interpretation". It was clearly unpopular in the parishes of Devon and Cornwall where, along with severe social problems, its introduction was one of the causes of the "commotions", or rebellions in the summer of that year, partly because many Cornish people lacked sufficient English to understand it . [It appears that it was far less significant in the other "commotions" in the Home Counties and the "Eastern Rebellion".] Particularly unpopular was the banning of processions and the sending out of commissioners to enforce the new requirements. There was widespread opposition to the introduction of regular congregational Communion, partly because the extra costs of bread and wine that would fall on the parish; but mainly out of an intense resistance to undertaking in regular worship, a religious practice previously associated with marriage or illness.

The 1549 book was, from the outset, intended only as a temporary expedient, as Bucer was assured having met Cranmer for the first time in April 1549: 'concessions...made both as a respect for antiquity and to the infirmity of the present age' as he wrote . Both Bucer and Peter Martyr wrote detailed proposals for modification; Bucer's "Censura" ran to 28 chapters which influenced Cranmer significantly though he did not follow them slavishly and the new book was duly produced in 1552, making "fully perfect" what was already implicit . The policy of incremental reform was now unveiled: more Roman Catholic practices were now excised, as doctrines had in 1549 been subtly changed. Thus, in the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, gone were the words <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> and <a href="altar">altar</a>; the '<a href="Kyrie">Lord have mercy</a>' was interleaved into a recitation of the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> and the <a href="Gloria%20in%20Excelsis%20Deo">Gloria</a> was removed to the end of the service. The Eucharistic prayer was split in two so that Eucharistic bread and wine were shared immediately after the words of institution (This is my Body..This is my blood...in remembrance of me.); while its final element, the Prayer of Oblation, (with its reference to an offering of a 'Sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving'), was transferred, much changed, to a position after the priest and congregation had received Communion, and was made optional to an alternative prayer of thanksgiving. The Elevation of the Host had been forbidden in 1549; all manual acts were now omitted. The words at the administration of Communion which, in the prayer book of 1549 described the Eucharistic species as 'The body of our Lorde Jesus Christe...', 'The blood of our Lorde Jesus Christe...' were replaced with the words 'Take, eat, in remembrance that Christ died for thee..' etc. The Peace, at which in the early Church the congregation had exchanged a greeting, was removed altogether. Vestments such as the <a href="Stole%20%28vestment%29">stole</a>, <a href="chasuble">chasuble</a> and <a href="cope">cope</a> were no longer to be worn, but only a <a href="surplice">surplice</a>, removing all elements of sacrificial offering from the Latin Mass; so that it should cease to be seen as a ritual at which the priest, on behalf of the flock gave Christ to God; and might rather be seen as a ritual whereby Christ shared his body and blood, according to a different sacramental theology, with the faithful.

Cranmer recognized that the 1549 rite of Communion had been capable of conservative misinterpretation and misuse in that the consecration rite might still be undertaken even when no congregational Communion followed. Consequently, in 1552 he thoroughly integrated Consecration and Communion into a single rite, with congregational preparation preceding the words of institution—such that it would not be possible to mimic the Mass with the priest communicating alone. He appears nevertheless, to have been resigned to being unable for the present to establish in parishes the weekly practice of receiving Communion; so he restructured the service so as to allow ante-Communion as a distinct rite of worship—following the Communion rite through the readings and offertory, as far as the intercessory "Prayer for the Church Militant".

Diarmaid MacCulloch suggests that Cranmer's own Eucharistic theology in these years approximated most closely to that of <a href="Heinrich%20Bullinger">Heinrich Bullinger</a>; but that he intended the Prayer pageRank.Book to be acceptable to the widest range of Reformed Eucharistic belief, including the high sacramental theology of <a href="Bucer">Bucer</a> and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> . At the same time, however, Cranmer intended that constituent parts of the rites gathered into the Prayer pageRank.Book should still, so far as possible, be recognizably derived from traditional forms and elements.

In the baptism service, the signing with the cross was moved until after the baptism and the exorcism, the anointing, the putting on of the chrysom robe and the triple immersion were omitted. Most drastic of all was the removal of the Burial service from church: it was to take place at the graveside . In 1549, there had been provision for a Requiem (not so called) and prayers of commendation and committal, the first addressed to the deceased. All that remained was a single reference to the deceased, giving thanks for their delivery from 'the myseryes of this sinneful world'. This new Order for the Burial of the Dead was a drastically stripped-down memorial service designed to undermine definitively the whole complex of traditional beliefs about Purgatory and intercessory prayer .

In other respects, however, both the Baptism and Burial services imply a theology of salvation that accords notably less with <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> teachings than do the counterpart passages in the <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion</a>. In the Burial service, the possibility that a deceased person who has died in the faith may nevertheless not be counted amongst God's <a href="predestination">elect</a>, is not entertained. In the Baptism service the priest explicitly pronounces the baptised infant as being now "<a href="baptismal%20regeneration">regenerate</a>". In both cases, conformity with strict Reformed Protestant principles would have resulted in a conditional formulation. The continued inconsistency between the Articles of Religion and the Prayer pageRank.Book remained a point of contention for Puritans; and would in the 19th century come close to tearing the Church of England apart, through the course of the <a href="Gorham%20judgement">Gorham judgement</a>.

The Orders of Morning and Evening Prayer were extended by the inclusion of a penitential section at the beginning including a corporate confession of sin and a general absolution, although the text was printed only in Morning Prayer with rubrical directions to use it in the evening as well. The general pattern of Bible reading in 1549 was retained (as it was in 1559) except that distinct Old and New Testament readings were now specified for Morning and Evening Prayer on certain feast days. Following the publication of the 1552 Prayer pageRank.Book, a revised English Primer was published in 1553; adapting the Offices and Morning and Evening Prayer, and other prayers, for lay domestic piety .

The 1552 book, however, was used only for a short period, as Edward VI had died in the summer of 1553 and, as soon as she could do so, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a>, restored union with Rome. The Latin Mass was re-established, altars, roods and statues were reinstated; an attempt was made to restore the English Church to its Roman affiliation. Cranmer was punished for his work in the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> by being burned at the stake on 21 March 1556. Nevertheless, the 1552 book was to survive. After Mary's death in 1558, it became the primary source for the Elizabethan pageRank.Book of Common Prayer, with subtle if significant changes only.

Hundreds of Protestants fled into exile—establishing an English church in <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt am Main</a>. A bitter and very public dispute ensued between those, such as <a href="Edmund%20Grindal">Edmund Grindal</a> and <a href="Richard%20Cox%20%28bishop%29">Richard Cox</a>, who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the 1552 Prayer pageRank.Book; and those, such as <a href="John%20Knox">John Knox</a> the minister of the congregation, who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise. Eventually, in 1555, the civil authorities expelled Knox and his supporters to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where they adopted a new prayer book, "The Form of Prayers", which derived principally from Calvin's French "La Forme des Prières" . Consequently, when the accession of <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Elizabeth I</a> re-asserted the dominance of the reformed Church of England, there remained a significant body of more Protestant believers who were nevertheless hostile to the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer". John Knox took "The Form of Prayers" with him to Scotland, where it formed the basis of the Scottish "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Common%20Order">pageRank.Book of Common Order</a>".

Under <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, a more permanent enforcement of the reformed Church of England was undertaken and the 1552 book was republished, scarcely altered, in 1559 .

The alterations, though minor, were however to cast a long shadow in the development of the Church of England. One, the "<a href="Ornaments%20Rubric">Ornaments Rubric</a>", related to what clergy were to wear while conducting services. Instead of the banning of all vestments except the rochet for bishops and the <a href="surplice">surplice</a> for parish clergy, it permitted "such ornaments...as were in use...in the second year of K. Edward VI". This allowed substantial leeway for more traditionalist clergy to retain some of the vestments which they felt were appropriate to liturgical celebration (at least until the Queen gave further instructions under the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity">Act of Uniformity</a> of 1559). It was to be the basis of claims in the 19th century that vestments such as chasubles, albs and stoles were legal. At Holy Communion, the words from the 1549 book, "the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ" etc. were combined with the words of Edward's second book, "Take eat in remembrance" "suggesting on the one hand a real presence to those who wished to find it and on the other, the communion as memorial only", i.e. an objective presence and subjective reception. The instruction to the congregation to kneel when receiving communion was retained; but the <a href="Black%20Rubric">Black Rubric</a> )#29 in the Forty-Two Articles of Faith which were reduced to 39) which denied any "real and essential presence" of Christ's flesh and blood, was removed to "conciliate traditionalists" and aligned with Queen's sensibilities, . The removal of the Black Rubric complements the dual words of administration of communion and permits an action, kneeling to receive, which people were used to doing. The Prayer pageRank.Book "...was a masterpiece of theological engineering," (arv.. The doctrines in the Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion would set the tone of Anglicanism which would prefer to steer a Middle Way between Roman Catholicism and radical forms of Protestantism, and avoid being identified as a Confessional Church like Calvinists and Lutherans. The conservative nature of these changes underlines the fact that reformed principles were by no means universally popular – a fact that the Queen recognised: her revived <a href="Act%20of%20Supremacy">Act of Supremacy</a>, giving her the ambiguous title of <a href="Supreme%20Governor">Supreme Governor</a>, passed without difficulty but the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201559">Act of Uniformity 1559</a>, giving statutory force to the Prayer pageRank.Book, passed through the House of Lords by only three votes. It made constitutional history in being imposed by the laity alone, as all the bishops, except those imprisoned by the Queen and unable to attend, voted against it . Convocation had made its position clear by affirming the traditional doctrine of the Eucharist, the authority of the Pope, and the reservation by divine law to clergy "of handling and defining concerning the things belonging to faith, sacraments, and discipline ecclesiastical" .

After the several innovations and reversals, the new forms of worship took time to settle in. Among Cranmer's innovations, retained in the new book was the requirement of weekly Holy Communion services. In practice, as before the English Reformation, many received communion rarely, as little as once a year in some cases; <a href="George%20Herbert">George Herbert</a> estimated it as no more than six times. . Practice, however, varied from place to place: very high attendance at festivals was the order of the day in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular, in other places families stayed away or sent "a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household." . Few parish clergy were initially licensed to preach by the bishops; in the absence of a licensed preacher, Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Homilies">homilies</a> written by Cranmer . George Herbert was, however, not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching, which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest . Music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between, on the one hand, parish worship where only the <a href="metrical%20psalms">metrical psalms</a> of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung and, on the other hand, worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations, where the music of <a href="John%20Marbeck">John Marbeck</a> and others was developed into a rich choral tradition . The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours; and accordingly, churches were equipped with <a href="pew">pew</a>s in which households could sit together (whereas in the medieval church, men and women had worshipped separately). Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as, "a morning marathon of prayer, scripture reading, and praise, consisting of mattins, litany, and ante-communion, preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week." .

Many ordinary churchgoers—that is those who could afford a copy as it was expensive—would own a copy of the prayer book. Judith Maltby cites a story of parishioners at Flixton in Suffolk who brought their own prayer books to church in order to shame their vicar into conforming with it: they eventually ousted him . Between 1549 and 1642, roughly 290 editions of the prayer book were produced . Before the end of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> (1642-1651) and the introduction of the 1662 prayer book, something like a half a million prayer books are estimated to have been in circulation .

A (re)translation into Latin of the 1559 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer was made in the form of <a href="Walter%20Haddon">Walter Haddon</a>'s "Liber Precum Publicarum" of 1560. Its use was destined for the universities.

On Elizabeth's death in 1603, the 1559 book, substantially that of 1552 which had been regarded as offensive by some, such as Bishop <a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a>, as being a break with the tradition of the Western Church, had come to be regarded in some quarters as unduly Catholic. On his accession and following the so-called "<a href="Millenary%20Petition">Millenary Petition</a>", <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> called the <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Conference">Hampton Court Conference</a> in 1604—the same meeting of bishops and Puritan divines that initiated the <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">Authorized King James Version</a> of the Bible. This was in effect a series of two conferences: (i) between James and the bishops; (ii) between James and the Puritans on the following day. The Puritans raised four areas of concern: purity of doctrine; the means of maintaining it; church government; and the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer". Here Confirmation, the cross in baptism, private baptism, the use of the surplice, kneeling for communion, reading the "Apocrypha"; and subscription to the BCP and Articles were all touched on. On the third day, after James had received a report back from the bishops and made final modifications, he announced his decisions to the Puritans and bishops.

The business of making the changes was then entrusted to a small committee of bishops and the Privy Council and, apart from tidying up details, this committee introduced into Morning and Evening Prayer a prayer for the Royal Family; added several thanksgivings to the Occasional Prayers at the end of the Litany; altered the rubrics of Private Baptism limiting it to the minister of the parish, or some other lawful minister, but still allowing it in private houses (the Puritans had wanted it only in the church); and added to the Catechism the section on the sacraments. The changes were put into effect by means of an explanation issued by James in the exercise of his prerogative under the terms of the 1559 Act of Uniformity and Act of Supremacy. 

The accession of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> (1625–1649) brought about a complete change in the religious scene in that the new king used his supremacy over the established church "to promote his own idiosyncratic style of sacramental Kingship" which was "a very weird aberration from the first hundred years of the early reformed Church of England". He questioned "the populist and parliamentary basis of the Reformation Church" and unsettled to a great extent "the consensual accommodation of Anglicanism" and this led to the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and republican <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a>.

With the defeat of Charles I (1625–1649) in the Civil War, the Puritan pressure, exercised through a much-changed Parliament, had increased. Puritan-inspired petitions for the removal of the prayer book and episcopacy "<a href="Root%20and%20Branch">root and branch</a>" resulted in local disquiet in many places and, eventually, the production of locally organized counter petitions. The parliamentary government had its way but it became clear that the division was not between Catholics and Protestants, but between Puritans and those who valued the Elizabethan settlement. . The 1604 book was finally outlawed by Parliament in 1645 to be replaced by the <a href="Directory%20of%20Public%20Worship">Directory of Public Worship</a>, which was more a set of instructions than a prayer book. How widely the Directory was used is not certain; there is some evidence of its having been purchased, in churchwardens' accounts, but not widely. The Prayer pageRank.Book certainly was used clandestinely in some places, not least because the Directory made no provision at all for burial services. Following the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the establishment of the Commonwealth under Lord Protector <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Cromwell</a>, it would not be reinstated until shortly after the restoration of the monarchy to England.

<a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> records, in "<a href="John%20Evelyn%27s%20Diary">Diary</a>", receiving communion according to the 1604 Prayer pageRank.Book rite:

In 1557, the Scots Protestant lords had adopted the English Prayer pageRank.Book of 1552, for <a href="reformed%20worship">reformed worship</a> in Scotland. However, when <a href="John%20Knox">John Knox</a> returned to Scotland in 1559, he continued to use the "Form of Prayer" he had created for the English exiles in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> and, in 1564, this supplanted the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" under the title of the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Common%20Order">pageRank.Book of Common Order</a>".

Following the accession of King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James VI of Scotland</a> to the throne of England his son, King <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a>, with the assistance of Archbishop Laud, sought to impose the prayer book on Scotland . The book concerned was not, however, the 1559 book but very much that of 1549, the first book of Edward VI. First used in 1637, it was never accepted, having been <a href="Jenny%20Geddes">violently rejected</a> by the Scots. Following the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a> (including the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>), the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> was re-established on a <a href="presbyterianism">presbyterian</a> basis but by the Act of Comprehension 1690, the rump of <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Episcopalians</a> were allowed to hold onto their <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s. For liturgy they looked to Laud's book and in 1724 the first of the "wee bookies" was published, containing, for the sake of economy, the central part of the Communion liturgy beginning with the offertory .

Between then and 1764, when a more formal revised version was published, a number of things happened which were to separate the Scottish Episcopal liturgy more firmly from either the English books of 1549 or 1559. First, informal changes were made to the order of the various parts of the service and inserting words indicating a sacrificial intent to the Eucharist clearly evident in the words,"we thy humble servants do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty with these thy holy gifts which we now OFFER unto thee, the memorial thy Son has commandeth us to make;" secondly, as a result of Bishop Rattray's researches into the liturgies of St James and St Clement, published in 1744, the form of the invocation was changed. These changes were incorporated into the 1764 book which was to be the liturgy of the <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> (until 1911 when it was revised) but it was to influence the liturgy of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church in the United States</a>. A completely new revision was finished in 1929 and several alternative orders of the Communion service and other services have been prepared since then.

The 1662 Prayer pageRank.Book was printed only two years after the restoration of the monarchy, following the <a href="Savoy%20Conference">Savoy Conference</a> between representative <a href="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a> and twelve bishops which was convened by Royal Warrant to "advise upon and review the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer"" . Attempts by the Presbyterians, led by <a href="Richard%20Baxter">Richard Baxter</a>, to gain approval for an alternative service book failed. Their major objections (exceptions) were: firstly, that it was improper for lay people to take any vocal part in prayer (as in the Litany or Lord's Prayer), other than to say "amen"; secondly, that no set prayer should exclude the option of an extempore alternative from the minister; thirdly, that the minister should have the option to omit part of the set liturgy at his discretion; fourthly, that short <a href="collect">collect</a>s should be replaced by longer prayers and exhortations; and fifthly, that all surviving "Catholic" ceremonial should be removed.
The Savoy Conference ended in disagreement late in July 1661, but the initiative in prayer book revision had already passed to the <a href="Convocation%20of%20the%20English%20Clergy">Convocations</a> and from there to Parliament. The Convocations made some 600 changes, mostly of details, which were "far from partisan or extreme". However, Edwards states that more of the changes suggested by high Anglicans were implemented (though by no means all ) and Spurr comments that (except in the case of the Ordinal) the suggestions of the "Laudians" (<a href="John%20Cosin">Cosin</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Wren">Matthew Wren</a>) were not taken up possibly due to the influence of moderates such as Sanderson and Reynolds. For example, the inclusion in the intercessions of the Communion rite of prayer for the dead was proposed and rejected. The introduction of "Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth" remained unaltered and only a thanksgiving for those "departed this life in thy faith and fear" was inserted to introduce the petition that the congregation might be "given grace so to follow their good examples that with them we may be partakers of thy heavenly kingdom". Griffith Thomas commented that the retention of the words "militant here in earth" defines the scope of this petition: we pray for ourselves, we thank God for them, and adduces collateral evidence to this end. Secondly, an attempt was made to restore the <a href="Offertory">Offertory</a>. This was achieved by the insertion of the words "and oblations" into the prayer for the Church and the revision of the rubric so as to require the monetary offerings to be brought to the table (instead of being put in the poor box) and the bread and wine placed upon the table. Previously it had not been clear when and how bread and wine got onto the altar. The so-called "manual acts", whereby the priest took the bread and the cup during the prayer of consecration, which had been deleted in 1552, were restored; and an "amen" was inserted after the words of institution and before communion, hence separating the connections between consecration and communion which Cranmer had tried to make. After communion, the unused but consecrated bread and wine were to be reverently consumed in church rather than being taken away for the priest's own use. By such subtle means were Cranmer's purposes further confused, leaving it for generations to argue over the precise theology of the rite. One change made that constituted a concession to the Presbyterian Exceptions, was the updating and re-insertion of the so-called "<a href="Black%20Rubric">Black Rubric</a>", which had been removed in 1559. This now declared that kneeling in order to receive communion did not imply adoration of the species of the Eucharist nor "to any Corporal Presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood"—which, according to the rubric, were in heaven, not here.

Unable to accept the new book, 936 ministers were deprived. (: ) In effect, the 1662 Prayer pageRank.Book marked the end of a period of just over 100 years, when a common form of liturgy served for almost all reformed public worship in England and the start of the continuing division between <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>s and <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a>s. The actual language of the 1662 revision was little changed from that of Cranmer. With two exceptions, some words and phrases which had become archaic were modernised; secondly, the readings for the <a href="epistle">epistle</a> and <a href="gospel">gospel</a> at Holy Communion, which had been set out in full since 1549, were now set to the text of the 1611 Authorized King James Version of the Bible. The <a href="Psalter">Psalter</a>, which had not been printed in the 1549, 1552 or 1559 books—was in 1662 provided in <a href="Miles%20Coverdale">Miles Coverdale</a>'s translation from the <a href="Great%20Bible">Great Bible</a> of 1538.

It was this edition which was to be the official "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" during the growth of the British Empire and, as a result, has been a great influence on the prayer books of Anglican churches worldwide, <a href="Liturgy">liturgies</a> of other denominations in English, and of the English people and language as a whole.

Between 1662 and the 19th century, further attempts to revise the "pageRank.Book" in England stalled . On the death of Charles II, his brother James, a Roman Catholic, became <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>. James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith, whose practices were still banned. This, however, drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery'; talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air. But with the flight of James in 1688 and the arrival of the Calvinist <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William of Orange</a> the position of the parties changed. The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without, therefore, their having to submit to the Church of England, even with a liturgy more acceptable to them. They were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical. <a href="John%20Tillotson">John Tillotson</a>, Dean of Canterbury pressed the king to set up a commission to produce such a revision . The so-called "Liturgy of Comprehension" of 1689, which was the result, conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of 1661; but, when it came to <a href="convocation">convocation</a> the members, now more fearful of William's perceived agenda, did not even discuss it and its contents were, for a long time, not even accessible . This work, however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies.

By the 19th century, pressures to revise the 1662 book were increasing. Adherents of the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, begun in 1833, raised questions about the relationship of the Church of England to the apostolic church and thus about its forms of worship. Known as <a href="Tractarians">Tractarians</a> after their production of "<a href="Tracts%20for%20the%20Times">Tracts for the Times</a>" on theological issues, they advanced the case for the Church of England being essentially a part of the "Western Church", of which the Roman Catholic Church was the chief representative. The illegal use of elements of the Roman rite, the use of candles, vestments and incense – practices collectively known as <a href="Ritualism%20in%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Ritualism</a> – had become widespread and led to the establishment of a new system of discipline, intending to bring the "Romanisers" into conformity, through the <a href="Public%20Worship%20Regulation%20Act%201874">Public Worship Regulation Act 1874</a> . The Act had no effect on illegal practices: five clergy were imprisoned for contempt of court and after the trial of the much loved Bishop <a href="Edward%20King%20%28English%20bishop%29">Edward King</a> of Lincoln, it became clear that some revision of the liturgy had to be embarked upon .

One branch of the Ritualism movement argued that both "Romanisers" and their Evangelical opponents, by imitating, respectively, the Church of Rome and Reformed churches, transgressed the Ornaments Rubric of 1559 ("...that such Ornaments of the Church, and of the Ministers thereof, at all Times of their Ministration, shall be retained, and be in use, as were in this Church of England, by the Authority of Parliament, in the Second Year of the Reign of King Edward the Sixth"). These adherents of ritualism, among whom were <a href="Percy%20Dearmer">Percy Dearmer</a> and others, claimed that the Ornaments Rubric prescribed the ritual usages of the <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a> with the exception of a few minor things already abolished by the early reformation.

Following a Royal Commission report in 1906, work began on a new prayer book. It took twenty years to complete, prolonged partly due to the demands of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and partly in the light of the 1920 constitution of the Church Assembly, which "perhaps not unnaturally wished to do the work all over again for itself" .

In 1927, the work on a new version of the prayer book reached its final form. In order to reduce conflict with traditionalists, it was decided that the form of service to be used would be determined by each congregation. With these open guidelines, the book was granted approval by the Church of England Convocations and Church Assembly in July 1927. Since the <a href="Church%20of%20England%20Assembly%20%28Powers%29%20Act%201919">Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919</a> required measures affecting the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" to be approved by Parliament before receiving royal assent, the measure authorising its use, together with an annexed copy (a "Deposited pageRank.Book"), was submitted to Parliament. The House of Lords approved the "pageRank.Book" by a large majority, but the corresponding resolution in the House of Commons was defeated by thirty-three votes on 15 December 1927 when the MPs <a href="William%20Joynson-Hicks%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Brentford">William Joynson-Hicks</a> and Rosslyn Mitchell "reached and inflamed all the latent Protestant prejudices in the House" and argued strongly against it on the grounds that the proposed book was "papistical", restored the Roman Mass and implied the doctrine of transubstantiation.

Early in 1928, a second measure, the Prayer pageRank.Book Measure 1928, was introduced in the Church Assembly proposing to authorise the use of the "Deposited pageRank.Book" with certain amendments which were set out in a schedule to the Measure. This Measure again was approved by large majorities in both the Convocations and the Church Assembly; but again failed to pass the House of Commons, being defeated by forty-six votes on 14 June 1928. Writing in 1947, Cyril Garbett comments:"The House of Commons was within its constitutional rights in rejecting in a few hours the work of many anxious years. Nonconformist members and members from constituencies which would not have been affected by the Revised pageRank.Book were only exercising their full legal rights in throwing out a Measure which was approved by the majority of English Members of Parliament. But whatever were the reasons behind the votes of the majority, the rejection of the Measures made it plain that the Church does not possess full spiritual freedom to determine its worship ..." Stephen Neill points out that the Roman Catholic members of parliament abstained from voting.

In response to this rejection, the bishops issued a unanimous statement, asserting the Church of England's right to order its forms of worship and, in 1929, the Upper House of the <a href="Convocation%20of%20Canterbury">Convocation of Canterbury</a> resolved that bishops might approve the use of the 1928 book, notwithstanding the lack of parliamentary authority. It became common for prayer books to be printed with the 1662 and 1928 forms of service in parallel columns, although the legal basis of the revision remained unclear. The 1928 revised forms of Matrimony and Baptism were quite widely adopted, but those of other rites tended not to be; the consequence, in practice, being very wide variation in liturgical practice from parish to parish, with very few clergy adhering consistently to the strict observation of either the 1662 or the 1928 forms of worship.

The effect of the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further attempts were made to revise the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer". Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led to the publication of Series 1, 2 and 3 in the 1960s, the 1980 <a href="Alternative%20Service%20Book">Alternative Service pageRank.Book</a> and subsequently to the 2000 "<a href="Common%20Worship">Common Worship</a>" series of books. Both differ substantially from the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer," though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service, largely along the lines proposed for the 1928 Prayer pageRank.Book. Order One follows the pattern of modern liturgical scholarship.

With British colonial expansion from the 17th century onwards, Anglicanism spread across the globe. The new Anglican churches used and revised the use of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer", until they, like the English church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries which come under the general heading of the <a href="Liturgical%20Movement">Liturgical Movement</a>.

In South Africa a "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" was "Set Forth by Authority for Use in the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Province%20of%20South%20Africa">Church of the Province of South Africa</a>" in 1954. This prayerbook is still in use in some churches Southern Africa, however it has been largely replaced by "An Anglican Prayerbook -1989" and its translations to the other languages in use in Southern Africa.

The "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" is translated literally as in <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> (<a href="Standard%20Mandarin">Mandarin</a>: "Gōng dǎo shū"; <a href="Standard%20Cantonese">Cantonese</a>: "Gūng tóu syū"). The former dioceses in the now defunct <a href="Chung%20Hua%20Sheng%20Kung%20Hui">Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui</a> had their own pageRank.Book of Common Prayer. The General Synod and the College of Bishops of Chung Hwa Sheng Kung Hui planned to publish a unified version for the use of all Anglican churches in China in 1949, which was the 400th anniversary of the first publishing of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer". After the communists took over mainland China, the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Hong%20Kong%20and%20Macao">Diocese of Hong Kong and Macao</a> became independent of the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui, and continued to use the edition issued in Shanghai in 1938 with a revision in 1959. This edition, also called the "Black-Cover pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" 黑皮公禱書 because of its black cover, still remains in use after the establishment of the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Sheng%20Kung%20Hui">Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui</a> (Anglican province in Hong Kong). The language style of "Black-Cover pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" is closer to <a href="Classical%20Chinese">Classical Chinese</a> than contemporary Chinese.

The <a href="Church%20of%20South%20India">Church of South India</a> was the first modern Episcopal uniting church, consisting as it did, from its foundation in 1947, at the time of Indian independence, of Anglicans, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Reformed Christians. Its liturgy, from the first, combined the free use of Cranmer's language with an adherence to the principles of congregational participation and the centrality of the Eucharist, much in line with the Liturgical Movement. Because it was a minority church of widely differing traditions in a non-Christian culture (except in <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, where Christianity has a long history), practice varied wildly.

The BCP is called "Kitōsho" () in Japanese. The initial effort to compile such a book in Japanese goes back to 1859 when the <a href="Christian%20mission">missionary societies</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> and of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20of%20the%20United%20States">Episcopal Church of the United States</a> started their work in Japan, later joined by the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a> in 1888. PIn 1879, the "Seikōkwai Tō Bun" (), Anglican Prayer Texts) were prepared in Japanese As the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20in%20Japan">Anglican Church in Japan</a> was established in 1887, the <a href="Romanization%20of%20Japanese">Romanized</a> "Nippon Seikōkwai Kitō Bun" () were compiled in 1879. There was a major revision of these texts and the first "Kitōsho" was born in 1895, which had the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharistic</a> part in both English and American traditions. There were further revisions, and the Kitōsho published in 1939 was the last revision that was done before the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, still using the <a href="Historical%20kana%20orthography">Historical kana orthography</a>. 

After the end of the War, the "Kitōsho" of 1959 became available, using <a href="Modern%20kana%20usage">post-war Japanese orthography</a>, but still in traditional <a href="classical%20Japanese%20language">classical Japanese language</a> and <a href="vertical%20writing">vertical writing</a>. In the fifty years after World War II, there were several efforts to translate the Bible into modern <a href="Colloquialism">colloquial</a> Japanese, the most recent of which was the publication in 1990 of the <a href="Japanese%20New%20Interconfessional%20Translation%20Bible">Japanese New Interconfessional Translation Bible</a>. The "Kitōsho" using the colloquial Japanese language and <a href="horizontal%20writing">horizontal writing</a> was published in the same year. It also used the <a href="Revised%20Common%20Lectionary">Revised Common Lectionary</a>. This latest "Kitōsho" since went through several minor revisions, such as employing the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a> in Japanese common with the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Japan">Catholic Church</a> () in 2000.

In 1965, the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Korea">Anglican Church of Korea</a> first published a translation of the 1662 BCP into Korean and called it "gong-dong-gi-do-mun (공동기도문)" meaning "common prayers". In 1994, the prayers announced "allowed" by the 1982 Bishops Council of the Anglican Church of Korea was published in a second version of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayers" In 2004, the National Anglican Council published the third and the current pageRank.Book of Common Prayers known as "seong-gong-hwe gi-do-seo (성공회기도서)" or the "Anglican Prayers", including the Daily Masses, Special Masses, Baptism, Confirmation, Funeral Mass, Wedding Mass, Rite of Ordination Mass, and all of the other events the Anglican Church of Korea celebrates.
The Diction of the books has changed from the 1965 version to the 2004 version. For example, the word "God" has changed from classical Chinese term "Cheon-ju (천주)" to native Korean word "ha-neu-nim (하느님)," in accordance with to the Public Christian translation, and as used in 1994 Common Translation Bible (gong-dong beon-yeok-seong-seo) that the Church currently uses.

As the Philippines is connected to the worldwide <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> through the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20Philippines">Episcopal Church in the Philippines</a>, the main edition of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" in use throughout the islands is the same as that of the United States.

Aside from the American version and the newly published Philippine pageRank.Book of Common Prayer, <a href="Filipino-Chinese">Filipino-Chinese</a> congregants of Saint Stephen's Pro-Cathedral in the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20Philippines%23Dioceses">Diocese of the Central Philippines</a> uses the English-Chinese "Diglot pageRank.Book of Common Prayer", published by the Episcopal Church of Southeast Asia.

The ECP has since published its own pageRank.Book of Common Prayer upon gaining full autonomy on 1 May 1990. This version is notable for the inclusion of the "<a href="Misa%20de%20Gallo">Misa de Gallo</a>", a popular <a href="Christmas%20in%20the%20Philippines">Christmastide</a> devotion amongst <a href="Filipino%20people">Filipinos</a> that is of <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20Philippines">Catholic</a> origin.

The first printed book in Ireland was in <a href="English%20Language">English</a>, the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer".

William Bedell had undertaken an <a href="Irish%20Language">Irish</a> translation of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664–1747) and published in 1712. "Until the 1960s, the pageRank.Book of Common Prayer, derived from 1662 with only mild tinkering, was quite simply "the" worship of the church of Ireland." The 1712 edition had parallel columns in English and Irish languages.
It has been revised several times, and the present edition has been used since 2004.

The <a href="Lusitanian%20Catholic%20Apostolic%20Evangelical%20Church">Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church</a> formed in 1880. A Portuguese language Prayer pageRank.Book is the basis of the Church's liturgy. In the early days of the church, a translation into Portuguese from 1849 of the 1662 edition of the pageRank.Book of Common Prayer was used. In 1884 the church published its own prayer book based on the Anglican, Roman and Mozarabic liturgies. The intent was to emulate the customs of the primitive apostolic church.
Newer editions of their prayer book are available in Portuguese and with an English translation.

The Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church or IERE () is the church of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. It was founded in 1880 and since 1980 has been an <a href="Extra-provincial%20Anglican%20churches">extra-provincial church</a> under the <a href="metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan authority</a> of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Previous to its organization, there were several translations of the Anglican pageRank.Book of Common Prayer into Spanish in 1623 and in 1707.

In 1881 the church combined a Spanish translation of the 1662 edition of the pageRank.Book of Common Prayer with the <a href="Mozarabic%20Rite">Mozarabic Rite</a> liturgy, which had recently been translated. This is apparently the first time the Spanish speaking Anglicans inserted their own "...historic, national tradition of liturgical worship within an Anglican prayer book." A second edition was released in 1889, and a revision in 1975. This attempt combined the Anglican structure of worship with indigenous prayer traditions.

An Act of Parliament passed in the year 1563, entitled “An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue,” ordered that the Old and New Testament, together with the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer", were to be translated into <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>. A translation by <a href="Richard%20Davies%20%28bishop%29">Richard Davies</a>, bishop of <a href="St%20David%27s">St David's</a> and the scholar <a href="William%20Salesbury">William Salesbury</a> was published in 1567 by <a href="Humphrey%20Toy">Humphrey Toy</a> as "Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin". A new revision — based on the 1662 English revision and probably by <a href="George%20Griffith%20%28bishop%29">George Griffith</a>, Bishop of <a href="St%20Asaph">St Asaph</a> - was published in 1664.

Until 1966, when trials of new services began, the 1662 book and its Welsh equivalent continued to be used, even after the <a href="Church%20in%20Wales">Church in Wales</a> was disestablished in 1920. The present version was published in 1984 and is currently under revision.

The first <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a> translation of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" was made by <a href="John%20Phillips%20%28Bishop%20of%20Sodor%20and%20Man%29">John Phillips (Bishop of Sodor and Man)</a> in 1610. A more successful "New Version" by his successor <a href="Mark%20Hiddesley">Mark Hiddesley</a> was in use until 1824 when English liturgy became universal on the island.

It includes passages in the Maori, Fijian, Tongan and English languages.

The <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a>, known officially, until 1981, as the "Church of England in Australia and Tasmania", became self-governing in 1961. Its General Synod agreed that the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" was to "be regarded as the authorised standard of worship and doctrine in this Church". In 1978, "An Australian Prayer pageRank.Book" was produced, seeking to adhere to this principle, such that where the Liturgical Committee could not agree on a formulation, the words or expressions of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" were to be used . The result was conservative revision.

"A Prayer pageRank.Book for Australia", produced in 1995, departed from both the structure and wording of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer", prompting conservative reaction. Numerous objections were made and the notably conservative evangelical <a href="Sydney%20Anglicans">Diocese of Sydney</a> drew attention to the loss of "BCP" wording and of an explicit "biblical doctrine of substitutionary atonement". The Diocese of Sydney has developed its own small prayer book, called "<a href="Sunday%20Services">Sunday Services</a>", to supplement the existing prayer book and preserve the original theology which the Sydney diocese asserts has been changed.

The <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a>, which until 1955 was known as the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada or simply the Church of England in Canada, developed its first pageRank.Book of Common Prayer separately from the English version in 1918, which received final authorization from General Synod on April 16, 1922. The revision of 1959 was much more substantial, bearing a family relationship to that of the abortive 1928 book in England. The language was conservatively modernized, and additional seasonal material was added. As in England, while many prayers were retained though the structure of the Communion service was altered: a Prayer of Oblation was added to the Eucharistic prayer after the 'words of institution', thus reflecting the rejection of Cranmer's theology in liturgical developments across the Anglican Communion. More controversially, the Psalter included in the book omitted certain sections, including the entirety of Psalm 58. (According to the <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20090903180111/http%3A//www.prayerbook.ca%3A80/bcp/psalmstables.html">Tables of Proper Psalms</a>, "The following passages in the Psalter as hitherto used are omitted: Psalm 14. 5-7; 55. 16; 58 (all); 68. 21-23; 69. 23-29; 104. 35 (in part); 109. 5-19; 136. 27; 137. 7-9; 140. 9-10; 141. 7-8. The verses are renumbered." See also the <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20090521143044/http%3A//prayerbook.ca%3A80/bcp/psalter.html">Psalter from 1962 Canadian pageRank.Book of Common Prayer</a>). General Synod gave final authorization to the revision in 1962, to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the 1662 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer. A French translation, "Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne", was published in 1967.

After a period of experimentation with the publication of various supplements, the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Alternative%20Services">pageRank.Book of Alternative Services</a>" was published in 1985. This book (which owes much to Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Anglican and other sources) has widely supplanted the 1959 book, though the latter remains authorized. As in other places, there has been a reaction and the Canadian version of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" has found supporters.

The "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" has also been translated into these North American indigenous languages: Cowitchan, Cree, Haida, Ntlakyapamuk, Slavey, Eskimo-Aleut, Dakota, Delaware, Mohawk, Ojibwe.

<a href="Joseph%20Gilfillan">Joseph Gilfillan</a> was the chief editor of the 1911 <a href="Anishinaabe%20language">Ojibwa</a> edition of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" entitled "Iu Wejibuewisi Mamawi Anamiawini Mazinaigun" ("Iw Wejibwewizi Maamawi-anami'aawini Mazina'igan") .

The <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church</a> separated itself from the Church of England in 1789, the first church in the USA having been founded in 1607. Its prayer book, published in 1790, had as its sources the 1662 English book and the 1764 Scottish Liturgy (see above) which <a href="Samuel%20Seabury%20%281729%E2%80%931796%29">Bishop Seabury</a> of Connecticut had brought over following his consecration in Aberdeen in 1784, containing elements of each . The preface to the 1789 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer says, "this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doctrine, discipline, or worship...further than local circumstances require." There were some notable differences. For example, in the Communion service the prayer of consecration follows mainly the Scottish orders derived from 1549 and found in the 1764 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer. The compilers used materials derived from ancient liturgies especially Eastern Orthodox ones such as the Liturgy of St. James. An <a href="epiclesis">epiclesis</a> was included, as in the Scottish book, though modified to meet reformist objections. Overall, the book was modelled on the English Prayer pageRank.Book, the Convention having resisted attempts at deletion and revision. The 1789 American BCP reintroduced explicit sacrificial language in the Prayer of Consecration by adding the words "which we now offer unto Thee", after "with these thy holy gifts" from the 1549 BCP. The insertion undid Cranmer's rejection of the Eucharist as a material sacrifice by which the Church offers itself to God in an unbloody liturgical representation in and with the very same sacrifice of Christ who is both priest and victim, both offering and offered. This reworking thereby aligned the church's eucharistic theology more closely to that of the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches.

Further revisions occurred in 1892 and 1928, in which minor changes were made, removing, for instance, some of <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Cranmer</a>'s Exhortations and introducing such innovations as prayers for the dead.

In 1979, a more substantial revision was made. There were now two rites for the most common services, the first that kept most of the language of 1928, and the second using only contemporary language (some of it newly composed, and some adapted from the older language). Many changes were made in the rubrics and the shapes of the services, which were generally made for both the traditional and contemporary language versions. However, there was arguably a greater degree of continuity than was the case in England, which may account for the fact that all the books of the series, from 1790 to 1979 retain the same title. The 1979 book owes a good deal to the <a href="Liturgical%20Movement">Liturgical Movement</a> and to the 19th-century <a href="Catholic%20revival">Catholic revival</a>. Many traditionalists, both <a href="Anglo-Catholics">Anglo-Catholics</a> and <a href="Evangelicals">Evangelicals</a>, felt alienated by the theological changes made in the 1979 BCP, and in 1991 The Church of the Good Shepherd in Rosemont, PA published a book entitled, the "<a href="Anglican%20Service%20Book">Anglican Service pageRank.Book</a>" which is "a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions." Books like this are allowed in the Episcopal Church because of a rubric in the 1979 Prayer pageRank.Book which allows for the translation of the contemporary language into the traditional language of the 1928 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer.

Even so, the revision caused some controversy and in 2000, the <a href="General%20Convention%20of%20the%20Episcopal%20Church">General Convention of the Episcopal Church</a> issued an apology to those "offended or alienated during the time of liturgical transition to the 1979 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer." Use of the 1928 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer is currently discouraged. Article X of the Canons of the Episcopal Church provides that "[t]he pageRank.Book of Common Prayer, as now established or hereafter amended by the authority of this Church, shall be in use in all the Dioceses of this Church," which, of course, is a reference to the 1979 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer.

The Prayer pageRank.Book Cross was erected in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a> in 1894 as a gift from the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Created by <a href="Ernest%20Coxhead">Ernest Coxhead</a>, it stands on one of the higher points in Golden Gate Park. It is located between John F. Kennedy Drive and Park Presidio Drive, near Cross Over Drive. This sandstone cross commemorates the first use of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" in California by Sir <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>'s chaplain on June 24, 1579.

In 2003, a Roman Catholic liturgical book, the "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Divine%20Worship">pageRank.Book of Divine Worship</a>", was published in the United States. The book's development began in the early 1980s for former Anglicans within the <a href="Anglican%20Use">Anglican Use</a> parishes. It was published in a single volume, primarily for their own use, in 2003. The book is composed of material drawn from the proposed 1928 BCP, the 1979 "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Missal">Roman Missal</a>. Since 2011, the "pageRank.Book of Divine Worship" has undergone additional revision to bring it more coherently in line with the language of the BCP, while also incorporating elements of the English Missal and the Anglican Missal. The updated edition was mandated for use in all <a href="personal%20ordinariate">personal ordinariate</a>s for former Anglicans from Advent 2013, although further revision is expected to incorporate most of the BCP propers as well.

The "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" has had a great influence on a number of other denominations. While theologically different, the language and flow of the service of many other churches owe a great debt to the prayer book. In particular, many Christian prayer books have drawn on the <a href="Collect">Collect</a>s for the Sundays of the Church Year—mostly freely translated or even "rethought" by Cranmer from a wide range of Christian traditions, but including a number of original compositions—which are widely recognized as masterpieces of compressed liturgical construction.

<a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, an Anglican priest whose revivalist preaching led to the creation of <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> wrote in his preface to "The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America" (1784), "I believe there is no Liturgy in the world, either in ancient or modern language, which breathes more of a solid, scriptural, rational piety than the Common Prayer of the Church of England." cited in Many Methodist churches in England and the United States continued to use a slightly revised version of the book for communion services well into the 20th century. In the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>, the liturgy for Eucharistic celebrations is almost identical to what is found in the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer", as are some of the other liturgies and services.

A unique variant was developed in 1785 in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> when the historic <a href="King%27s%20Chapel">King's Chapel</a> (founded 1686) left the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> and became an independent <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian church</a>. To this day, King's Chapel uniquely uses "The pageRank.Book of Common Prayer According to the Use in King's Chapel" in its worship.

Together with the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of the Bible and the works of <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" has been one of the three fundamental underpinnings of modern English. As it has been in regular use for centuries, many phrases from its services have passed into everyday English, either as deliberate quotations or as unconscious borrowings. They have often been used metaphorically in non-religious contexts, and authors have used phrases from the prayer book as titles for their books.
Some examples of well-known phrases from the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" are:
References and allusions to Prayer pageRank.Book services in the works of Shakespeare were tracked down and identified by Richmond Noble . Derision of the Prayer pageRank.Book or its contents "in any interludes, plays, songs, rhymes, or by other open words" was a criminal offence under the 1559 <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201559">Act of Uniformity</a>, and consequently Shakespeare avoids too direct reference; but Noble particularly identifies the reading of the Psalter according to the <a href="Great%20Bible">Great Bible</a> version specified in the Prayer pageRank.Book, as the biblical book generating the largest number of <a href="Biblical%20allusions%20in%20Shakespeare">Biblical references</a> in Shakespeare's plays. Noble found a total of 157 allusions to the Psalms in the plays of the <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a>, relating to 62 separate Psalms—all, save one, of which he linked to the version in the Psalter, rather than those in the <a href="Geneva%20Bible">Geneva Bible</a> or <a href="Bishops%27%20Bible">Bishops' Bible</a>. In addition, there are a small number of direct allusions to liturgical texts in the Prayer pageRank.Book; e.g. Henry VIII 3:2 where Wolsey states "Vain Pomp and Glory of this World, I hate ye!", a clear reference to the rite of Public Baptism; where the Godparents are asked "Doest thou forsake the vaine pompe and glory of the worlde..?"

As novelist <a href="P.%20D.%20James">P. D. James</a> observed, "We can recognize the Prayer pageRank.Book’s cadences in the works of <a href="Isaac%20Walton">Isaac Walton</a> and <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>, in the majestic phrases of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>, <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Browne">Sir Thomas Browne</a> and <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a>. We can see its echo in the works of such very different writers as <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, the <a href="Bront%C3%AB%20family">Brontës</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a>, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> and even <a href="Dorothy%20L.%20Sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>." James herself used phrases from the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" and made them into bestselling titles – "<a href="Devices%20and%20Desires">Devices and Desires</a>" and "<a href="The%20Children%20of%20Men">The Children of Men</a>" – while <a href="Alfonso%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Alfonso Cuarón</a>'s 2006 film "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>" placed the phrase onto cinema marquees worldwide.

In England there are only three bodies entitled to print the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer": the two <a href="privileged%20presses">privileged presses</a> (<a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a> and <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>), and The <a href="Queen%27s%20Printer">Queen's Printer</a>. Cambridge University Press holds <a href="Letters%20Patent">Letters Patent</a> as The Queen's Printer and so two of these three bodies are the same. The Latin term "" ("with privilege") is printed on the title pages of Cambridge editions of the 1662 pageRank.Book of Common Prayer (and the King James Version of the Bible) to denote the charter authority or privilege under which they are published.

The primary function for Cambridge University Press in its role as Queen’s Printer is preserving the integrity of the text, continuing a long-standing tradition and reputation for textual scholarship and accuracy of printing. Cambridge University Press has stated that as a university press, a charitable enterprise devoted to the advancement of learning, it has no desire to restrict artificially that advancement, and that commercial restrictiveness through a partial monopoly is not part of its purpose. It therefore grants permission to use the text, and license printing or the importation for sale within the UK, as long as it is assured of acceptable quality and accuracy.

The Church of England, supported by the <a href="Prayer%20Book%20Society%20%28England%29">Prayer pageRank.Book Society</a>, publishes an online edition of the pageRank.Book of Common Prayer with permission of Cambridge University Press.

In accordance with Canon II.3.6(b)(2) of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church (United States)</a>, the church relinquishes any copyright for the version of the "pageRank.Book of Common Prayer" currently adopted by the Convention of the church (although the text of proposed revisions remains copyrighted).

Bokken

A bokken (, "bok(u)", "wood", and "ken", "sword") (or a "bokutō" , as they are instead called in Japan) is a <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese <a href="waster">wooden sword</a> used for training. It is usually the size and shape of a "<a href="katana">katana</a>", but is sometimes shaped like other <a href="sword">sword</a>s, such as the "<a href="wakizashi">wakizashi</a>" and "<a href="tant%C5%8D">tantō</a>". Some ornamental bokken are decorated with mother-of-pearl work and elaborate carvings. Sometimes it is spelled "boken" in English.
"Bokken" should not be confused with "<a href="shinai">shinai</a>", practice swords made of flexible bamboo.

"Bokken" were designed to lessen the damage caused by fighting with real swords and were used for the training of <a href="samurai">samurai</a> warriors in feudal Japan. Bokken eventually became lethal weapons themselves in the hands of trained experts.

<a href="Miyamoto%20Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a>, a <a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a> master, was renowned for fighting fully armed foes with only one or two bokken. In a famous legend, he defeated <a href="Sasaki%20Kojir%C5%8D">Sasaki Kojiro</a> with a bokken he had carved from an <a href="oar">oar</a> while traveling on a boat to the <a href="Ganry%C5%ABjima">predetermined island</a> for the duel.

The "bokken" is used as an inexpensive and relatively safe substitute for a real sword in several <a href="martial%20arts">martial arts</a> such as "<a href="aikido">aikido</a>", "<a href="kendo">kendo</a>", "<a href="iaido">iaido</a>", "<a href="kenjutsu">kenjutsu</a>" and "<a href="jodo">jodo</a>". Its simple wooden construction demands less care and maintenance than a katana. In addition, training with a bokken does not carry the same mortal risk associated with that of a sharp metal sword, both for the user and other practitioners nearby. While its use has several advantages over use of a live edged weapon, it can still be deadly, and any training with a bokken should be done with due care. Injuries occurring from bokken are very similar to those caused by clubs and similar battering weapons and include compound fractures, ruptured organs, and other such blunt force injuries. In some ways, a bokken can be more dangerous as the injuries caused are often unseen and inexperienced practitioners may underestimate the risk of harm. It is not a sparring weapon, but is intended to be used in <a href="kata">kata</a> and to acclimate the student to the feel of a real sword. For sparring, a bamboo <a href="shinai">shinai</a> is typically used instead for obvious safety reasons.

In 2003, the <a href="All%20Japan%20Kendo%20Federation">All Japan Kendo Federation</a> (AJKF) introduced a set of basic exercises using a "bokuto" called "Bokuto Ni Yoru Kendo Kihon-waza Keiko-ho". This form of practice is intended primarily for kendo practitioners up to <a href="Dan%20%28rank%29%23Ranks%20in%20Japanese">Nidan</a> ranking, but can be beneficial for all kendo students.

"<a href="Suburito">Suburito</a>" are "bokken" designed for use in "<a href="suburi">suburi</a>". "Suburi", literally "bare swinging," are solo cutting exercises. Suburito are thicker and heavier than normal "bokken" and users of suburito must therefore develop both strength and technique. Their weight makes them unsuitable for paired practice and solo forms. One famous user of the suburi-sized bokken is <a href="Miyamoto%20Musashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a> who used one in his duel against <a href="Sasaki%20Kojiro">Sasaki Kojiro</a>.

As late as 2015, bokken were issued to the Los Angeles Police Mounted Unit for use as batons.

Bokken can be made to represent any style of weapon required such as <a href="nagamaki">nagamaki</a>, <a href="Nodachi">no-dachi</a>, <a href="yari">yari</a>, <a href="naginata">naginata</a>, <a href="kama%20%28weapon%29">kama</a>, etc. The most widely used styles are:


Additionally, various <a href="koryu">koryu</a> (traditional Japanese martial arts) have their own distinct styles of bokken which can vary slightly in length, tip shape, or in whether or not a tsuba (hilt guard) is added.

The <a href="All%20Japan%20Kendo%20Federation">All Japan Kendo Federation</a> specify the dimensions of "bokken" for use in the modern kendo kata, called "Nippon kendo kata".

Bokken are depicted in film, manga, anime, and comic books.

Birmingham Small Arms Company

The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA) was a major British industrial combine, a group of businesses manufacturing military and sporting firearms; bicycles; motorcycles; cars; buses and bodies; steel; iron castings; <a href="hand%20tool">hand</a>, <a href="power%20tool">power</a>, and <a href="machine%20tool">machine</a> tools; coal cleaning and handling plants; sintered metals; and hard chrome process.

At its peak, BSA (who also owned <a href="Triumph%20Engineering%20Co%20Ltd">Triumph</a>) was the largest motorcycle producer in the world. In the late 1950s and early 1960s poor management and failure to develop new products in the motorcycle division led to a dramatic decline of sales to its major USA market. The management had failed to appreciate the importance of the resurgent Japanese motorcycle industry, leading to problems for the entire BSA group.

A government-organised rescue operation in 1973 led to the takeover of remaining operations by what is now <a href="Manganese%20Bronze%20Holdings">Manganese Bronze Holdings</a>, then owners of <a href="Norton-Villiers">Norton-Villiers</a>, and over the following decade further closures and dispersals. The original company, The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited, remains a subsidiary of Manganese Bronze but its name was changed in 1987.

Manganese Bronze continues to operate former BSA subsidiary <a href="Carbodies">Carbodies</a>, now known as <a href="The%20London%20Taxi%20Company">The London Taxi Company</a>, previously LTI Limited, manufacturers of <a href="Hackney%20carriage">London taxicabs</a> and formerly the largest wholly British-owned car manufacturer. (Manganese Bronze is now owned by the Chinese company <a href="Geely">Geely</a>).

BSA began in June 1861 in the <a href="Gun%20Quarter">Gun Quarter</a>, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England, founded specifically to manufacture guns by machinery. It was formed by a group of fourteen gunsmith members of the Birmingham Small Arms Trade Association. The market had moved against British gunsmiths following the outbreak of the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in 1854 because the <a href="Board%20of%20Ordnance">Board of Ordnance</a>'s <a href="Royal%20Small%20Arms%20Factory">Royal Small Arms Factory</a> at Enfield had introduced machinery made in the USA and Enfield's greatly increased output had been achieved with reduced reliance on skilled craftsmen. The <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> provided this new grouping of gunsmiths free access to technical drawings and their facilities at their Enfield factory.

The newly formed company purchased of land at <a href="Small%20Heath%2C%20Birmingham">Small Heath, Birmingham</a>, built a factory there and made a road on the site calling it Armoury Road.

This machinery brought to Birmingham manifested the principle of the inter-changeability of parts.

BSA's resort to the use of machinery was rewarded in 1863 with an order for 20,000 Turkish infantry rifles. The management of the BSA Company was changed at an Extraordinary Meeting called on 30 September 1863 when the company was changed from being run by a committee to that of an elected Board of Directors, Joseph Wilson, Samuel Buckley, Isaac Hollis, Charles Playfair, Charles Pryse, Sir John Ratcliffe, Edward Gem, and J.F. Swinburn under the chairmanship of John Dent Goodman.

The first War Office contract was not agreed until 1868. In 1879, the factory, without work, was shut for a year; the military arms trade was precarious.

The next year BSA branched out into bicycle manufacture. The gun factory proved remarkably adaptable to the manufacture of cycle parts. What cycles needed was large quantities of standard parts accurately machined at low prices. In 1880 BSA manufactured the <a href="http%3A//www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/TRANSPORT/diwheel/diwheel.htm">Otto Dicycle</a>, In the 1880s the company began to manufacture <a href="safety%20bicycle">safety bicycle</a>s on their own account and not until 1905 was the company's first experimental <a href="motorcycle">motorcycle</a> constructed. Bicycle production ceased in 1887 as the company concentrated on producing the <a href="Lee%E2%80%93Metford">Lee–Metford</a> magazine-loading rifle for the War Office which was re-equipping the British Army with it. The order was for 1,200 rifles per week. BSA recommenced manufacturing bicycles on their own behalf from 1908. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up in 1919 for the manufacture of both bicycles and motorcycles. BSA sold the bicycle business to <a href="Raleigh%20Bicycle%20Company">Raleigh</a> in 1957 after separating the bicycle and motorcycle business in 1953.

In 1893, BSA commenced making bicycle hubs and continued to supply the cycle trade with bicycle parts up to 1936. BSA bought The Eadie Manufacturing Company of Redditch in 1907 and so began to manufacture the Eadie two speed hub gear and the Eadie coaster brake hub. BSA also signed an agreement with the Three Speed Gear Syndicate in 1907 to manufacture a 3 speed hub under licence. This was later classified as the <a href="Sturmey%20Archer">Sturmey Archer</a> Type X. BSA introduced a 'Duo' hub in the late 1930s which was capable of one fixed gear and one gear with a freewheel. All BSA hub gear production temporarily ceased in 1939, until they recommenced making their 3 speed hub around 1945. The Eadie coaster hub made a brief return in 1953 on two BSA bicycle models. BSA forever ceased production of their hub gears in 1955.

BSA sold its ammunition business in 1897 to Birmingham Metal and Munitions Company Limited part of the Nobel-Dynamite Trust, through <a href="Kynoch">Kynoch</a> a forerunner of <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">ICI</a>.

In 1906 <a href="Dudley%20Docker">Frank Dudley Docker</a> was appointed a director of the company. By the autumn of that year BSA was in some difficulty. They had purchased the <a href="Sparkbrook">Sparkbrook</a> <a href="Royal%20Small%20Arms%20Factory">Royal Small Arms Factory</a> from the War Office, and in return, the War Office undertook to give BSA a quarter of all orders for Lee–Enfield rifles. But, the War Office did not honour their undertaking. The ensuing financial crisis did not prevent BSA from signing an agreement to amalgamate with another bicycle component manufacturer, the Eadie Manufacturing Company of <a href="Redditch">Redditch</a>, on 11 February 1907. That decision was ratified by the shareholders of both companies at separate Extraordinary General Meetings held in the Grand Hotel, Birmingham on 27 February 1907. Albert Eadie became a BSA director, a post he held until his death in 1931.

Motor bicycles were added to bicycle products in 1910. The BSA 3½ hp was exhibited at the 1910 Olympia Show, London for the 1911 season. The entire BSA production sold out in 1911, 1912 and 1913.

In an effort to make use of the Sparkbrook factory BSA established a motorcar department there. An independent part of it was occupied by <a href="Lanchester%20Motor%20Company">Lanchester Motor Company</a>. The first prototype automobile was produced in 1907. The following year, marketed under BSA Cycles Ltd, the company sold 150 automobiles and again began producing complete bicycles on its own account. By 1909 it was clear the new motorcar department was unsuccessful; an investigation committee reported to the BSA Board on the many failures of its management and their poor organisation of production.

Dudley Docker had joined the board in 1906 and was appointed deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become the leader of the period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA he started merger talks with <a href="Daimler%20Company">The Daimler Company Limited</a> of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904 Daimler's profits were 57 per cent and 150 per cent returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders was the apparent stability of BSA.

So in 1910 BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares but Docker who negotiated the arrangements either ignored or failed in his assessment of their consequences for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated. One of the financial provisions obliged Daimler to pay BSA an annual dividend of £100,000 representing approximately 40 per cent of the actual cash BSA had put into Daimler. This financial burden deprived Daimler of badly needed cash to fund development, forcing the Daimler company to borrow money from the <a href="Midland%20Bank">Midland Bank</a>.

BSA had still not recovered financially from the earlier purchase of Royal Small Arms factory at Sparkbrook and BSA were not in a position to finance Daimler, nor had either company ample liquid resources. BSA went ahead with motorcycle production in 1910, their first model available for the 1911 season. In 1913 the BSA group were compelled through pressure from the Midland Bank to make a capital issue of 300,000 preference shares. In the short term this was to solve the liquidity issue but further diluted the group's capitalisation.

Dudley Docker retired as a BSA director in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Dudley Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered and that of his 1902 merger of <a href="Metro%20Cammell">Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company</a> and <a href="Patent%20Shaft">Patent Shaft</a>. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler and in view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own using Daimler engines. In 1913 Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication that things were not well.

In 1912, BSA would be one of two automobile manufacturers pioneering the use of all-steel bodies, joining <a href="Hupmobile">Hupmobile</a> in the US.

During the First World War, the company returned to arms manufacture and greatly expanded its operations. BSA produced <a href="rifle">rifle</a>s, <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis gun</a>s, <a href="shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a>, motorcycles and other vehicles for the war effort.

In November 1919 BSA launched their first 50 degree <a href="V-twin%20engine">vee-twin</a>, <a href="BSA%20Model%20E">Model E</a>, 770cc side valve (6-7 hp) motorcycle for the 1920 season. The machine had interchangeable valves, total loss oil system with mechanical pump and an emergency hand one. Retail price was £130. Other features were <a href="Amal%20%28motorcycle%29">Amac</a> carburettor, chain drive, choice of <a href="ignition%20magneto">magneto</a> or Magdyno, 7-plate clutch, 3 speed gear box with <a href="Kick%20start">kickstarter</a> and new type of cantilever fork

During the war Daimler had built enormous numbers of aero engines and aircraft and by the end was building 80 Airco de Havilland bombers a month. In February 1920 BSA amalgamated with what was the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, <a href="Airco">Aircraft Manufacturing Company (Airco)</a>, Airco's main plant at Hendon had employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people. The Airco group of companies had turned out a new aircraft every 45 minutes.

Within days BSA discovered Airco was in a far more serious financial state than <a href="George%20Holt%20Thomas">George Holt Thomas</a> had revealed. Holt Thomas was immediately dropped from his new seat on the BSA board and all BSA's new acquisitions were placed in the hands of a liquidator. Some of the businesses were allowed to continue for some years, <a href="Aircraft%20Transport%20and%20Travel">Aircraft Transport and Travel</a>'s assets being eventually rolled into Daimler Air Hire to make <a href="Daimler%20Airway">Daimler Airway Limited</a>. BSA failed to pay a dividend for the following four years while it tried to recover from its losses. Some relief was achieved when in March 1924 Daimler Airway and its management became the major constituent of <a href="Imperial%20Airways">Imperial Airways</a>.

As well as the Daimler car range, BSA Cycles Ltd re-entered the car market under the BSA name in 1921 with a V-twin engined light car followed by four-cylinder models up to 1926, when the name was temporarily dropped. In 1929 a new range of 3- and 4-wheel cars appeared and production of these continued until 1936.

By 1930 the BSA Group's primary activities were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles.

Car production under the BSA name ceased in the 1930s.

In 1931 the <a href="Lanchester%20Motor%20Company">Lanchester Motor Company</a> at Sparkbrook was acquired and production of their cars transferred to Daimler's Coventry works. The first new product was a version of the Daimler Light Twenty or 16/20 and called Lanchester 15/18.
In the 1930s, the board of directors authorised expenditure on bringing their arms-making equipment back to use – it had been stored at company expense since the end of the Great War in the belief that BSA might again be called upon to perform its patriotic duty. In 1939, BSA acquired the blueprints for a <a href="Danuvia%2043M%20submachine%20gun">submachine gun</a> designed by Hungarian arms designer <a href="P%C3%A1l%20Kir%C3%A1ly">Pál Király</a> as well as the rights to manufacture it. Examples were produced in <a href="9mm%20Mauser%20Export">9mm Mauser Export</a> calibre according to Kiraly's design. It was estimated that these arms would only cost 5 pounds each to manufacture. However, at the time, submachine guns were viewed as "gangster weapons" and plans to manufacture it were shelved.

By the outbreak of the Second World War, BSA Guns Ltd at Small Heath, was the only factory producing rifles in the UK. The <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20Factory">Royal Ordnance Factories</a> did not begin production until 1941. BSA Guns Ltd was also producing <a href="M1919%20Browning%20machine%20gun">.303 Browning machine gun</a>s for the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> at the rate of 600 guns per week in March 1939 and Browning production was to peak at 16,390 per month by March 1942. The armed forces had chosen the 500 cc side-valve <a href="BSA%20M20">BSA M20</a> motorcycle as their preferred machine. On the outbreak of war the Government requisitioned the 690 machines BSA had in stock as well as placing an order for another 8,000 machines. South Africa, Ireland, India, Sweden and the Netherlands also wanted machines.

The Government passed the <a href="Emergency%20Powers%20%28Defence%29%20Act%201939">Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939</a> on 24 August allowing the drafting of defence regulations affecting food, travel, requisitioning of land and supplies, manpower and agricultural production. A second Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was passed on 22 May 1940 allowing the conscription of labour. The fall of France had not been anticipated in Government planning and the encirclement of a large part of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> into the Dunkirk pocket resulted in a hasty <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuation</a> of that part of the B.E.F following the abandonment of their equipment. The parlous state of affairs "no arms, no transport, no equipment" in the face of the threat of imminent invasion of Britain by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> forces was recorded by the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Imperial%20General%20Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> Field Marshal Sir <a href="Alan%20Brooke%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alanbrooke">Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke</a> in his diary entries of the 1/2 July 1940.

The creation of the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>'s broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had to step up to the mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week. Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men in all parts of the UK.

The BSA factory at Small Heath was <a href="The%20Blitz">bombed</a> by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> on 26 August 1940 resulting in one high explosive bomb and a shower of incendiaries hitting the main barrel mill which was the only one operating on service rifles in the country, causing the unaffordable loss of 750 <a href="machine%20tool">machine tool</a>s but fortunately no loss of life. Two further <a href="Birmingham%20Blitz">air raids</a> took place on 19 and 22 November 1940. The air raid of 19 November did the most damage, causing loss of production and trapping hundreds of workers. Two BSA night-shift electricians, Alf Stevens and Alf Goodwin, helped rescue their fellow workers. Alf Stevens was awarded the <a href="George%20Medal">George Medal</a> for his selfless acts of bravery in the rescue and Alf Goodwin was awarded the <a href="British%20Empire%20Medal">British Empire Medal</a>. Workers involved in the works <a href="Air%20Raid%20Precautions">Civil Defence</a> were brought in to help search for and clear bodies to get the plant back into production. The net effect of the November raids was to destroy machine shops in the four-storey 1915 building, the original 1863 gunsmiths' building and nearby buildings, 1,600 machine tools, kill 53 employees, injure 89, 30 of them seriously and halt rifle production for three months.

The Government <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> and BSA immediately began a process of production dispersal throughout Britain, through the <a href="British%20shadow%20factories">shadow factory</a> scheme. Factories were set up at <a href="Tipton">Tipton</a>, <a href="Dudley">Dudley</a>, <a href="Smethwick">Smethwick</a>, <a href="Blackheath%2C%20West%20Midlands">Blackheath</a>, <a href="Lye%2C%20West%20Midlands">Lye</a>, <a href="Kidderminster">Kidderminster</a>, <a href="Stourport-on-Severn">Stourport</a>, <a href="Tyseley">Tyseley</a>, and <a href="Bromsgrove">Bromsgrove</a> to manufacture Browning machine guns, <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke</a>, <a href="Corsham">Corsham</a>, and <a href="Newcastle-under-Lyme">Newcastle-under-Lyme</a> produced the <a href="Hispano-Suiza%20HS.404">Hispano cannon</a>, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a> and <a href="Redditch">Studley Road</a> produced the <a href="Besa%20machine%20gun">Besa machine gun</a>, <a href="Ruislip">Ruislip</a> produced the <a href="Oerlikon%2020mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20mm cannon</a>, <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a> produced <a href="RP-3">rocket projectiles</a>, <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth</a> produced <a href="Ordnance%20QF%202%20pounder">two-pounder gun carriages</a>, <a href="Mansfield">Mansfield</a> produced the <a href="Boys%20anti-tank%20rifle">Boys Anti-tank gun</a> and <a href="Solihull">Shirley</a> produced rifles. These were dispersal factories which were in addition to Small Heath and the other BSA factories opened in the two years following the 1940 blitz. At its peak Small Heath was running 67 factories engaged in war production. BSA operations were also dispersed to other companies under licence.

In 1941 BSA was approached to produce a new pedal cycle with a maximum weight allowance of only 22 lb especially for <a href="Airborne%20forces">airborne</a> use. This required a new concept in frame design which BSA found, producing a machine which weighed 21 lb, one pound less than the design specification and which also exceeded the design requirement for an effective life of 50 miles many times over. Over 60,000 <a href="folding%20bicycle">folding bicycle</a>s were produced, a figure equal to half the total production of military bicycles during World War II. BSA also produced <a href="Welbike">folding motorcycles</a> for the Airborne Division. In late 1942 BSA examined the <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> designed <a href="BSA%20Welgun">Welgun</a> with a view to manufacture. BSA were willing to manufacture the gun in the quantities required starting April 1943 but the cheaper and less accurate Sten Mk IV was adopted for production by the Ministry of Supply. BSA bought the <a href="Sunbeam%20Cycles">Sunbeam</a> motorcycles and bicycle business from <a href="Associated%20Motor%20Cycles">Associated Motor Cycles Ltd</a> in 1943 and then <a href="Ariel%20Motorcycles">Ariel Motors Ltd</a> in 1944. During the course of the conflict BSA produced 1,250,000 Lee–Enfield .303 service rifles, 404,383 <a href="Sten">Sten</a> sub-machine guns, 468,098 Browning machine guns plus spares equivalent to another 100,000, 42,532 Hispano cannon, 32,971 Oerlikon cannon, 59,322 7.9 mm Besa machine guns, 3,218 15 mm Besa machine guns, 68,882 Boys Anti-tank guns, 126,334 motorcycles, 128,000 military bicycles (over 60,000 of which were folding paratrooper bicycles), 10,000,000 shell fuse cases, 3,485,335 magazines and 750,000 anti-aircraft rockets were supplied to the armed forces.

At the same time other parts of the Group were having similar problems. Before World War II Daimler had been linked with other Coventry motor manufacturers in a government-backed scheme for aero engine manufacture and had been allocated two shadow factories. Apart from this, BSA-owned Daimler was producing <a href="Daimler%20Dingo">Scout Cars</a> and Daimler Mk I Armoured Cars which had been designed by BSA at Small Heath not Coventry as well as gun turrets, gun parts, tank transmissions, rocket projectiles and other munitions. This activity had not gone unnoticed by the enemy, which made Radford Works a target in the <a href="Coventry%20Blitz">Coventry air raids</a>. Radford Works received direct hits in four separate air raids during 1940. None of these attacks were to seriously disrupt production, however two more serious air raids were carried out in April 1941 which destroyed half the factory. In all it is estimated that 170 bombs containing 52,000 lbs of explosive were dropped on Radford Works as well as the thousands of incendiaries. Like BSA, Daimler had to find dispersal units. A back-handed compliment was paid by Field Marshal <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a> to the workers at Radford Works when he used a captured Daimler Scout to escape following his defeat at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>.

As the result of increased post war demand the <a href="Small%20Heath%2C%20Birmingham">Small Heath, Birmingham</a> factory was turned over entirely to motorcycle production.

BSA produced the first Sunbeam bicycle catalogue in 1949 and produced its own '4 Star' <a href="derailleur%20gear">derailleur gear</a> with an associated <a href="Freehub">splined cassette hub</a> and 4 sprocket cassette. This design was different from the 1930s Bayliss Wiley cassette hub which had a threaded sprocket carrier. BSA bought New Hudson motorcycle and bicycle business in 1950 and followed this up in 1951 with the purchase of <a href="Triumph%20Engineering%20Co%20Ltd">Triumph Motorcycles</a> which brought <a href="Jack%20Sangster">Jack Sangster</a> onto the BSA board. The effect of this acquisition was to make BSA into the largest producer of motorcycles in the world at that time.

1952 saw BSA establish a Professional Cycling Team. <a href="Bob%20Maitland">Bob Maitland</a> a successful amateur cyclist and the highest placed British finisher in the 1948 Olympic Games road race and now an independent rider in the BSA team was a BSA employee working in the design office as a draughtsman. It was Bob Maitland who was responsible for the design of post war BSA range of lightweight sports bicycles based on his knowledge of cycling. Bob Maitland also made some of the components used on the bicycles of the professional team which were not standard production machines. In the 1952 <a href="Tour%20of%20Britain">Tour of Britain</a> Road Race run between Friday 22 August and Saturday 6 September, involving 14 individual stages and covering a total race distance of 1,470 miles, the BSA team of Bob Maitland, “Tiny” Thomas, Pete Proctor, Alf Newman and Stan Jones won the overall team race and Pete Proctor “King of the Mountains” classification. The riders also enjoyed success on the individual stages of the race. The team competed in four further events, 14 September Tour of the Chilterns, 1st “Tiny” Thomas and Team Prize, 21 September Weston-Super-Mare Grand Prix, Team Prize, 28 September Staffordshire Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland and Team Prize, 5 October Tour Revenge Race, Dublin, 1st “Tiny” Thomas and Team prize.

In 1953 BSA withdrew motorcycle production from BSA Cycles Ltd, the company it has established in 1919, by creating BSA Motorcycles Ltd. BSA also produced its 100,000th <a href="BSA%20Bantam">BSA Bantam</a> motorcycle, a fact celebrated at the 1953 motorcycle show with a visit by Sir <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> to the BSA stand. In 1953 the BSA Professional Cycling Team was managed by <a href="Syd%20Cozens">Syd Cozens</a>. Successes were 5/6 April Bournemouth Two Day Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland, 12 April Dover to London 63 Miles Road Race, 1st Stan Jones, 31 May Langsett 90 Miles Road Race, 1st Bob Maitland and “King of the Mountains”, 7 June Tour of the Wrekin, 1st Bob Maitland, 12 July Severn Valley 100 Miles Road Race, 1st “Tiny” Thomas, 19 July Jackson Trophy, Newcastle, Team Prize, 9 August Les Adams Memorial 80 Miles Road Race, 1st Alf Newman, Team Prize, “King of the Mountains” Arthur Ilsley, 30 August Weston-Super-Mare 100 Miles Grand Prix, 1st Bob Maitland, Team Prize. The team also competed in the 1,624 mile, 12 stage, 1953 Tour of Britain Road Race. The 1953 line up had changed as Arthur Ilsley replaced Pete Proctor in the team. “Tiny” Thomas won the overall individual classification, the Team were runners-up in the team competition and Arthur Ilsley was 3rd in the “King of the Mountains” competition. Bob Maitland also had notable success by winning the Independent National Championship.

1954 saw the introduction of the BSA Quick Release 3 Speed hub gear. It was a split axle three speed gear intended for use with bicycles equipped with oil bath chainguards. The original BSA 3 speed hub gear had been made under licence from the Three-Speed Gear Syndicate since 1907. The design was later to be classified as the <a href="Sturmey-Archer">Sturmey-Archer</a> 'Type X', but all BSA hub gear production ceased in 1955

Sir <a href="Bernard%20Docker">Bernard Docker</a> remained chairman of BSA until 1956 when the BSA removed him. In an acrimonious dispute conducted in the media the matter was brought to the BSA shareholders at the Annual General Meeting where the decision of the Board was upheld. Another significant departure for the fortune of the BSA Group but less controversial was the retirement on ill health grounds of James Leek CBE, Managing Director from 1939 until his retirement. Sir Bernard Docker was replaced as Chairman of the BSA Board by Jack Sangster.

The BSA bicycle division, BSA Cycles Ltd., including the BSA cycle dealer network was sold to <a href="Raleigh%20%28bicycle%29">Raleigh</a> in 1957. Raleigh initially continued bicycle production in Birmingham at Coventry Road, Sheldon, Birmingham 26 into the early 1960s using up BSA parts but as time went on more stock Raleigh parts and fittings were used, some continuing to bear the 'piled arms' stamp. <a href="Tube%20Investments">TI Group</a> owners of the <a href="British%20Cycle%20Corporation">British Cycle Corporation</a> bought Raleigh in 1960 thus gaining access to the BSA brand. Bicycles bearing the BSA name are currently manufactured and distributed within India by <a href="TI%20Cycles%20of%20India">TI Cycles of India</a> but have no direct connection to the original Birmingham BSA company.

In 1960, <a href="Daimler%20Company">Daimler</a> was sold off to <a href="Jaguar%20%28car%29">Jaguar</a>.

1961 was the centenary year of the BSA Group and in recognition of this milestone the company magazine produced an anniversary issue of "BSA Group News" in June "BSA Centenary 1861–1961" in which many of the achievements of the Group were celebrated. This year also saw the end of military rifle production, however BSA still continued to make sporting guns. In 1986 BSA Guns was liquidated, the assets bought and renamed BSA Guns (UK) Ltd. The company continues to make air rifles and shotguns, and is still based in <a href="Small%20Heath%2C%20West%20Midlands">Small Heath</a> in Birmingham.

The Group continued to expand and acquire throughout the 1950s, but by 1965 competition from Japan (in the shape of companies like <a href="Honda">Honda</a>, <a href="Yamaha%20Motor%20Company">Yamaha</a> and <a href="Suzuki">Suzuki</a>) and Europe from <a href="Jawa%20Motors">Jawa</a> / <a href="%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1%20Zbrojovka%20Strakonice">CZ</a>, <a href="Bultaco">Bultaco</a> and <a href="Husqvarna%20Motorcycles">Husqvarna</a> was eroding BSA's market share. The BSA (and Triumph range) were no longer aligned with the markets; <a href="moped">moped</a>s were displacing <a href="scooter%20%28motorcycle%29">scooter</a> sales and the <a href="motorcycle%20trial">trials</a> and <a href="Motorcycle%20scrambling">scrambles</a> areas were now the preserve of European <a href="two-stroke%20engine">two-stroke</a>s. Some poor marketing decisions and expensive projects contributed to substantial losses. For example, the development and production investment of the Ariel 3, an ultra stable 3-wheel moped, was not recouped by sales; the loss has been estimated at £2 million. Furthermore, BSA failed to take seriously the threat that key-start Japanese motor cycles might completely destroy the market for kick-started BSA motor cycles.

In 1968, BSA announced many changes to its product line of singles, twins and the new three-cylinder machine named the "Rocket three" for the 1969 model year. It now concentrated on the more promising USA, and to a lesser extent, Canadian, markets. However, despite the adding of modern accessories, for example, turn signals and even differing versions of the A65 twins for home and export sale, the damage had been done and the end was near.

Reorganisation in 1971 concentrated motorcycle production at Meriden, Triumph's site, with production of components and engines at BSA's Small Heath. At the same time there were <a href="Layoff">redundancies</a> and the selling of assets. <a href="Barclays%20Bank">Barclays Bank</a> arranged financial backing to the tune of £10 million.

Upgrades and service bulletins continued until 1972, but the less service-intensive Japanese bikes had by then flooded the market on both sides of the Atlantic. The merger with Norton Villers was started in late 1972, and for a brief time a Norton 500 single was built with the <a href="BSA%20B50">B50</a>-based unit-single engine, but few if any were sold publicly. The BSA unit single B50's 500 cc enjoyed much improvement in the hands of the CCM motorcycle company allowing the basic BSA design to continue until the mid to late 1970s in a competitive form all over Europe.

The final BSA range was just four models: Gold Star 500, 650 Thunderbolt/Lightning and the 750 cc <a href="BSA%20Rocket%203">Rocket Three</a>. By 1972, BSA was so moribund that, with <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> imminent, its motorcycle businesses were merged (as part of a government-initiated rescue plan) with the <a href="Manganese%20Bronze">Manganese Bronze</a> company, <a href="Norton-Villiers">Norton-Villiers</a>, to become <a href="Norton-Villiers-Triumph">NVT</a>, headed by <a href="Dennis%20Poore">Dennis Poore</a>. The intention was to produce and market <a href="Norton%20Motorcycle%20Company">Norton</a> and <a href="Triumph%20Engineering%20Co%20Ltd">Triumph</a> motorcycles at home and abroad; but Poore's rationalisation led to redundancies of two-thirds of the workforce. In response, the Triumph workers at Meriden set up their own <a href="Meriden%20Cooperative">cooperative</a>. This left Poore with neither BSA nor Triumph, and the sole NVT model was the <a href="Norton%20Commando">Norton Commando</a>. Although this machine won the "<a href="Motor%20Cycle%20News">Motor Cycle News</a>" "Bike of the Year" award for several years running, nothing could hide the fact that the Commando was an old design, being a pre-unit pushrod <a href="Straight-two%20engine">parallel-twin</a>.

In exchange for its motorcycle businesses, Manganese Bronze received BSA Group's non-motorcycle-related divisions—namely, <a href="Carbodies">Carbodies</a>. Although the BSA name was left out of the new company's name, a few products continued to be made carrying it until 1973. However, the plan involved the axing of some brands, large redundancies and consolidation of production at two sites. This scheme to rescue and combine Norton, BSA and Triumph failed in the face of worker resistance. Norton's and BSA's factories were eventually shut down, while Triumph staggered on to fail four years later.

Rights went to Norton Villiers Triumph and on its liquidation were purchased by a new company formed by management and named <a href="BSA%20Company">BSA Company Limited</a>.

Rights were acquired by <a href="Gamo%20%28airgun%20manufacturer%29">Gamo</a> for its new subsidiary BSA Guns (UK) Limited

According to Charles Spencer, BSA was manufacturing the "Delta" bicycle circa 1869. In 1880 the company was approached to manufacture the "Otto Dicycle". An initial contract was signed to produce 210 and a further contract followed for a further 200. In all it is believed that a total of 953 Otto machines were made. BSA then went into bicycle production on their own account, the first machines to their own specification being exhibited at the 1881 <a href="Stanley%20Cycle%20Show">Stanley Show</a>. BSA went on to design and manufacture a "safety" bicycle (patent:15,342 of 1884). BSA was also producing tricycles and a licence was obtained in 1885 to manufacture ball bearings. BSA ceased bicycle manufacture in 1887 because of the demand for arms. Bicycle component manufacture commenced in 1894 and BSA continued to supply the bicycle trade up to 1936. The company recommenced bicycle manufacture on their own account again in 1908 and these were exhibited at the Stanley Show in 1909. Bicycle manufacture was what led BSA into motorcycles. BSA produced bicycles for both the police and military and notably a folding bicycle for the British Army during World War I and the more well known folding Paratroopers bicycle during World War II. BSA supplied the Irish Army with bicycles after 1922.

BSA manufactured a range of bicycles from utility roadsters through to racing bicycles. The BSA range of Sports bicycles expanded in the 1930s following the granting of a patent for a new lighter design of seat lug in 1929 and tandems were introduced into the BSA bicycle range as well. BSA had a reputation for quality and durability and their components were more expensive that either Chater-Lea or Brampton. BSA launched a high end club cyclists machine in the early 1930s initially branded as the "Super-eeze". Never slow to avail of publicity BSA sponsored the great Australian cyclist <a href="Hubert%20Opperman">Hubert Opperman</a> and re-branded the top of the range machine the "Opperman" model. A less expensive range of clubman lightweight machines was introduced from 1936 with the "Cyclo" 3 speed derailleur equipped "Clubman". Subtle changes were made to the range, most models being equipped with "Russ" patent forks and some models were made for only two seasons. This all stopped around September 1939 with the outbreak of war. A revised catalogue with a much reduced range was issued in March 1940 which also saw the launch of the BSA "Streamlight" model. A novel all white bicycle was produced for the blackout but had disappeared from a severely reduced bicycle range the details of which were circulated to dealers from December 1941. BSA had ceased production of their 3 speed hub gear in 1939 and production appears to have started again by 1945 although with a black finish instead of chromium plating. BSA bought Sunbeam in 1943 and produced Sunbeam bicycles using up existing frames and parts and using BSA components for the missing bits. The first BSA produced Sunbeam catalogue was published in 1949

Post war BSA expanded their bicycle range but faced problems of shortages of raw materials such as steel and was required to export a lot of their manufactured output in order to get a Government licence to purchase the necessary raw materials. The company moved bicycle production to the new Waverley Works after World War II. BSA continued to innovate introducing the 4 Star derailleur gear in 1949 along with an associated 4-speed 'unit' or cassette hub. The derailleur design was altered from 1950 and was certainly available up to 1953 but was not a great success. BSA bought New Hudson in 1950 and started to manufacture and sell New Hudson branded machines as well as Sunbeam. It appears that the top of the range BSA lightweight club cyclist machine was the "Gold Column" and this appears to have been changed into the BSA "Tour of Britain" model following the success of the BSA Professional Cycling Team in the 1952 Tour of Britain race. The "Tour of Britain" model was heavily promoted in the BSA 1953 sales literature. The factory made "Tour of Britain" model was not the same as those ridden by the professional team. Only eight machines were crafted for the professional team and none of the components appear to have been standard BSA parts. 1953 saw BSA separate the bicycle / motorcar and motorcycle business into different holdings.

The good times were coming to an end and demand for bicycles fell with the end of rationing in 1954. James Leek, managing director of BSA Cycles Ltd was suffering ill health and he retired in 1956, the same year the BSA Chairman, Sir Bernard Docker, was removed from the BSA Board. <a href="Jack%20Sangster">Jack Sangster</a> who had joined the BSA Board in 1951 following the purchase of his company Triumph Motorcycles became Chairman. The bicycle manufacturing business BSA Cycles Ltd was sold to <a href="Raleigh%20Industries">Raleigh Industries</a> in 1957.

BSA Motorcycles were made by BSA Cycles Ltd, under the BSA parent, up until 1953 when the motorcycle business was moved into holding "BSA Motorcycles Ltd". The first instance of intention to produce motorcycles was reported in <a href="The%20Motor%20Cycle">The Motor Cycle</a>, a British motorcycling journal, in July 1906. The first wholly BSA motorcycle, the 3½ H.P. was built in 1910 and displayed at the first Olympia Show, London on 21 November in that year. Sir <a href="Hallewell%20Rogers">Hallewell Rogers</a>, BSA Chairman, had informed the shareholders at the Company's 1910 AGM in Birmingham "We have decided to put a motor-bicycle on the market for the coming season ... These machines will be on exhibit at the Cycle and Motor Show on November 21st, after which date we look forward to commencing delivery". The machines were available for the 1911 season and entire production sold out. BSA had previously acquired a commercially available engine in 1905 and fitted it to one of their bicycle frames and discovered at first hand the problems that needed to be overcome. BSA Cycles Ltd was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919 under Managing Director Charles Hyde to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles.

BSA produced their only <a href="two-stroke">two-stroke</a> motorcycle design for the 1928 season, the 1.74 H.P. Model A28 with two speed gearbox. It was produced as the A29 and A30 the following two years and became the A31 with a three-speed gearbox in 1931, the last year of production. The post-war 'Bantam' was a German <a href="Dampf-Kraft-Wagen">DKW</a> design, part of war reparation, and not a true BSA design.

BSA motorcycles were sold as affordable motorcycles with reasonable performance for the average user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines, the availability of spares and dealer support. The motorcycles were a mixture of sidevalve and OHV engines offering different performance for different roles, e.g. hauling a <a href="sidecar">sidecar</a>. The bulk of use would be for commuting. BSA motorcycles were also popular with "fleet buyers" in Britain, who (for example) used the Bantams for telegram delivery for the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">Post Office</a> or motorcycle/sidecar combinations for AA patrols <a href="The%20Automobile%20Association">The Automobile Association</a> (AA) breakdown help services. This mass market appeal meant they could claim "one in four is a BSA" on advertising.

Machines with better specifications were available for those who wanted more performance or for competition work.

Initially, after the Second World War, BSA motorcycles were not generally seen as racing machines, compared to the likes of <a href="Norton%20%28motorcycle%29">Norton</a>. In the immediate post-war period few were entered in races such as the TT races, though this changed dramatically in the Junior Clubman event (smaller engine motorcycles racing over some 3 or 4 laps around one of the Isle of Man courses). In 1947 there were but a couple of BSA mounted riders, but by 1952 BSA were in the majority and in 1956 the makeup was 53 BSA, 1 Norton and 1 <a href="Velocette">Velocette</a>.

To improve US sales, in 1954, for example, BSA entered a team of riders in the <a href="Daytona%20200">200 mile Daytona beach race</a> with a mixture of single cylinder <a href="BSA%20Gold%20Star">Gold Stars</a> and twin cylinder <a href="BSA%20Shooting%20Star">Shooting Star</a>s assembled by Roland Pike. The BSA team riders took first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places with two more riders finishing at 8th and 16th. This was the first case of a one brand sweep.

The BSA factory experienced success in the sport of <a href="motocross">motocross</a> with <a href="Jeff%20Smith%20%28motorcyclist%29">Jeff Smith</a> riding a B40 to capture the 1964 and 1965 <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20Motocyclisme">FIM</a> <a href="List%20of%20motocross%20World%20Championship%20results">500 cc Motocross World Championships</a>. It would be the last year the title would be won by a <a href="four-stroke">four-stroke</a> machine until the mid-1990s. A BSA motocross machine was often colloquially known as a "Beezer."

Birmingham rocker Steve Gibbons released a song "BSA" on his 1980 album "Saints & Sinners" as a tribute to the Gold Star. He still plays this song with his band and often performs on the Isle of Man at the TT races.


The C11 used a C10 motor fitted with an <a href="overhead%20valve">overhead valve</a> cylinder head. The C11 frame was almost unchanged until 1951 when BSA added <a href="Plunger%20suspension">plunger rear suspension</a>. Early <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">gearboxes</a> were weak and unreliable. The C11G was available with a three ratio gearbox and rigid frame or a four ratio gearbox and a plunger frame. Both models had better front brakes than earlier models. This model was a common commuter motorcycle, and many survive today.

Used the C11G engine, fitted with an alternator and swinging fork (known as swinging arm) rear suspension.

Bovril

Bovril is the trademarked name of a thick and salty <a href="meat%20extract">meat extract</a> paste similar to a <a href="yeast%20extract">yeast extract</a>, developed in the 1870s by John Lawson Johnston. It is sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar. Bovril is owned and distributed by <a href="Unilever">Unilever</a> UK.

Bovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water, or less commonly, with milk. It can be used as a flavouring for soups, broth, stews or porridge, or as a spread, especially on toast in a similar fashion to <a href="Marmite">Marmite</a> and <a href="Vegemite">Vegemite</a>.

The first part of the product's name comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "bos", meaning "ox". Johnston took the "-vril" suffix from <a href="Edward%20Bulwer-Lytton">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</a>'s then-popular novel, "<a href="The%20Coming%20Race">The Coming Race</a>" (1870), whose plot revolves around a superior race of people, the Vril-ya, who derive their powers from an electromagnetic substance named "Vril". Therefore, Bovril indicates great strength obtained from an ox.

In 1870, in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> ordered one million cans of beef to feed his troops. The task of providing all this beef went to a <a href="Scotsman">Scotsman</a> living in Canada named <a href="John%20Lawson%20Johnston">John Lawson Johnston</a>. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later called Bovril, to meet the needs of Napoleon III. By 1888, over 3,000 <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">UK</a> <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s, grocers and <a href="dispensing%20chemist">dispensing chemist</a>s were selling Bovril. In 1889, the Bovril Company was formed.

Bovril continued to function as a "war food" in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and was frequently mentioned in the 1930 account "Not So Quiet... Stepdaughters of War" by Helen Zenna Smith (<a href="Evadne%20Price">Evadne Price</a>). One account from the book describes it being prepared for the casualties at <a href="Mons%2C%20Belgium%23Battle%20of%20Mons">Mons</a> where "the orderlies were just beginning to make Bovril for the wounded, when the bearers and ambulance wagons were shelled as they were bringing the wounded into the hospital".

A thermos of "beef tea" was the favoured way to fend off the chill of winter matches for generations of British <a href="Association%20football">football</a> enthusiasts; to this day, Bovril dissolved in hot water is sold in stadiums all over the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Bovril "beef tea" was the main warm drink that <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s team had to drink when they were marooned on <a href="Elephant%20Island">Elephant Island</a> during the <a href="Imperial%20Trans-Antarctic%20Expedition">Endurance Expedition</a>.

When John Lawson Johnston died, his son <a href="George%20Lawson%20Johnston%2C%201st%20Baron%20Luke">George Lawson Johnston</a> inherited and took over the Bovril business. In 1929, George Lawson Johnston was created <a href="Baron%20Luke">Baron Luke</a>, of Pavenham, in the county of Bedford.

Bovril's instant beef stock was launched in 1966 and its "King of Beef" range of instant flavours for stews, casseroles and gravy in 1971. In 1971, <a href="Cavenham%20Foods">Cavenham Foods</a> acquired the Bovril Company but then sold most of its dairies and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n operations to finance further take-overs. The brand is now owned by <a href="Unilever">Unilever</a>.

Bovril holds the unusual position of having been advertised with a <a href="Pope">Pope</a>. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> seated on his throne, bearing a mug of Bovril. The campaign slogan read: "The Two Infallible Powers – The Pope & Bovril."

Bovril is also produced in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> by the Bokomo division of Pioneer Foods

During the <a href="Siege%20of%20Ladysmith">Siege of Ladysmith</a> in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, a Bovril-like paste was produced from horse meat within the garrison. Nicknamed "Chevril" (a portmanteau of Bovril and "cheval", French for horse) it was produced by <a href="boiling%20down">boiling down</a> horse or <a href="mule">mule</a> meat to a jelly paste and serving it as a "beef tea".

In 2004, <a href="Unilever">Unilever</a> removed beef ingredients from the Bovril formula, rendering it vegetarian. This was mainly due to concerns about decreasing sales, particularly from exports due to an export ban on British beef, as a result of the growing popularity of <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>, religious dietary requirements, and public concerns about <a href="bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a>. In 2006, Unilever reversed that decision and reintroduced beef ingredients to their Bovril formula once sales increased and the beef export bans were lifted. Unilever now produces Bovril using beef extract and a chicken variety using chicken extract.

Since its invention, Bovril has become an <a href="cultural%20icon">icon</a> of <a href="culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British culture</a>. It is commonly associated with <a href="football%20culture">football culture</a>, since during the winter British football fans in stadium terraces often drink it from <a href="Thermos">Thermos</a> flasks or <a href="disposable%20cup">disposable cup</a>s in Scotland, where thermoses are from football stadiums.

In the movie "<a href="In%20Which%20We%20Serve">In Which We Serve</a>", the officers on the bridge are served "Bovril heavily laced with sherry" to warm them up, after being rescued during the <a href="Operation%20Dynamo">Dunkirk evacuation</a> of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>.

During a 2011 episode of "<a href="Top%20Gear%20%28current%20format%29">Top Gear</a>", <a href="James%20May">James May</a> drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a snowplough in <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and commented: "We all know that when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril. That's a rule of life." Bovril reappeared in another episode of "Top Gear" in the form of <a href="Jeremy%20Clarkson">Jeremy Clarkson</a>'s V8 Food Blender, wherein it was used to make a "Man's V8 Smoothie" complete with raw beef and a <a href="brick">brick</a>.

On "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>" in Season 6, Episode 7, Daphne is upset when Niles throws away a jar of Bovril because it smelled rancid. Daphne exclaims: "That's how it's supposed to smell; It's English!"

In <a href="Steve%20Coogan">Steve Coogan</a>'s 2016 <a href="Alan%20Partridge">Alan Partridge</a> <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> "Scissored Isles", the Partridge character offers Bovril to some teenagers, telling them it's "Basically beef tea."

Benjamin D. Santer

Benjamin David Santer (born June 3, 1955 in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>) is a <a href="climate">climate</a> researcher at <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and former researcher at the <a href="University%20of%20East%20Anglia">University of East Anglia</a>'s <a href="Climatic%20Research%20Unit">Climatic Research Unit</a>. He also worked at the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Meteorology">Max Planck Institute for Meteorology</a> from 1987 to 1992. He specializes mainly in <a href="statistical%20analysis">statistical analysis</a> of climate data sets, and detection/attribution of <a href="Global%20warming%23External%20forcings">climate change forcings</a>.

Santer received a B.SC. in Environmental Sciences and a 1987 Ph.D. in Climatology from the Climatic Research Unit of the <a href="University%20of%20East%20Anglia">University of East Anglia</a>.

In 1998 Santer was awarded a <a href="MacArthur%20Fellowship">MacArthur Fellowship</a> for research supporting the finding that <a href="Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">human activity</a> contributes to global warming. He has also received the <a href="Ernest%20Orlando%20Lawrence%20Award">Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award</a> and a Distinguished Scientist Fellowship from the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a> and the Norbert Gerbier/MUMM award from the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>. He ranked twelfth amongst climate scientists in a 2002 assessment of most cited scientists in the field of global warming.

In 2011, Santer was elected as a fellow of the <a href="American%20Geophysical%20Union">American Geophysical Union</a> and as a member of the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>.

Santer was the convening Lead Author of Chapter 8 of 1995 <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">IPCC</a> Working Group I Report (AR2 WGI), which addressed the <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> issue.

<a href="Frederick%20Seitz">Frederick Seitz</a>, in a June 12, 1996 editorial-page piece in the "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" complained that alterations made to Chapter 8 of the 1995 IPCC report were made to "deceive policy makers and the public into believing that the scientific evidence shows human activities are causing global warming." Similar charges were made by the <a href="Global%20Climate%20Coalition">Global Climate Coalition</a> (GCC), a consortium of industry interests; specifically, they accused Santer of "scientific cleansing."

Santer and 40 other scientists responded to the "Wall Street Journal" that all IPCC procedural rules were followed, and that IPCC procedures required changes to the draft in response to comments from governments, individual scientists, and non-governmental organizations. They stated that the pre- and post-Madrid versions of Chapter 8 were equally cautious in their statements; that roughly 20% of Chapter 8 is devoted to the discussion of uncertainties in estimates of natural climate variability and the expected signal due to human activities; and that both versions of the chapter reached the same conclusion: "Taken together, these results point towards a human influence on climate."

Bernoulli number

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the Bernoulli numbers are a <a href="sequence">sequence</a> of <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s which occur frequently in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. The values of the first 20 Bernoulli numbers are given in the table to the right. For even other than 0, is negative if is divisible by 4 and positive otherwise. For all odd other than 1, .

The superscript ± used in this article designates the two sign conventions for Bernoulli numbers. Only the term is concerned: 

In the formulas below, one can switch from one sign convention to the other with the relation formula_1.

The Bernoulli numbers are special values of the <a href="Bernoulli%20polynomial">Bernoulli polynomial</a>s formula_2, with formula_3 and formula_4.

Since for all odd , and many formulas only involve even-index Bernoulli numbers, some authors write "" to mean . This article does not follow this notation.

The Bernoulli numbers appear in the <a href="Taylor%20series">Taylor series</a> expansions of the <a href="tangent%20function">tangent</a> and <a href="Hyperbolic%20function">hyperbolic tangent</a> functions, in formulas for the sum of powers of the first positive integers, in the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Maclaurin%20formula">Euler–Maclaurin formula</a>, and in expressions for certain values of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>.

The Bernoulli numbers were discovered around the same time by the Swiss mathematician <a href="Jacob%20Bernoulli">Jacob Bernoulli</a>, after whom they are named, and independently by Japanese mathematician <a href="Takakazu%20Seki">Seki Kōwa</a>. Seki's discovery was posthumously published in 1712 in his work "Katsuyo Sampo"; Bernoulli's, also posthumously, in his "<a href="Ars%20Conjectandi">Ars Conjectandi</a>" of 1713. <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>'s <a href="Ada%20Byron%27s%20notes%20on%20the%20analytical%20engine">note G</a> on the <a href="Analytical%20Engine">Analytical Engine</a> from 1842 describes an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> for generating Bernoulli numbers with <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Babbage</a>'s machine. As a result, the Bernoulli numbers have the distinction of being the subject of the first published complex <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a>.

The Bernoulli numbers are rooted in the early history of the computation of sums of integer powers, which have been of interest to mathematicians since antiquity.

Methods to calculate the sum of the first positive integers, the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the first positive integers were known, but there were no real 'formulas', only descriptions given entirely in words. Among the great mathematicians of antiquity which considered this problem were: <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> (c. 572–497 BCE, Greece), <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> (287–212 BCE, Italy), <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> (b. 476, India), <a href="Abu%20Bakr%20al-Karaji">Abu Bakr al-Karaji</a> (d. 1019, Persia) and Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn <a href="al-Haytham">al-Haytham</a> (965–1039, Iraq).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries mathematicians made significant progress. In the West <a href="Thomas%20Harriot">Thomas Harriot</a> (1560–1621) of England, <a href="Johann%20Faulhaber">Johann Faulhaber</a> (1580–1635) of Germany, <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a> (1601–1665) and fellow French mathematician <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> (1623–1662) all played important roles.

Thomas Harriot seems to have been the first to derive and write formulas for sums of powers using symbolic notation, but even he calculated only up to the sum of the fourth powers. Johann Faulhaber gave formulas for sums of powers up to the 17th power in his 1631 "Academia Algebrae", far higher than anyone before him, but he did not give a general formula.

Blaise Pascal in 1654 proved <a href="Faulhaber%27s%20formula">"Pascal's identity"</a> relating the sums of the th powers of the first positive integers for .

The Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was the first to realize the existence of a single sequence of constants which provide a uniform formula for all sums of powers .

The joy Bernoulli experienced when he hit upon the pattern needed to compute quickly and easily the coefficients of his formula for the sum of the th powers for any positive integer can be seen from his comment. He wrote:

Bernoulli's result was published posthumously in "<a href="Ars%20Conjectandi">Ars Conjectandi</a>" in 1713. <a href="Seki%20K%C5%8Dwa">Seki Kōwa</a> independently discovered the Bernoulli numbers and his result was published a year earlier, also posthumously, in 1712. However, Seki did not present his method as a formula based on a sequence of constants.

Bernoulli's formula for sums of powers is the most useful and generalizable formulation to date. The coefficients in Bernoulli's formula are now called Bernoulli numbers, following a suggestion of <a href="Abraham%20de%20Moivre">Abraham de Moivre</a>.

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called <a href="Faulhaber%27s%20formula">Faulhaber's formula</a> after Johann Faulhaber who found remarkable ways to calculate sum of powers but never stated Bernoulli's formula. To call Bernoulli's formula Faulhaber's formula does injustice to Bernoulli and simultaneously hides the genius of Faulhaber as Faulhaber's formula is in fact more efficient than Bernoulli's formula. According to Knuth a rigorous proof of Faulhaber's formula was first published by <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Jacob%20Jacobi">Carl Jacobi</a> in 1834 . E. Knuth's in-depth study of Faulhaber's formula concludes:

The Bernoulli numbers (n)/(n) were introduced by Jakob Bernoulli in the book "<a href="Ars%20Conjectandi">Ars Conjectandi</a>" published posthumously in 1713 page 97. The main formula can be seen in the second half of the corresponding facsimile. The constant coefficients denoted , , and by Bernoulli are mapped to the notation which is now prevalent as , , , . The expression means – the small dots are used as grouping symbols. Using today's terminology these expressions are <a href="Pochhammer%20symbol">falling factorial powers</a> . The factorial notation as a shortcut for was not introduced until 100 years later. The integral symbol on the left hand side goes back to <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> in 1675 who used it as a long letter for "summa" (sum). (The "Mathematics Genealogy Project"
shows Leibniz as the academic advisor of Jakob Bernoulli. See also the "Earliest Uses of Symbols of Calculus".) The letter on the left hand side is not an index of <a href="summation">summation</a> but gives the upper limit of the range of summation which is to be understood as . Putting things together, for positive , today a mathematician is likely to write Bernoulli's formula as:

In fact this formula imperatively suggests to set when switching from the so-called 'archaic' enumeration which uses only the even indices 2, 4, 6… to the modern form (more on different conventions in the next paragraph). Most striking in this context is the fact that the <a href="falling%20factorial">falling factorial</a> has for the value . 
Thus Bernoulli's formula can and has to be written

if stands for the value Bernoulli himself has given to the coefficient at that position.

Many characterizations of the Bernoulli numbers have been found in the last 300 years, and each could be used to introduce these numbers. Here only three of the most useful ones are mentioned:


For the proof of the <a href="Logical%20equivalence">equivalence</a> of the three approaches see or .

The Bernoulli numbers obey the sum formulas 
where formula_10 and denotes the <a href="Kronecker%20delta">Kronecker delta</a>. Solving for formula_11 gives the recursive formulas

In 1893 listed a total of 38 explicit formulas for the Bernoulli numbers , usually giving some reference in the older literature. One of them is:

The exponential <a href="generating%20function">generating function</a>s are

The (normal) generating function

is an <a href="asymptotic%20series">asymptotic series</a>. It contains the <a href="trigamma%20function">trigamma function</a> .

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>:

Here the argument of the zeta function is 0 or negative.

By means of the zeta <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function%23The%20functional%20equation">functional equation</a> and the gamma <a href="Gamma%20function%23General">reflection formula</a> the following relation can be obtained:

Now the argument of the zeta function is positive.

It then follows from () and <a href="Stirling%20formula">Stirling's formula</a> that

In some applications it is useful to be able to compute the Bernoulli numbers through modulo , where is a prime; for example to test whether <a href="Vandiver%27s%20conjecture">Vandiver's conjecture</a> holds for , or even just to determine whether is an <a href="irregular%20prime">irregular prime</a>. It is not feasible to carry out such a computation using the above recursive formulae, since at least (a constant multiple of) arithmetic operations would be required. Fortunately, faster methods have been developed which require only operations (see <a href="big-O%20notation">big notation</a>).

David Harvey describes an algorithm for computing Bernoulli numbers by computing modulo for many small primes , and then reconstructing via the <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>. Harvey writes that the <a href="Asymptotic%20analysis">asymptotic</a> <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">time complexity</a> of this algorithm is and claims that this <a href="implementation">implementation</a> is significantly faster than implementations based on other methods. Using this implementation Harvey computed for . Harvey's implementation has been included in <a href="SageMath">SageMath</a> since version 3.1. Prior to that, Bernd Kellner computed to full precision for in December 2002 and Oleksandr Pavlyk for with <a href="Mathematica">Mathematica</a> in April 2008.

Arguably the most important application of the Bernoulli number in mathematics is their use in the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Maclaurin%20formula">Euler–Maclaurin formula</a>. Assuming that is a sufficiently often differentiable function the Euler–Maclaurin formula can be written as 

This formulation assumes the convention . Using the convention the formula becomes

Here (i.e. the zeroth-order derivative of a is just ). Moreover, let denote an <a href="antiderivative">antiderivative</a> of . By the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>,

Thus the last formula can be further simplified to the following succinct form of the Euler–Maclaurin formula

This form is for example the source for the important Euler–Maclaurin expansion of the zeta function

Here denotes the <a href="Pochhammer%20symbol">rising factorial power</a>.

Bernoulli numbers are also frequently used in other kinds of <a href="asymptotic%20expansion">asymptotic expansion</a>s. The following example is the classical Poincaré-type asymptotic expansion of the <a href="digamma%20function">digamma function</a> .

Bernoulli numbers feature prominently in the <a href="Closed-form%20expression">closed form</a> expression of the sum of the th powers of the first positive integers. For define

This expression can always be rewritten as a <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> in of degree . The <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a>s of these polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by Bernoulli's formula:
where denotes the <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>.

For example, taking to be 1 gives the <a href="triangular%20number">triangular number</a>s .

Taking to be 2 gives the <a href="square%20pyramidal%20number">square pyramidal number</a>s .

Some authors use the alternate convention for Bernoulli numbers and state Bernoulli's formula in this way:

Bernoulli's formula is sometimes called <a href="Faulhaber%27s%20formula">Faulhaber's formula</a> after <a href="Johann%20Faulhaber">Johann Faulhaber</a> who also found remarkable ways to calculate <a href="sums%20of%20powers">sums of powers</a>.

Faulhaber's formula was generalized by V. Guo and J. Zeng to a <a href="q-analog">-analog</a> .

The Bernoulli numbers appear in the <a href="Taylor%20series">Taylor series</a> expansion of many <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a> and <a href="hyperbolic%20function">hyperbolic function</a>s.

The connection of the Bernoulli number to various kinds of combinatorial numbers is based on the classical theory of finite differences and on the combinatorial interpretation of the Bernoulli numbers as an instance of a fundamental combinatorial principle, the <a href="inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion%20principle">inclusion–exclusion principle</a>.

The definition to proceed with was developed by Julius Worpitzky in 1883. Besides elementary arithmetic only the factorial function and the power function is employed. The signless Worpitzky numbers are defined as

They can also be expressed through the <a href="Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20second%20kind">Stirling numbers of the second kind</a>

A Bernoulli number is then introduced as an inclusion–exclusion sum of Worpitzky numbers weighted by the <a href="Harmonic%20progression%20%28mathematics%29">harmonic sequence</a> 1, , , …

This representation has .

Consider the sequence , . From Worpitzky's numbers , applied to is identical to the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to (see <a href="Bernoulli%20number%23Connection%20with%20Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind">Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind</a>). This can be seen via the table:

The first row represents .

Hence for the second fractional Euler numbers () / ():

A second formula representing the Bernoulli numbers by the Worpitzky numbers is for 

The simplified second Worpitzky's representation of the second Bernoulli numbers is:

which links the second Bernoulli numbers to the second fractional Euler numbers. The beginning is:

The numerators of the first parentheses are (see <a href="Bernoulli%20number%23Connection%20with%20Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind">Connection with Stirling numbers of the first kind</a>).

One also has following for Bernoulli polynomials,

Comparing the coefficient of in the two expressions of Bernoulli polynomials, one has:

(resulting in ) which is an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers and can be used to prove <a href="Von%20Staudt%E2%80%93Clausen%20theorem">Von-Staudt Clausen theorem</a>.

The two main formulas relating the unsigned <a href="Stirling%20numbers%20of%20the%20first%20kind">Stirling numbers of the first kind</a> to the Bernoulli numbers (with ) are

and the inversion of this sum (for , )

Here the number are the rational Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers, the first few of which are displayed in the following table.

The Akiyama–Tanigawa numbers satisfy a simple recurrence relation which can be exploited to iteratively compute the Bernoulli numbers. This leads to the algorithm shown in the section 'algorithmic description' above. See /.

An "autosequence" is a sequence which has its inverse binomial transform equal to the signed sequence. If the main diagonal is zeroes = , the autosequence is of the first kind. Example: , the Fibonacci numbers. If the main diagonal is the first upper diagonal multiplied by 2, it is of the second kind. Example: /, the second Bernoulli numbers (see ). The Akiyama–Tanigawa transform applied to = 1/ leads to ("n") / ("n" + 1). Hence:

See and . () / () are the second (fractional) Euler numbers and an autosequence of the second kind.

Also valuable for / (see <a href="Bernoulli%20number%23Connection%20with%20Worpitzky%20numbers">Connection with Worpitzky numbers</a>).

There are formulas connecting Pascal's triangle to Bernoulli numbers 
where formula_48 is the determinant of a n-by-n square matrix part of Pascal’s triangle whose elements are: formula_49

Example:

There are formulas connecting <a href="Eulerian%20number">Eulerian number</a>s to Bernoulli numbers:

Both formulae are valid for if is set to . If is set to − they are valid only for and respectively.

The Stirling polynomials are related to the Bernoulli numbers by . S. C. Woon described an algorithm to compute as a binary tree:

Woon's recursive algorithm (for ) starts by assigning to the root node . Given a node of the tree, the left child of the node is and the right child . A node is written as in the initial part of the tree represented above with ± denoting the sign of .

Given a node the factorial of is defined as

Restricted to the nodes of a fixed tree-level the sum of is , thus

For example:

The <a href="integral">integral</a>
has as special values for .

For example, and . Here denotes the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a> and Ι the <a href="imaginary%20unit">imaginary unit</a>. Already Leonhard Euler ("Opera Omnia", Ser. 1, Vol. 10, p. 351) considered these numbers and calculated

The <a href="Euler%20number">Euler number</a>s are a sequence of integers intimately connected with the Bernoulli numbers. Comparing the
asymptotic expansions of the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers shows that the Euler numbers are in magnitude approximately times larger than the Bernoulli numbers . In consequence:

This asymptotic equation reveals that lies in the common root of both the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. In fact could be computed from these rational approximations.

Bernoulli numbers can be expressed through the Euler numbers and vice versa. Since, for odd , (with the exception ), it suffices to consider the case when is even.

These conversion formulas express an <a href="inverse%20relation">inverse relation</a> between the Bernoulli and the Euler numbers. But more important, there is a deep arithmetic root common to both kinds of numbers, which can be expressed through a more fundamental sequence of numbers, also closely tied to . These numbers are defined for as

and by convention . The magic of these numbers lies in the fact that they turn out to be rational numbers. This was first proved by <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> in a landmark paper "‘De summis serierum reciprocarum’" (On the sums of series of reciprocals) and has fascinated mathematicians ever since. The first few of these numbers are

These are the coefficients in the expansion of .

The Bernoulli numbers and Euler numbers are best understood as "special views" of these numbers, selected from the sequence and scaled for use in special applications.

The expression [ even] has the value 1 if is even and 0 otherwise (<a href="Iverson%20bracket">Iverson bracket</a>).

These identities show that the quotient of Bernoulli and Euler numbers at the beginning of this section is just the special case of when is even. The are rational approximations to and two successive terms always enclose the true value of . Beginning with the sequence starts ( / ):

These rational numbers also appear in the last paragraph of Euler's paper cited above.

Consider the Akiyama–Tanigawa transform for the sequence () / ():

From the second, the numerators of the first column are the denominators of Euler's formula. The first column is − × .

The sequence "S" has another unexpected yet important property: The denominators of "S" divide the factorial ("n" − 1)<nowiki>!</nowiki>. In other words: the numbers "T" = "S"("n" − 1)!, sometimes called <a href="Alternating%20permutations">Euler zigzag numbers</a>, are integers.

Thus the above representations of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers can be rewritten in terms of this sequence as

These identities make it easy to compute the Bernoulli and Euler numbers: the Euler numbers are given immediately by and the Bernoulli numbers are obtained from by some easy shifting, avoiding rational arithmetic.

What remains is to find a convenient way to compute the numbers . However, already in 1877 <a href="Philipp%20Ludwig%20von%20Seidel">Philipp Ludwig von Seidel</a> published an ingenious algorithm which makes it extremely simple to calculate .


Seidel's algorithm is in fact much more general (see the exposition of Dominique Dumont ) and was rediscovered several times thereafter.

Similar to Seidel's approach D. E. Knuth and T. J. Buckholtz gave a recurrence equation for the numbers and recommended this method for computing and ‘on electronic computers using only simple operations on integers’.

V. I. Arnold rediscovered Seidel's algorithm in and later Millar, Sloane and Young popularized Seidel's algorithm under the name <a href="boustrophedon%20transform">boustrophedon transform</a>.

Triangular form:

Only , with one 1, and , with two 1s, are in the OEIS.

Distribution with a supplementary 1 and one 0 in the following rows:

This is , a signed version of . The main andiagonal is . The main diagonal is . The central column is . Row sums: 1, 1, −2, −5, 16, 61…. See . See the array beginning with 1, 1, 0, −2, 0, 16, 0 below.

The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to () / () yields:

1. The first column is . Its binomial transform leads to:

The first row of this array is . The absolute values of the increasing antidiagonals are . The sum of the antidiagonals is 

2. The second column is . Its binomial transform yields:

The first row of this array is . The absolute values of the second bisection are the double of the absolute values of the first bisection.

Consider the Akiyama-Tanigawa algorithm applied to () / ( () = abs( ()) + 1 = .

The first column whose the absolute values are could be the numerator of a trigonometric function.

The first two upper diagonals are =  × . The sum of the antidiagonals is = 2 × ("n" + 1).

− is an autosequence of the second kind, like for instance / . Hence the array:

The main diagonal, here , is the double of the first upper one, here . The sum of the antidiagonals is = 2 × (1). Note that  −  = 2 × .

Around 1880, three years after the publication of Seidel's algorithm, <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Andr%C3%A9">Désiré André</a> proved a now classic result of combinatorial analysis & . Looking at the first terms of the Taylor expansion of the <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a>

The coefficients are the <a href="Euler%20number">Euler number</a>s of odd and even index, respectively. In consequence the ordinary expansion of has as coefficients the rational numbers .

André then succeeded by means of a recurrence argument to show that the <a href="alternating%20permutation">alternating permutation</a>s of odd size are enumerated by the Euler numbers of odd index (also called tangent numbers) and the alternating permutations of even size by the Euler numbers of even index (also called secant numbers).

The arithmetic mean of the first and the second Bernoulli numbers are the associate Bernoulli numbers: 
, , , , , / . Via the second row of its inverse Akiyama–Tanigawa transform , they lead to Balmer series / .

The Akiyama–Tanigawa algorithm applied to () / () leads to the Bernoulli numbers / , / , or without , named intrinsic Bernoulli numbers .

Hence another link between the intrinsic Bernoulli numbers and the Balmer series via ().

The terms of the first row are .

Euler () / () without the second term () are the fractional intrinsic Euler numbers The corresponding Akiyama transform is:

The first line is . preceded by a zero is an autosequence of the first kind. It is linked to the Oresme numbers. The numerators of the second line are preceded by 0. The difference table is:

This is where is the th coefficient of (/).

See . The following fractional numbers are an autosequence of the first kind.

Apply = ()/():

The rows are alternatively autosequences of the first and of the second kind. The second row is /. For the third row, see .

The first column is from <a href="Mersenne%20prime">Mersenne prime</a>s, see . For the second column see .

Consider the triangle () = =

This is <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a> bordered by zeroes. The antidiagonals' sums are , the Fibonacci numbers. Two elementary transforms yield the array ASPEC0, a companion to ASPEC in .

Multiplying the SBD array in by ASPEC0, we have by row sums /:

This triangle is unreduced.

The Bernoulli numbers can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as for integers provided for and the expression is understood as the limiting value and the convention is used. This intimately relates them to the values of the zeta function at negative integers. As such, they could be expected to have and do have deep arithmetical properties. For example, the <a href="Agoh%E2%80%93Giuga%20conjecture">Agoh–Giuga conjecture</a> postulates that is a prime number if and only if is congruent to −1 modulo . Divisibility properties of the Bernoulli numbers are related to the <a href="ideal%20class%20group">ideal class group</a>s of <a href="cyclotomic%20field">cyclotomic field</a>s by a theorem of Kummer and its strengthening in the <a href="Herbrand-Ribet%20theorem">Herbrand-Ribet theorem</a>, and to class numbers of real quadratic fields by <a href="Ankeny%E2%80%93Artin%E2%80%93Chowla%20congruence">Ankeny–Artin–Chowla</a>.

The Bernoulli numbers are related to <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> (FLT) by <a href="Ernst%20Kummer">Kummer</a>'s theorem , which says:

Prime numbers with this property are called <a href="regular%20prime">regular prime</a>s. Another classical result of Kummer are the following <a href="Modular%20arithmetic%23Congruence%20relation">congruences</a>.

A generalization of these congruences goes by the name of -adic continuity.

If , and are positive integers such that and are not divisible by and , then

Since , this can also be written

where and , so that and are nonpositive and not congruent to 1 modulo . This tells us that the Riemann zeta function, with taken out of the Euler product formula, is continuous in the <a href="p-adic%20number">-adic number</a>s on odd negative integers congruent modulo to a particular , and so can be extended to a continuous function for all -adic integers , the <a href="p-adic%20zeta%20function">-adic zeta function</a>.

The following relations, due to <a href="Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>, provide a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers that is more efficient than the one given by their original recursive definition:

The von Staudt–Clausen theorem was given by <a href="Karl%20Georg%20Christian%20von%20Staudt">Karl Georg Christian von Staudt</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Clausen%20%28mathematician%29">Thomas Clausen</a> independently in 1840. The theorem states that for every ,
is an integer. The sum extends over all <a href="prime%20number">primes</a> for which divides .

A consequence of this is that the denominator of is given by the product of all primes for which divides . In particular, these denominators are <a href="square-free">square-free</a> and divisible by 6.

The sum

can be evaluated for negative values of the index . Doing so will show that it is an <a href="odd%20function">odd function</a> for even values of , which implies that the sum has only terms of odd index. This and the formula for the Bernoulli sum imply that is 0 for even and ; and that the term for is cancelled by the subtraction. The von Staudt–Clausen theorem combined with Worpitzky's representation also gives a combinatorial answer to this question (valid for "n" > 1).

From the von Staudt–Clausen theorem it is known that for odd the number is an integer. This seems trivial if one knows beforehand that the integer in question is zero. However, by applying Worpitzky's representation one gets

The generalized Bernoulli numbers are certain <a href="algebraic%20number">algebraic number</a>s, defined similarly to the Bernoulli numbers, that are related to <a href="Special%20values%20of%20L-functions">special values</a> of <a href="Dirichlet%20L-function">Dirichlet -functions</a> in the same way that Bernoulli numbers are related to special values of the Riemann zeta function.

Let be a <a href="Dirichlet%20character">Dirichlet character</a> modulo . The generalized Bernoulli numbers attached to are defined by

Apart from the exceptional , we have, for any Dirichlet character , that if .

Generalizing the relation between Bernoulli numbers and values of the Riemann zeta function at non-positive integers, one has the for all integers :

where is the Dirichlet -function of .

Bubble Bobble

In the game's plot, "Baron Von Blubba" has kidnapped the brothers Bubby and Bobby's girlfriends and turned the brothers into Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. Bub and Bob have to finish 100 levels in the Cave of Monsters in order to rescue them.

In the game, each player controls one of the two dragons. Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas. Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form the word EXTEND, he/she earns a bonus life and both players immediately advance to the next level.

A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles). Enemies turn "angry"—turning pink in color and moving faster—if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.

In the 100th and final level, players face a <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>. This game was one of the first to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: "Come here with your friend." If two players complete the game, they see a "Happy End," in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult "Super" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second "Happy End" is displayed in which Super Drunk is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence. The brothers return to normal and are reunited with their parents and girlfriends.

The popularity of "Bubble Bobble" led Taito (or its licensees) to <a href="porting">port</a> the game to many <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s and <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>s. Ports of the game were released for the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>, <a href="MSX2">MSX2</a>, <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href="X68000">X68000</a>, <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> (<a href="DOS">DOS</a>, 1989 and 1996), <a href="Apple%20II%20series">Apple II</a>, <a href="FM%20Towns%20Marty">FM Towns Marty</a>, <a href="Master%20System">Master System</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>, <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href="Family%20Computer%20Disk%20System">Famicom Disk System</a>, <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a>, <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a> (<a href="Sprint%20Nextel">Sprint PCS</a>) and <a href="UltraCade%20Technologies">UltraCade</a>'s Taito Arcade Classics. 

Of the original 8- and 16-bit ports, the MSX2, NES, Game Boy and Master System ones were made by Taito itself (though the Master System version was distributed by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> instead of Taito). The Game Gear port (which emulates the Master System version of "Bubble Bobble") was done by South Korean developer Open Corporation. The Commodore 64, Spectrum and Amiga versions were developed by <a href="Software%20Creations%20%28UK%29">Software Creations</a> and published in the UK by <a href="Firebird%20Software">Firebird Software</a>. Most of the other computer ports were made by US-based <a href="Novalogic">Novalogic</a> with the exception of the X68000 game in Japan that was done by Dempa Shinbunsha.

Commodore 64 coder Steve Ruddy recalled in <a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>: 

The Master System/Game Gear version is noted for having two hundred levels (in effect the normal and super modes consecutively) and is considered one of the best conversions available. This version was originally released as "Final Bubble Bobble" in 1988 for the Master System in Japan. When it arrived in Europe three years later, the title was shortened to "Bubble Bobble". The game was never released for the Master System in North America (the Game Gear being instead the platform in that region for this particular version of "Bubble Bobble"). 

The X68000 version of "Bubble Bobble" includes a secret "Sybubblun" mode, which contains 20 very difficult levels with the characters changed to those from <a href="Syvalion">Syvalion</a>, another game designed by Fukio Mitsuji.

In 1996, <a href="Taito%20Corporation">Taito</a> announced that they lost the original source code. As <a href="Acclaim%20Cheltenham">Probe Entertainment</a> was in charge of the home conversions, <a href="Taito%20Corporation">Taito</a> sent them a "Bubble Bobble" <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="Printed%20circuit%20board">PCB</a> so they could play the original game and reproduce its mechanics. This led to the release of "Bubble Bobble also featuring <a href="Rainbow%20Islands">Rainbow Islands</a>" for <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> and <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> (<a href="DOS">DOS</a>) in 1996, published by <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a>.

In the <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a> and <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a> versions, since the Game Boy is in its nature a single player device, the storyline involves Bub looking for "Moon Water" to cure his brother, they are known as "Bubble Bobble", and "Classic Bubble Bobble" respectively.

In October 2005, a version was released for the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> as part of the "<a href="Taito%20Legends">Taito Legends</a>" compilation of <a href="retrogaming">classic arcade games</a>.

At the end of 2006, a new port for mobile phones in Europe and Japan was released.

On December 31, 2007, the NES version of "Bubble Bobble" was released on Nintendo's <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> service for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. It costs 500 <a href="Nintendo%20Points">Wii Points</a>, the equivalent of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>5.

The Famicom version of "Bubble Bobble" was also released for the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> on October 16, 2013 for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> and on January 29, 2014 for the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>.

The game's music was written by Japanese team <a href="Zuntata">Zuntata</a>. Ports for home computer versions were made by Peter Clarke (Commodore 64), <a href="David%20Whittaker%20%28video%20game%20composer%29">David Whittaker</a> (Amiga) and <a href="Tim%20Follin">Tim Follin</a> (Atari ST, ZX Spectrum).

On November 11, 2016, the game (alongside 29 other games) was included in the <a href="NES%20Classic%20Edition">NES Classic Edition</a> (known as the Nintendo Classic Mini in Europe).

The arcade version of "Bubble Bobble" was widely <a href="Counterfeit">bootlegged</a> in its day, but due to a security chip installed by Taito (known as the PS4, based on a <a href="Motorola%206800">Motorola 6800</a>) none of the bootlegs played exactly like the original. Through a technique called "<a href="decapping">decapping</a>", the <a href="MAME">MAMEDEV</a> team has been able to reverse engineer the workings of the chip and emulate it perfectly. Following that, project Bubble Bobble REDUX has been able to implement an exact version of "Bubble Bobble" on bootleg boards.

A version also exists for the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> though never officially released. According to one of the creators it was coded by them independently in 1988 as a clone of the C64 version, but when they approached publishers it was deemed that it would not be financially viable to release a licensed product for the BBC Micro at that time.

In 2002 a <a href="Homebrew%20%28video%20games%29">homebrew</a> version for the <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> <a href="TI-83%20series">TI-8x series</a> of <a href="graphing%20calculator">calculators</a> was released. 

During Christmas of 2011, a new version for the <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, entitled "Bubble Bobble 4 CPC" or "BB4CPC" was released for free by programmer CNGSoft, as an update to the original/official CPC version.

In 2012 a pair of "hackers" released the "Bubble Bobble: Lost Cave" project where they have created a new version of "Bubble Bobble" with 100 new levels that runs on the original arcade hardware. The levels are not created from scratch though, they have been selected as the cream of the crop from the various official ports of the game, since Taito granted almost every "Bubble Bobble" version some kind of unique content.

<a href="Mean%20Machines">Mean Machines</a> gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The four reviewers of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" stated that the Game Gear version is a faithful conversion of the original which works well in portable form. They particularly praised the simplicity of the gameplay concept and the graphics, and the two-player link option.

The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the "<a href="Your%20Sinclair">Your Sinclair</a> Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time". <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings.

The creator of "Bubble Bobble" Fukio Mitsuji (MTJ) went on to create other classics such as "<a href="Rainbow%20Islands">Rainbow Islands</a>", "<a href="Syvalion">Syvalion</a>" and "<a href="Volfied">Volfied</a>". He died on December 11, 2008.

"Bubble Bobble" has many sequels, including:

The "Bubble Bobble" characters have made cameo appearances in the manga "Gamest Nª49: Gasmest Island Mokushiroku" on October 1992 created by Shinseisha. Bub, from "Bubble Bobble" and Chack, from "Chack'n'Pop", appeared in the manga on May 2009. "Bubble Bobble" was featured in Episode 4, Season 3 of <a href="Black%20Mirror">Black Mirror</a>, "<a href="San%20Junipero">San Junipero</a>" as a video game played by Yorkie in 1986 at the Tucker club.

Blackwood convention

In the partnership <a href="card%20game">card game</a> <a href="contract%20bridge">contract bridge</a>, the Blackwood convention is a popular <a href="convention%20%28bridge%29">bidding convention</a> that was developed by <a href="Easley%20Blackwood%20Sr.">Easley Blackwood</a>. It is used to explore the partnership's possession of aces, kings and in some variants, the queen of <a href="Trump%20%28card%20games%29">trumps</a>, to judge more precisely whether <a href="Glossary%20of%20contract%20bridge%20terms%23slam">slam</a> is likely to be a good contract.

Two versions of Blackwood are common: "standard" Blackwood, developed by Easley in 1933, and "Roman Key Card" Blackwood ("RKC" or "RKCB"), named for the Italian team which invented it. Standard Blackwood enables one partner to count partnership aces and kings in general. Key card variants are defined by a particular "key" suit and enable counting the trump king and queen, as well as aces and kings. Both versions are initiated by a bid of four notrump (4NT), and the entire family of conventions may be called "Blackwood 4NT" in both versions, or "Key Card 4NT" in the key card variation.

There are other 4NT conventions, such as <a href="Culbertson%204-5%20Notrump">Culbertson 4-5 Notrump</a>, <a href="Norman%20four%20notrump">Norman Four Notrump</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20convention">San Francisco</a>, but almost all bridge partnerships employ some member of the Blackwood family (which includes <a href="Byzantine%20Blackwood%20convention">Byzantine Blackwood</a>) as part of their slam-investigation methods.

If the partnership's preceding call is a natural bid in notrump, then 4NT is usually played as natural. Over an opposing pass it is simply a raise and a invitation to six notrump, a small slam. Over an intervening four of a suit by opponents it is usually played as a competitive raise, expecting to play four notrump. Those natural interpretations may hold in other auctions where the partnership has previously bid notrump naturally or shown a balanced hand conventionally. In some situations where 4NT is a quantitative invitation, especially where 4 is a jump, many partnerships use the <a href="Gerber%20convention">Gerber convention</a> instead of the Blackwood family: 4 asks for the number of aces or key cards.

Where both sides are bidding, 4NT is often played as a conventional takeout asking partner to help choose one of two or three suits, similar to a lower-level takeout double or reply to such a double.
Where standard Blackwood 4NT is in force, a four notrump bid (4NT) asks partner to disclose the number of aces in his hand. With no aces or four, partner replies 5; with one, two, or three aces, 5, 5, or 5, respectively. The difference between no aces and four is clear to the Blackwood bidder (unless the partnership lacks all four) so one member of the partnership knows the combined number of aces. That is often sufficient to set the final contract. (A common agreement is that when spades is not the trump suit, 5 asks responder to bid 5NT. That is useful when the reply to 4NT bypasses the intended trump suit but also shows that slam is likely to be a poor contract because two aces are missing.)

The continuation bid of 5NT asks for the number of kings according to the same code of replies at the six-level: 6 shows no kings or four, etc. Asking for the number of kings confirms that the partnership holds all four aces, so partner may reply at the seven level with expectation of taking thirteen tricks.

A void may be as good as an ace in some situations but it should not be counted as an ace. Some experts (Kantar for one) recommend the 5NT reply to 4NT – the cheapest with no standard assigned meaning – to show a void plus two aces and six of a suit to show a void in the bid suit plus one ace.

A variation of the standard Blackwood convention, known as "Roman Blackwood", was popularized by the famous Italian <a href="Blue%20Team%20%28bridge%29">Blue Team</a> in the 1960s. In Roman Blackwood, the responses are even more ambiguous, but more space-conserving. The basic outline of responses is:

In practice, the ambiguity is unlikely to occur, as a strength difference between hands with 0 or 1 and 3 or 4 aces is big enough that it can be established in previous rounds of bidding. In other words, a partner who has previously shown, for example, 12-15 range of <a href="High%20card%20point">high points</a> is unlikely to hold 3 aces for his bid, etc.

Even Roman Blackwood convention has several variations, revolving around 5 and 5 responses. In all variants, they denote 2 aces. One variation is that 5 shows extra values, while 5 does not. In other variations, responses 5 - 5NT denote specific combinations of aces (same color, same rank, or "mixed").

If the querying partner ascertains that all aces are present, he can continue as follows:

Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB) has largely replaced the standard version among tournament players. It developed from the "Roman Blackwood" variant (see below). According to RKCB there are five equivalent key cards rather than just the four aces: the trump king is counted as the 5th key card. The key card replies to 4NT are more compressed than standard ones and they also begin to locate the queen of trumps.

Although the replies to 4NT are more compressed, it is almost always possible to infer which number of keycards is correct: 0 or 3, 1 or 4, 2 or 5. Evidence for that inference includes the entire auction as well as the number of key cards that the 4NT bidder holds.

The 5 and 5 replies with 2 or 5 key cards also deny and show the trump queen, respectively. (Responder may also show the queen with extra length in trumps, where the ace and king will probably draw all outstanding cards in the suit.)

The 5 and 5 replies tell nothing about the queen or extra length, but the 4NT bidder may ask about that using the cheapest bid other than five of the trump suit. The code for replies to that "queen ask" vary; a common rule is that the cheapest bid in the trump suit denies the queen or extra length and any other call shows it. An option is for the positive calls to show a feature, such as a king in that suit, and 6 of the trump suit can show the queen of trumps with no outside kings.

Roman Key Card Blackwood is predicated on existence of a trump suit, which determines which of the four kings and queens responder should show as key cards. Trump agreement is not necessary, however. One common rule is that the last suit bid before 4NT bid is the key suit, lacking trump agreement.

Some partnerships use the club response to show 1 or 4 and the diamond response to show 3 or none, dubbed "1430" (coincidentally the score for making a vulnerable small slam in a major suit), with the original version being dubbed "3014" when distinction is necessary. In order to facilitate the Queen Ask, an experts' version has been developed, where "1430" is used by the strong hand and "3014" is used by the weak hand. There are specific rules which determine when the asker hand is the weak one and when it is the strong one.

A half-way house between standard Blackwood and RKCB is Keycard Blackwood. Again there are five key cards, including the trump king, but unlike RKCB, the queen of trumps is not considered.

5♣ – 0 or 4 key cards
5 – 1 or 5 key cards 
5 – 2 key cards 
5♠ – 3 key cards

This is advocated by Bernard Magee as being simpler for club players, as with RKCB players are sometimes unsure whether partner holds 0 or 3 key cards, or 1 or 4.

"Kickback" is the variant of RKCB devised by <a href="Jeff%20Rubens">Jeff Rubens</a> in accordance with the <a href="Useful%20space%20principle">Useful space principle</a>. The step responses are the same as in RKCB, but the ask is not necessarily 4NT. Instead it is the 4-level bid immediately above the agreed trump suit; i.e.:

Kickback has the advantage that it saves bidding space and, especially for minor-suit fits, provides safety at the 5-level if the required key cards are missing. Because the Kickback bid would otherwise be a control bid, 4NT is usually substituted as the control bid in that suit (e.g., 4NT is a control bid in hearts if the agreed trump suit is diamonds). The drawback is that in unpracticed partnerships there can be confusion as to whether a bid is Kickback, a control bid or preference for a different strain:

East intended 4 as Kickback, but West thought it was secondary support for hearts, and decided to pass with minimum values. As result, a reasonable grand slam in diamonds was missed.

An established partnership might have agreed that as hearts were not supported after opener's rebid, 4 cannot possibly show support, and must be ace asking in diamonds.

"Redwood" is a variation of Kickback that is only used when a minor suit is trumps. A 4 level bid in the suit above the agreed trump suit is the ace / key card ask and the name comes from the fact that this bid will always be a red suit:

4– RKCB for clubs

4– RKCB for diamonds

Once key cards have been identified the next step bid (other than trumps) can be used to ask for Kings.

One advantage of this approach is that it avoids the potential for misunderstanding that can occur when using Minorwood but one disadvantage is that it uses up one more bid (than Minorwood) and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.

Using "Redwood," the ace/key card ask of 4NT is still used when the trump suit is a major (hearts or spades).

"Minorwood" is a variation of Blackwood, in which the minor suit which the partners agree will be trumps is itself used as the ace/key card ask. The ask will be at the four level. Hence:

4– RKCB for clubs

4– RKCB for diamonds

One disadvantage to this convention is that either the partnership must agree to lose the natural 4 level bid in trumps or have clear agreement on which sequences are slam seeking and which are natural bids. The advantage of this approach is that it conserves bidding space. For example, the use of Redwood reduces the risk of a misunderstanding but uses up one more bid and might constrain the bidding later when asking for Kings or Queens.

Exclusion Blackwood or Voidwood. was devised by <a href="Bobby%20Goldman">Bobby Goldman</a> as an attempt to resolve the situation when the Blackwood-asker has a void. In that case, he is not interested in the partner's ace in the void suit, as he already has the first-round control; partner's ace would present a duplicated value in that case. It should be noted, however, that many players, even experts, refuse to play Exclusion Blackwood because of the potential disaster of forgetting the agreement.

It is usually played as the Roman Key Card Blackwood, with only four key cards: the three Aces outside the void suit and the King of trumps. However, the asking bid is not 4NT, but the void suit — Voidwood is made by jumping on level 4 or 5 in the void suit after a fit has been found, for example:
Bids of 5, 5 and 5 present a Voidwood, denoting the void in the suit bid and asking for other key cards. The responses are, as in RKCB:

When the Blackwood bidder has a void, and partner shows one or more but not all missing aces, "asker" will not know whether partner's ace duplicates the void suit (where it would not be of great help) or covers side suit losers. For this reason <a href="cue%20bid">cue bid</a> to show aces explicitly, or <a href="%23Exclusion%20convention">Exclusion</a> or <a href="%23Voidwood%20convention">Voidwood</a> convention to ask for useful aces, is used with hands that contain a void.

Often non-experts ask for aces when they really need other information from partner, acting act as if the convention is designed to ascertain whether the partnership holds "all" of the four aces or five key-cards. In fact the fundamental purpose should usually be to distinguish between lacking one and lacking two, because lacking two aces makes slam a bad bet. In other words, ace and key-card asking conventions should normally be used by one member of a partnership who plans at least to contract for 12 tricks if no more than one ace or key card is lacking.

A simplified way to think about Blackwood is this: "I am concerned that we may lose the first two tricks, if we bid a slam. I can use Blackwood as a kind of insurance policy, to guarantee that this will not happen." But Blackwood will not help if, due to the structure of the hands, there are multiple ways to lose the first two tricks. It only helps, for the most part, if the exclusive risk of losing the first two tricks is due to the opponents' holding two cashable aces. Obviously, the opposition might hold the ace and king of a side suit, and could bang those tricks right down, resulting in an immediate set.

Thus, a player should use Blackwood only when he can ascertain that the partnership holds at least second-round controls in all suits (kings or, if a suit fit is found, singletons). Thus, a Blackwood query by the player holding two quick losers in a side suit is a wild gamble, as it is still possible that the suit is not controlled by an Ace or a King.

For the same reason, it is generally wrong to use Blackwood with a void. This is not always true, but the rule of thumb is: Don't use Blackwood with a void unless you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it. You may be missing two aces, but your void may compensate for the lack of one of the enemy aces. Thus, Blackwood will not tell you what you want to know: Are we at risk of losing the first two tricks? If your side has two aces and a void, then you are not at risk of losing the first two tricks, so long as (a) your void is useful (i.e., does not duplicate the function of an ace that your side holds) and (b) you are not vulnerable to the loss of the first two tricks in the fourth suit (because, for instance, one of the partnership hands holds a singleton in that suit or the protected king, giving your side second round control).

Other problems can easily occur when a minor is the agreed trump suit, or the key suit when no trump suit is agreed. The reply to Blackwood could take the partnership past their agreed suit and going to the next higher level may be one trick too high. In these cases experts agree on using the Kickback or <a href="%23Redwood%20convention">Redwood</a> convention to save steps and be able to stop at 5 or 5. An alternative is to avoid using any type of Ace asking and use the cue bid alternative.

A further problem occurs when, after hearing his partner's response, the player who bid 4NT wants to stop in 5NT — as this is a forcing bid asking for Kings. A common agreement is that the first non-suit asks responder to bid 5NT. Whenever the first non-suit is a "queen ask", then the next non-suit asks to bid 5NT. This has to be planned in advance as if there is no such space partners have to bid a usually unmakeable slam contract.

Bill Bixby

Wilfred Bailey Everett "Bill" Bixby III (January 22, 1934 − November 21, 1993) was an American actor, director, producer, and frequent game-show <a href="panelist">panelist</a>. His career spanned more than three decades, including appearances on stage, in films, and on television series. He is known for his roles as Tim O'Hara on the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="My%20Favorite%20Martian">My Favorite Martian</a>", Tom Corbett on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="The%20Courtship%20of%20Eddie%27s%20Father">The Courtship of Eddie's Father</a>", and stage illusionist Anthony Blake in the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> crime drama series "<a href="The%20Magician%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Magician</a>", but is perhaps best known for his role as scientist Dr. David Banner on the CBS science-fiction drama series "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">The Incredible Hulk</a>".

An only child, Bixby was born a fourth-generation Californian of English descent, in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>. His father, Wilfred Everett Bixby II, was a store clerk and his mother, Jane (née McFarland) Bixby, was a senior manager at I. Magnin & Co. In 1942, when Bixby was eight years old, his father enlisted in the Navy during World War II and traveled to the South Pacific. While in the seventh grade, Bixby attended Grace Cathedral and sang in the church's choir. In one notable incident, he shot the bishop using a slingshot during a service and was kicked out of the choir. In 1946, his mother encouraged him to take ballroom dance lessons and from there he started dancing all around the city. While dancing, he attended <a href="Lowell%20High%20School%20%28San%20Francisco%29">Lowell High School</a>, where he perfected his oratory and dramatic skills as a member of the Lowell Forensic Society. Though he received average grades, he also competed in high-school speech tournaments regionally. After graduation from high school in 1952, against his parents' wishes, he majored in drama at <a href="City%20College%20of%20San%20Francisco">City College of San Francisco</a>, where he was a classmate of <a href="Lee%20Meriwether">Lee Meriwether</a>, another young actress who later won the title of Miss America as Miss California 1954. Bixby and Meriwether later worked together on an episode of "<a href="Barnaby%20Jones">Barnaby Jones</a>".

During the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Bixby was drafted shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Rather than report to the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, Bixby joined the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Reserve">United States Marine Corps Reserve</a>. He served primarily in the personnel management field with Marine Attack Squadron 141 (<a href="VMA-141">VMA-141</a>) at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Oakland">Naval Air Station Oakland</a>, and attained the rank of private first class before his 1956 discharge. Later, he attended the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, his parents' alma mater, and left just a few credits short of earning a degree. He then moved to <a href="Hollywood%2C%20California">Hollywood, California</a>, where he had a string of odd jobs that included bellhop and lifeguard. He organized shows at a resort in <a href="Jackson%20Hole%2C%20Wyoming">Jackson Hole, Wyoming</a>, and in 1959, he was hired to work as a model and to do commercial work for <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> and <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>.

In 1961, Bixby was in the musical "<a href="The%20Boy%20Friend%20%28musical%29">The Boy Friend</a>" at the Detroit Civic Theater, returning to Hollywood to make his television debut on an episode of "<a href="The%20Many%20Loves%20of%20Dobie%20Gillis">The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis</a>". He became a highly regarded <a href="character%20actor">character actor</a> and guest-starred on many television series, including "<a href="Ben%20Casey">Ben Casey</a>", "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">The Twilight Zone</a>", "<a href="The%20Andy%20Griffith%20Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a>", "<a href="Dr.%20Kildare%20%28TV%20series%29">Dr. Kildare</a>", "<a href="Straightaway">Straightaway</a>", and "<a href="Hennesey">Hennesey</a>". He also joined the cast of "The <a href="Joey%20Bishop">Joey Bishop</a> Show" in 1962. In 1963, he played a sailor with a Napoleon tattoo in the movie "<a href="Irma%20La%20Douce">Irma La Douce</a>", a romantic comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, directed by Billy Wilder based on the 1956 French musical. During the 1970s, he made guest-appearances on television series such as "<a href="Ironside%20%28TV%20series%29">Ironside</a>", "<a href="Insight%20%28TV%20series%29">Insight</a>", "<a href="Barbary%20Coast%20%28TV%20series%29">Barbary Coast</a>", "<a href="The%20Love%20Boat">The Love Boat</a>", "<a href="Medical%20Center%20%28TV%20series%29">Medical Center</a>", four episodes of "<a href="Love%2C%20American%20Style">Love, American Style</a>", "<a href="Fantasy%20Island">Fantasy Island</a>", and two episodes each of "<a href="The%20Streets%20of%20San%20Francisco">The Streets of San Francisco</a>", and <a href="Rod%20Serling">Rod Serling</a>'s "<a href="Night%20Gallery">Night Gallery</a>".

Bixby took the role of young reporter Tim O'Hara in the 1963 CBS sitcom, "<a href="My%20Favorite%20Martian">My Favorite Martian</a>", in which he co-starred with <a href="Ray%20Walston">Ray Walston</a>. By 1966, though, high production costs forced the series to come to an end after 107 episodes. After the cancellation of "Martian", Bixby starred in five movies: "<a href="Ride%20Beyond%20Vengeance">Ride Beyond Vengeance</a>", "<a href="Doctor%2C%20You%27ve%20Got%20to%20Be%20Kidding%21">Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!</a>", and two of <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s movies, "<a href="Clambake">Clambake</a>", and "<a href="Speedway%20%28film%29">Speedway</a>". He turned down the role as <a href="Marlo%20Thomas">Marlo Thomas</a>'s boyfriend in the successful "<a href="That%20Girl">That Girl</a>", though he later guest-starred on the show, and starred in two failed pilots.

In 1969, Bixby starred in his second high-profile television role, as Tom Corbett in "The Courtship of Eddie's Father", a <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> on ABC. The series concerned a widowed father raising a young son, managing a major syndicated magazine, and at the same time trying to re-establish himself on the dating scene. This series was in the vein of other 1960s and 1970s sitcoms that dealt with <a href="widower">widower</a>hood, such as "<a href="The%20Andy%20Griffith%20Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a>" and "<a href="My%20Three%20Sons">My Three Sons</a>". Eddie was played by novice actor <a href="Brandon%20Cruz">Brandon Cruz</a>. The pair developed a close rapport that translated to an off-camera friendship, as well. The cast was rounded out by <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning actress <a href="Miyoshi%20Umeki">Miyoshi Umeki</a>, who played the role of Tom's housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston; <a href="James%20Komack">James Komack</a> (one of the series' producers) as Norman Tinker (Tom's pseudo-hippie, quirky photographer), and actress Kristina Holland as Tom's secretary, Tina. One episode of the series co-starred Bixby's future wife, <a href="Brenda%20Benet">Brenda Benet</a>, as one of Tom's girlfriends.
Bixby was nominated for the <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1971. The following year, he won the Parents Without Partners Exemplary Service Award for 1972.

Bixby made his directorial debut on the sitcom in 1970, directing eight episodes. ABC canceled the sitcom in 1972 at the end of season three.

After the show was canceled, Bixby and Cruz remained in contact, with Cruz making a guest appearance on Bixby's later series "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">The Incredible Hulk</a>". The death of Bixby's only child, in 1981, drew Bixby and Cruz closer still. The two remained in touch until Bixby's death in 1993. In 1995, Cruz named his own son Lincoln Bixby Cruz.

Brandon Cruz said of the show which developed a professional father-son relationship, compared to that of "The Andy Griffith Show", "We dealt with issues that were talked about but were never brought up on television. Bill wasn't the first actor to portray a single widowed father, but he became one of the popular ones, because of his easy-going way of this crazy little kid." Prior to Bixby's promotion as the director, Brandon said, "He was looking for the best dolly grip, along with the boom operator that if something was called specifically and failed, Bill could be easily angry." On the kind of relationship Bill had wanted with his co-star, Brandon also said, "Bill would never speak down to me. Bill treated me as an equal. He made sure that we had a lot of time together, just so he could kinda crawl inside my head and see what actually made a kid tick." The final thing he realized of Bill's real-life father's death in 1971, and when asked about his mentor’s father’s loss, he stated: "He had that type of mentality that the show must go on, thinking it was just a great T.V. show, after he broke down weeping."

In 1973, Bixby starred in "<a href="The%20Magician%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Magician</a>". The series was well liked, but it lasted only one season. An accomplished amateur magician himself, he hosted several TV specials in the mid-1970s which featured other amateur magicians, and was a respected member of the Hollywood magic community, belonging to <a href="The%20Magic%20Castle">The Magic Castle</a>, an exclusive club for magicians. During the show's popular, although short-lived production, Bixby as always, invited a few old friends along to co-star such as <a href="Pamela%20Britton">Pamela Britton</a> (in her final role), <a href="Kristina%20Holland">Kristina Holland</a> and Ralph O'Hara.

Also in 1973, he starred in "<a href="Steambath%20%28play%29">Steambath</a>", a play by author <a href="Bruce%20Jay%20Friedman">Bruce Jay Friedman</a>, on <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> with <a href="Valerie%20Perrine">Valerie Perrine</a> and Jose Perez.

He became a popular game-show panelist, appearing mostly on "<a href="Password">Password</a>" and "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Squares">The Hollywood Squares</a>". He was also a panelist on the 1974 revival of "<a href="Masquerade%20Party">Masquerade Party</a>" hosted by <a href="Richard%20Dawson">Richard Dawson</a>. He had also appeared with Dawson on "Cop-Out". In 1974-1975, he directed four episodes of the eighth season of "<a href="Mannix">Mannix</a>", and he guest-starred as Mannix's friend-turned-villain in one of the episodes.

In 1975, he co-starred with <a href="Tim%20Conway">Tim Conway</a> and <a href="Don%20Knotts">Don Knotts</a> in the Disney movie "<a href="The%20Apple%20Dumpling%20Gang%20%28film%29">The Apple Dumpling Gang</a>", which was well received by the public.

Returning to television, he worked with <a href="Susan%20Blakely">Susan Blakely</a> on "<a href="Rich%20Man%2C%20Poor%20Man%20%28miniseries%29">Rich Man, Poor Man</a>", a highly successful television miniseries in 1976. He played a daredevil stunt pilot in an episode of the short-lived 1976 <a href="CBS">CBS</a> adventure series "<a href="Spencer%27s%20Pilots">Spencer's Pilots</a>", starring <a href="Gene%20Evans">Gene Evans</a>. In 1977, he co-starred in the pilot for the television series "<a href="Fantasy%20Island">Fantasy Island</a>"; starred in "No Way Out", the final episode of the NBC anthology series "<a href="Quinn%20Martin%27s%20Tales%20of%20the%20Unexpected">Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected</a>" (known in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as "Twist in the Tale"); and appeared with <a href="Donna%20Mills">Donna Mills</a>, <a href="Richard%20Jaeckel">Richard Jaeckel</a>, and <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> in the last episode, "The Scarlet Ribbon", of NBC's Western series "<a href="The%20Oregon%20Trail%20%28TV%20series%29">The Oregon Trail</a>", starring <a href="Rod%20Taylor">Rod Taylor</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Stevens">Andrew Stevens</a>. Bixby directed two episodes of "The Oregon Trail".

In 1976, he was honored with two <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations, one for Outstanding Lead Actor for a Single Appearance in Drama or Comedy for "The Streets of San Francisco" and the other for Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Comedy or Drama Series for "Rich Man, Poor Man".

Bixby hosted "<a href="Once%20Upon%20a%20Classic">Once Upon a Classic</a>" on <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> from 1976 to 1980.

Although he initially declined the role of Dr. David Banner in "The Incredible Hulk" because of its comic-book origins, on reading <a href="Kenneth%20Johnson%20%28producer%29">Kenneth Johnson</a>'s script for the pilot episode, he was persuaded to change his mind (and agreed to remain involved with the series for as long as Johnson was to be involved). Consequently, Bixby starred in the pilot movie called "The Incredible Hulk", based loosely on the <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a> and <a href="Jack%20Kirby">Jack Kirby</a> <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel</a> characters. Its success (coupled with some theatrical releases of the film in Europe) convinced CBS to turn it into a weekly series, which began airing in the spring of 1978. It became an international hit, seen in over 70 countries. The series made Bixby a popular icon of the late 1970s and 1980s. The pilot also starred <a href="Susan%20Sullivan">Susan Sullivan</a> as Dr. Elaina Marks, who tries to help the conflicted and widowed Dr. Banner overcome his "problem", and falls in love with him in the process. In a retrospective on "The Incredible Hulk", <a href="Glenn%20Greenberg">Glenn Greenberg</a> declared Bixby's performance to be the series's "foremost" strength, elaborating that he "masterfully conveyed the profound loneliness and tragedy of Dr. Banner while also bringing to the role an abundance of warmth, intelligence, humor, nobility, likability, and above all else, humanity."

During the series' run, Bixby invited two of his longtime friends, <a href="Ray%20Walston">Ray Walston</a> and <a href="Brandon%20Cruz">Brandon Cruz</a>, to guest-star with him in different episodes of the series. He also worked on the series with his friend, movie actress <a href="Mariette%20Hartley">Mariette Hartley</a>, who later starred with Bixby in his final series, "<a href="Goodnight%2C%20Beantown">Goodnight, Beantown</a>" in 1983. Hartley appears in the well-regarded double-length episode "Married", and subsequently won an Emmy Award for her guest appearance. Future star <a href="Loni%20Anderson">Loni Anderson</a> also guest starred with Bixby during the first season. Bixby directed one episode of the series, "Bring Me the Head of the Hulk" in 1980 (original airdate: January 9, 1981). The series was canceled after the following season, but leftover episodes aired as late as the next June. Bixby later executive-produced and reprised the role in three television movies – "<a href="The%20Incredible%20Hulk%20Returns">The Incredible Hulk Returns</a>", "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20the%20Incredible%20Hulk">The Trial of the Incredible Hulk</a>", and "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20the%20Incredible%20Hulk">The Death of the Incredible Hulk</a>" – the last two of which he also directed, and the first of which he has been said to have unofficially co-directed.

Bixby was executive producer and co-star of the short-lived sitcom "Goodnight, Beantown" (1983–84). He also directed three episodes of the series. During the same time, Bixby directed several episodes of another short-lived television series, "<a href="Wizards%20and%20Warriors%20%28TV%20series%29">Wizards and Warriors</a>", which aired in 1983. From 1983 to 1984, he hosted a documentary series for <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> entitled "<a href="Against%20the%20Odds%20%28TV%20series%29">Against the Odds</a>". The series, which was canceled after only two seasons, consists of short biographies of famous people throughout history. From 1986 to 1987, he hosted the syndicated weekday anthology series "True Confessions". In 1987, he directed eight episodes of the satirical police sitcom "<a href="Sledge%20Hammer%21">Sledge Hammer!</a>", including the episode, "Hammer Hits the Rock" in season two, where he made an uncredited appearance as Zeke.
Bixby hosted two Elvis specials, both from Las Vegas: "The Elvis Files" (August 1991) and "The Elvis Conspiracy" (January 1992).

Bixby made his last acting appearance in 1992, guest-starring on an episode of "".

He finished his career by directing 30 episodes (in seasons two and three) of the NBC sitcom "<a href="Blossom%20%28TV%20series%29">Blossom</a>".

Bixby's first marriage was to actress <a href="Brenda%20Benet">Brenda Benet</a>. They were married in 1971 and she gave birth to their son Christopher in 1974. In 1981, Christopher died suddenly of a rare throat infection. Bixby and Benet divorced shortly afterwards, and Benet committed suicide the following year. In 1989, he met Laura Michaels, who had worked on the set of one of his "Hulk" movies. The couple married a year later in Hawaii. In early 1991, Bixby was diagnosed with <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> and underwent treatment. He was divorced in the same year. In late 1992, friends introduced him to the artist Judith Kliban, widow of <a href="B.%20Kliban">B. Kliban</a>, a cartoonist who had died of a pulmonary embolism. Bixby married Judith in late 1993, just six weeks before he collapsed on the set of "Blossom".

In early 1993, after rumors began circulating about his health, Bixby went public with his illness, and made several appearances on shows such as "<a href="Entertainment%20Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a>", "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">The Today Show</a>", and "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>", among others.

On November 21, 1993, six days after Bixby's final assignment on "Blossom", he died of complications from prostate cancer in <a href="Century%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Century City, Los Angeles</a>. He was 59 years old.

Boer

Boer (, or ; ) is the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> and <a href="Afrikaans%20language">Afrikaans</a> word for "farmer". As used in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, it was used to denote the descendants of the Dutch-speaking <a href="settler">settler</a>s of the eastern Cape frontier in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a> during the 18th century. For a long time the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> controlled this area, but it was eventually taken over by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and incorporated into the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>.

In addition the term was applied to those who left the <a href="British%20Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> during the 19th century to settle in the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>, <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> (which are together known as the <a href="Boer%20Republics">Boer Republics</a>), and to a lesser extent <a href="Natalia%20Republic">Natal</a>. They left the Cape primarily to escape British rule and get away from the constant border wars between the British imperial government and the indigenous peoples on the eastern frontier.

The <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> had been formed in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> in 1602, and the Dutch had entered keenly into the competition for the colonial and imperial trade of commerce in Southeast Asia. In 1648 one of their ships was stranded in <a href="Table%20Bay">Table Bay</a>, and the shipwrecked crew had to forage for themselves on shore for several months. They were so impressed with the natural resources of the country that on their return to the Republic, they represented to the directors of the company the great advantages to the Dutch Eastern trade to be had from a properly provided and fortified station of call at the Cape. The result was that in 1652, a Dutch expedition led by surgeon <a href="Jan%20van%20Riebeek">Jan van Riebeek</a> constructed a fort and laid out vegetable gardens at Table Bay.

Landing at Table Bay, Van Riebeek took control over <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, the settlement developed during the previous 10 years. In 1671 the Dutch first purchased land from the native <a href="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> beyond the limits of the fort built by Van Riebeek; this marked the development of <a href="Dutch%20Cape%20Colony">the Colony proper</a>. The earliest colonists were for the most part people of low station; but, as the result of the investigations of a 1685 commissioner, the government worked to recruit a greater variety of immigrants to develop a stable community. They formed a class of a class of ""vrijlieden"", also known as ""vrijburgers"" (free citizens), former Company employees who remained at the Cape after serving their contracts. A large number of "vrijburgers" became independent farmers and applied for grants of land, as well as loans of seed and tools, from the Company administration.

More settlers were landed from time to time, including a number of orphan girls from <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, and during 1688–1689, the colony was greatly strengthened by the arrival of nearly two hundred French <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a>. Political refugees from the religious wars in France, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, they were settled at <a href="Stellenbosch">Stellenbosch</a>, <a href="Drakenstein">Drakenstein</a>, <a href="Franschhoek">Franschhoek</a> and <a href="Paarl">Paarl</a>. The influence of this small body of immigrants on the character of the Dutch settlers was marked. The Company in 1701 directed that only <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> should be taught in the schools. This resulted in the Huguenots assimilating by the middle of the 18th century, with a loss to the community in the use and knowledge of <a href="French%20language">French</a>. The little settlement gradually spread eastwards, and in 1754 the country as far as <a href="Algoa%20Bay">Algoa Bay</a> was included in the colony.

At this time the European (white) colonists numbered eight to ten thousand. They possessed numerous slaves, grew wheat in sufficient quantity to make it a commodity crop for export, and were famed for the good quality of their wines. But their chief wealth was in cattle. They enjoyed considerable prosperity. 
Through the latter half of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century, troubles arose between the colonists and the government. The administration of the Dutch East India Company was extremely <a href="despotism">despotic</a>. Its policies were not directed at development of the colony, but to using it to profit the Company. The Company closed the colony against free immigration, kept the whole of the trade in its own hands, combined the administrative, legislative and judicial powers in one body, prescribed to the farmers the nature of the crops they were to grow, demanded a large part of their produce as a kind of tax, and made other exactions.

From time to time, servants in the direct employment of the company were endowed with the right of "freeburghers"; but the company retained the power to compel them to return into its service whenever they deemed it necessary. This right to force into servitude those who might incur the displeasure of the governor or other high officers was not only exercised with reference to the individuals themselves who had received this conditional freedom; it was claimed by the government to be applicable likewise to the children of all such.

The effect of this <a href="tyranny">tyranny</a> was inevitable: it drove men to desperation. They fled from oppression, and even before 1700 <a href="Trekboer">trekking</a> began. In 1780, <a href="Joachim%20van%20Plettenberg">Joachim van Plettenberg</a>, the governor, proclaimed the <a href="Sneeuberge">Sneeuberge</a> to be the northern boundary of the colony, expressing "the anxious hope that no more extension should take place, and with heavy penalties forbidding the rambling peasants to wander beyond." In 1789, so strong had feeling amongst the burghers become that delegates were sent from the Cape to interview the authorities at <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. After this deputation, some nominal reforms were granted.

It was largely to escape oppression that the farmers trekked farther and farther from the seat of government. The company, to control the emigrants, established a magistracy at <a href="Swellendam">Swellendam</a> in 1745 and another at <a href="Graaff%20Reinet">Graaff Reinet</a> in 1786. The <a href="Gamtoos%20River">Gamtoos River</a> had been declared, c. 1740, the eastern frontier of the <a href="Dutch%20Cape%20Colony">colony</a>; but it was soon passed. In 1780, however, the Dutch, to avoid collision with the warlike <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> tribes advancing south and west from east central Africa, agreed with them to make the <a href="Great%20Fish%20River">Great Fish River</a> the common boundary. In 1795 the heavily taxed burghers of the frontier districts, who were afforded no protection against the Bantus, expelled the officials of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, and set up independent governments at <a href="Swellendam">Swellendam</a> and <a href="Graaff%20Reinet">Graaff Reinet</a>.

The <a href="trekboer">Trek Boers</a> of the 19th century were the lineal descendants of the Trek Boers of the 18th century. What they had learnt of government from the Dutch East India Company they carried into the wilderness with them. The end of the 19th century saw a revival of this same tyrannical monopolist policy in the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a>. If the formula, “In all things political, purely despotic; in all things commercial, purely monopolist,” was true of the government of the Dutch East India Company in the 18th century, it was equally true of <a href="Paul%20Kruger">Kruger</a>'s government in the latter part of the 19th.

The underlying fact which made the <a href="great%20Trek">trek</a> possible is that the Dutch-descended colonists in the eastern and northeastern parts of the colony were not cultivators of the soil, but of purely pastoral and nomadic habits, ever ready to seek new pastures for their flocks and herds, and possessing no special affection for any particular locality. These people, thinly scattered over a wide territory, had lived for so long with little restraint from law that when, in 1815, by the institution of “Commissions of Circuit,” justice was brought nearer to their homes, various offences were brought to light, the remedying of which caused much resentment.

In 1795, <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Holland</a> having fallen under <a href="French%20First%20Republic">the revolutionary government of France</a>, a British force under <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> Sir <a href="James%20Henry%20Craig">James Henry Craig</a> was sent to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> to secure the colony for the <a href="William%20V%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Prince of Orange</a>, a refugee in England , from the French. <a href="Dutch%20Cape%20Colony%23Commanders%20and%20governors%20of%20the%20Cape%20Colony%20%281652%E2%80%931806%29">The governor of Cape Town</a> at first refused to obey the instructions from the prince; but, when the British proceeded to take forcible possession, he capitulated. His action was hastened by the fact that the Khoikhoi, deserting their former masters, flocked to the British standard. The burghers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until a force had been sent against them; in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the <a href="peace%20of%20Amiens">peace of Amiens</a> (February 1803), the colony was handed over to the <a href="Batavian%20Republic">Batavian Republic</a>, which introduced many needed reforms, as had the British during their eight years' rule. One of the first acts of General Craig had been to abolish torture in the administration of justice. Still the country remained essentially Dutch, and few British settlers were attracted to it. Its cost to the British exchequer during this period was <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>16,000,000. The Batavian Republic entertained very liberal views as to the administration of the country, but they had little opportunity for giving them effect.

War having broken out in 1803, a British force was once more sent to the Cape. After an engagement (January 1806) on the shores of Table Bay, the Dutch garrison of <a href="Cape%20Castle">Cape Castle</a> surrendered to the British under <a href="David%20Baird%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir David Baird</a>, and in 1814 the colony was ceded outright by Holland to <a href="British%20Empire">the British crown</a>. At that time the colony extended to the line of mountains guarding the vast central plateau, then called <a href="San%20people">Bushmansland</a>, and had an area of about 120,000 sq. m. and a population of some 60,000, of whom 27,000 were whites, 17,000 free Khoikhoi and the rest slaves, mostly imported blacks and Malays.

Although the colony was fairly prosperous, many of the Dutch farmers were as dissatisfied with British rule as they had been with that of the Dutch East India Company, though their grounds for complaint were not the same. In 1792 <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Moravia">Moravian</a> missions had been established for the benefit of the <a href="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a>, and in 1799 the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> began work among both Khoikhoi and <a href="Bantus">Bantus</a>. The missionaries' championing of Khoikhoi grievances caused much dissatisfaction among the majority of the colonists, whose views temporarily prevailed, for in 1812 an ordinance was issued which empowered magistrates to bind Khoikhoi children as apprentices under conditions differing little from that of <a href="slavery">slavery</a>. Meantime, however, the movement for the <a href="abolition%20of%20slavery">abolition of slavery</a> was gaining strength in England, and the missionaries appealed from the colonists to the mother country. An incident which occurred in 1815–1816 did much to make permanent the hostility of the frontiersmen to the British.

A farmer named Frederick Bezuidenhout refused to obey a summons issued on the complaint of a Khoikhoi, and, firing on the party sent to arrest him, was himself killed by the return fire. This caused a small <a href="rebellion">rebellion</a>, known as <a href="Slachter%27s%20Nek%20Rebellion">Slachters Nek</a>, in 1815, called “the most insane attempt ever made by a set of men to wage war against their sovereign” (<a href="Henry%20Cloete">Henry Cloete</a>). Upon its suppression five ringleaders were publicly hanged at the spot where they had sworn to expel “the English tyrants.” The feeling caused by the hanging of these men was deepened by the circumstances of the execution ,  for the scaffold on which the rebels were simultaneously hanged broke down from their united weight and the men were afterwards hanged one by one. An ordinance was passed in 1827, abolishing the old Dutch courts of landroost and heemraden (resident magistrates being substituted) and establishing that henceforth all legal proceedings should be conducted in English. The granting in 1828, as a result of the representations of the missionaries, of equal rights with whites to the <a href="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> and other free <a href="coloured">coloured</a> people, the imposition (1830) of heavy penalties for harsh treatment of slaves, and finally the emancipation of the slaves in 1834, were measures which combined to aggravate the farmers' dislike of government. Moreover, the inadequate compensation awarded to slave-owners, and the suspicions engendered by the method of payment, caused much resentment; and in 1835 the farmers again removed to unknown country to escape an unloved government. <a href="Emigration">Emigration</a> beyond the colonial border had in fact been continuous for 150 years, but it now took on larger proportions.

Probably the most powerful motive of the <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> was the equality between the black and white races, as proposed by the British. The Boers considered such an equality to be intolerable. This sentiment, which found formal recognition later on in the constitution of the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a>, was held in fullest force by the voortrekkers. The exasperation caused by just grievances unremedied was no stronger a motive with the trekkers than the desire to be free from the restraints imposed on British subjects and the wish to be able to deal with the natives after their own fashion.

The year which witnessed the emancipation of the slaves and the creation of the first treaty state also saw the beginning of <a href="Xhosa%20Wars%23Sixth%20war%20%281834%E2%80%931836%29">another disastrous Frontier war</a>. Fighting began in December 1834, and lasted nearly a year. The <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa</a> wrought great havoc; and Sir <a href="Benjamin%20D%27Urban">Benjamin D'Urban</a>, the governor, in order to secure peace, extended the boundary of the colony to the <a href="Kei%20River">Kei River</a>. The Xhosa had suffered much <a href="injustice">injustice</a>, especially from the <a href="commando">commando</a>-reprisal system, but they had also committed many injustices, and the vacillating policy of the Cape government was largely to blame for the disturbed state of the border. Sir Benjamin's policy ,  which had support of both Dutch and British colonists , was one of close settlement by whites in certain districts and military control of the Bantus in other regions, and it would have done much to ensure peace.

<a href="Lord%20Glenelg">Lord Glenelg</a>, secretary for the colonies in <a href="Lord%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>'s <a href="Second%20Melbourne%20ministry">second administration</a>, held that the Xhosa were in the right in the quarrel, and he compelled D'Urban to abandon the conquered territory, an unwise decision adopted largely on the advice of <a href="John%20Philip%20%28missionary%29">John Philip</a> and his supporters. By 1836 a critical state had arisen in South Africa. The colonists had lost their slaves, the eastern frontier was in a state of insecurity, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Cape%20Colony%20from%201806%20to%201870%231820%20settlers">the British immigrants of 1820</a> were still struggling against heavy odds, and the Dutch colonists were in a state of great indignation.

The <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> occurred between 1835 and the early 1840s. During that period some 12,000 to 14,000 Boers (including women and children), impatient of British rule, emigrated from <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> into the great plains beyond the <a href="Orange%20River">Orange River</a>, and across them again into <a href="Natalia%20Republic">Natal</a> and the vastness of the <a href="Zoutspansberg">Zoutspansberg</a>, in the northern part of the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a>. Those Trekboere who occupied the eastern Cape were semi-nomadic. A significant number in the eastern Cape frontier later became Grensboere ("border farmers") who were the direct ancestors of the <a href="Voortrekkers">Voortrekkers</a>.

Though the Boers accepted British rule without resistance in 1877, they fought two <a href="Boer%20Wars">Boer Wars</a> in the late 19th century to defend their internationally recognised independent countries, the republics of the Transvaal (the <a href="Zuid-Afrikaansche%20Republiek">Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek</a>, or ZAR) and the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a> (OFS), against the threat of annexation by the British Crown.
This led the key figure in organising the resistance, <a href="Paul%20Kruger">Paul Kruger</a>, into conflict with the British.

After the second Anglo-Boer War, a Boer <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a> occurred. Starting in 1903, the largest group emigrated to the <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> region of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Another group emigrated to <a href="Kenya%20Colony">British-ruled Kenya</a>, from where most returned to South Africa during the 1930s, while a third group under the leadership of General <a href="Ben%20Viljoen">Ben Viljoen</a> emigrated to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and to <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Texas">Texas</a> in the southwestern United States.

The Maritz Rebellion (also known as the Boer Revolt, the Five Shilling Rebellion or the Third Boer War) occurred in 1914 at the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, in which men who supported the re-creation of the old <a href="Boer%20republics">Boer republics</a> rose up against the government of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> because they did not want to side with the British against <a href="Germany">Germany</a> so soon after a long bloody war with the British. Many Boers had <a href="Germans">German ancestry</a> and many members of the government were themselves former Boer military leaders who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. The rebellion was put down by <a href="Louis%20Botha">Louis Botha</a> and <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a>, and the ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment. One, <a href="Jopie%20Fourie">Jopie Fourie</a>, was convicted for treason when, as an officer in the <a href="South%20African%20Army">Union Defence Force</a>, he refused to take up arms with the British, and was executed in 1914.

The desire to wander, known as "trekgees", was a notable characteristic of the Boers. It figured prominently in the late 17th century when the Trekboere began to inhabit the northern and eastern Cape frontiers, again during the Great Trek when the Voortrekkers left the eastern Cape "en masse", and after the major republics were established during the Thirstland ("Dorsland") Trek. When one such trekker was asked why he has emigrated he explained, "a drifting spirit was in our hearts, and we ourselves could not understand it. We just sold our farms and set out northwestwards to find a new home."
A rustic characteristic and tradition was developed quite early on as Boer society was born on the frontiers of white settlement and on the outskirts of civilisation.

The separation and declaration of the republics were made out of necessity rather than a personal choice. The Dutch were unwilling to protect the people they abandoned at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>.

The Boer quest for independence manifested in a tradition of declaring republics, which predates the arrival of the British; when the British arrived, Boer republics had already been declared and were in rebellion from the VOC (<a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>).

The Boers of the frontier were known for their independent spirit, resourcefulness, hardiness, and self-sufficiency, whose political notions verged on anarchy but had begun to be influenced by republicanism. Most of the men were also skilled with the use of <a href="gun">gun</a>s as they would hunt and also were able to protect their families with them.

The Boers had cut their ties to Europe as they emerged from the Trekboer group.

The Boers possessed a distinct <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> culture and the majority of Boers and their descendants were members of a <a href="Reformed%20Church">Reformed Church</a>. The <a href="Nederduitsch%20Hervormde%20Kerk">Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk</a> was the national Church of the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a> (1852–1902). The "Orange" in <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a> (1854–1902) was named after the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="House%20of%20Orange">House of Orange</a> in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

The Calvinist influence, in such fundamental Calvinist doctrines such as unconditional <a href="predestination">predestination</a> and <a href="divine%20providence">divine providence</a>, remains present in much of Boer culture, who see their role in society as abiding by the national laws and accepting calamity and hardship as part of their Christian duty.

A small number of Boers may also be members of <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a href="Pentecostal%20movement">Pentecostal</a> or <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran Churches</a>.

During recent times, mainly during the <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> reform and post-1994 eras, some white <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>-speaking people, mainly with "conservative" political views and of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent, have chosen to be called "Boere", rather than "Afrikaners," to distinguish their identity. They believe that many people of <a href="Voortrekker">Voortrekker</a> descent were not assimilated into what they see as the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape</a>-based Afrikaner identity. They suggest that this developed after the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Boer%20War">Second Anglo-Boer War</a> and the subsequent establishment of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> in 1910. Certain Boer nationalists have asserted that they do not identify as a <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> element of the political spectrum.

They contend that the Boers of the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">South African Republic</a> (ZAR) and <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a> republics were recognised as a separate people or cultural group under international law by the <a href="Sand%20River%20Convention">Sand River Convention</a> (which created the South African Republic in 1852), the <a href="Bloemfontein%20Convention">Bloemfontein Convention</a> (which created the Orange Free State Republic in 1854), the <a href="Pretoria%20Convention">Pretoria Convention</a> (which re-established the independence of the South African Republic 1881), the <a href="London%20Convention%20%281884%29">London Convention</a> (which granted the full independence to the South African Republic in 1884), and the <a href="Peace%20of%20Vereeniging">Vereeniging Peace Treaty</a>, which formally ended the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Boer%20War">Second Anglo-Boer War</a> on 31 May 1902. Others contend, however, that these treaties dealt only with agreements between governmental entities and do not imply the recognition of a Boer cultural identity "per se".

The supporters of these views feel that the Afrikaner designation (or label) was used from the 1930s onwards as a means of unifying (politically at least) the white Afrikaans speakers of the Western Cape with those of Trekboer and Voortrekker descent (whose ancestors began migrating eastward during the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century and later northward during the <a href="Great%20Trek">Great Trek</a> of the 1830s) in the north of South Africa, where the Boer Republics were established.

Since the Anglo-Boer war, the term "Boerevolk" was rarely used in the 20th century by the various regimes because of the effort to assimilate the Boerevolk with the Afrikaners. A portion of those who are the descendants of the Boerevolk have reasserted use of this designation.

The supporters of the "Boer" designation view the term "Afrikaner" as an artificial political label which usurped their history and culture, turning "Boer" achievements into "Afrikaner" achievements. They feel that the Western-Cape based Afrikaners – whose ancestors did not trek eastwards or northwards – took advantage of the republican Boers' destitution following the Anglo-Boer War. At that time, the Afrikaners attempted to assimilate the Boers into a new politically based cultural label as "Afrikaners".

In contemporary South Africa, Boer and Afrikaner have often been used interchangeably. The Boers are the smaller segment within the Afrikaner designation, as the Afrikaners of Cape Dutch origin are more numerous. Afrikaner directly translated means "African," and thus refers to all Afrikaans-speaking people in Africa who have their origins in the Cape Colony founded by Jan Van Riebeeck. Boer is the specific group within the larger Afrikaans-speaking population.


The <a href="BCVO">BCVO</a> (Movement for Christian-National Education) is a federation of 47 Calvinist private schools, primarily in the Free State and the Transvaal, committed to educating Boer children from grade 0 through to 12.

Some local Radio stations promote the ideals of those who identify with the Boer people, like <a href="Radio%20Rosestad">Radio Rosestad</a> (in Bloemfontein), <a href="Overvaal%20Stereo">Overvaal Stereo</a> and <a href="Radio%20Pretoria">Radio Pretoria</a>. An internet-based radio station, "<a href="Boerevolk%20Radio">Boerevolk Radio</a>", serves as a mouthpiece for Boer separatists.

Territorial areas in the form of a Boerestaat(Farmer's State) are being developed as settlements exclusively for Boer/Afrikaners, notably <a href="Orania%2C%20Northern%20Cape">Orania</a> in the Northern Cape and <a href="Kleinfontein">Kleinfontein</a> near <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>.

Bronze Star Medal

The Bronze Star Medal, unofficially the Bronze Star, is a <a href="Awards%20and%20decorations%20of%20the%20United%20States%20military">United States decoration</a> awarded to members of the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> for either heroic achievement, heroic service, meritorious achievement, or meritorious service in a combat zone.

Whenever the medal is awarded by the Army and Air Force for acts of valor in combat, the <a href="%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B%20Device">"V" Device</a> is authorized for wear on the medal and whenever the medal is awarded by the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard for acts of valor or meritorious service in combat, the <a href="Combat%20%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B">Combat "V"</a> is authorized for wear on the medal.

Officers from the other <a href="Uniformed%20services%20of%20the%20United%20States">Uniformed Services of the United States</a> are eligible to receive this award, as are foreign soldiers who have served with or alongside a service branch of the United States Armed Forces.

Civilians serving with U.S. military forces in combat are also eligible for the award. For example, <a href="United%20Press%20International">UPI</a> reporter <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Galloway">Joe Galloway</a> was awarded the Bronze Star with <a href="%26quot%3BV%26quot%3B%20Device">"V" Device</a> during the Vietnam War for rescuing a badly wounded soldier under fire in the <a href="Battle%20of%20la%20Drang">Battle of la Drang</a>, in 1965.
The Bronze Star Medal was established by Executive Order 9419, 4 February 1944 (superseded by Executive Order 11046, 24 August 1962, as amended by Executive Order 13286, 28 February 2003).

The Bronze Star Medal may be awarded by the Secretary of a military department or the Secretary of Homeland Security with regard to the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy, or by such military commanders, or other appropriate officers as the Secretary concerned may designate, to any person who, while serving in any capacity in or with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard of the United States, after 6 December 1941, distinguishes, or has distinguished, herself or himself by heroic or meritorious achievement or service, not involving participation in aerial flight—

The acts of heroism are of a lesser degree than required for the award of the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>. The acts of merit or acts of valor must be less than that required for the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> but must nevertheless have been meritorious and accomplished with distinction. The Bronze Star Medal is awarded only to service members in combat zones who are receiving imminent danger pay.

The Bronze Star Medal (without the "V" device) may be awarded to each member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, after 6 December 1941, was cited in orders or awarded a certificate for exemplary conduct in ground combat against an armed enemy between 7 December 1941 and 2 September 1945. For this purpose, the US Army's <a href="Combat%20Infantryman%20Badge">Combat Infantryman Badge</a> or <a href="Combat%20Medical%20Badge">Combat Medical Badge</a> award is considered as a citation in orders. Documents executed since 4 August 1944 in connection with recommendations for the award of decorations of higher degree than the Bronze Star Medal cannot be used as the basis for an award under this paragraph.

Effective 11 September 2001, the <a href="Meritorious%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">Meritorious Service Medal</a> may also be bestowed in lieu of the Bronze Star Medal (without Combat "V" device) for meritorious achievement in a designated combat theater.

The Bronze Star Medal was designed by Rudolf Freund (1878–1960) of the jewelry firm <a href="Bailey%20Banks%20%26amp%3B%20Biddle">Bailey, Banks & Biddle</a>. (Freund also designed the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>.)

The medal is a bronze star in circumscribing diameter. In the center is a diameter superimposed bronze star, the center line of all rays of both stars coinciding. The reverse bears the inscription with a space for the name of the recipient to be engraved. The star hangs from its ribbon by a rectangular metal loop with rounded corners. The suspension ribbon is wide and consists of the following stripes: white 67101; scarlet 67111; white; center stripe ultramarine blue 67118; white; scarlet; and white.

The Bronze Star Medal with the "V" device to denote heroism is the fourth highest military decoration for valor. Although a service member may be cited for heroism in combat and be awarded more than one Bronze Star authorizing the "V" device, only one "V" may be worn on each suspension and <a href="service%20ribbon">service ribbon</a> of the medal. The following ribbon devices must be specifically authorized in the award citation in order to be worn on the Bronze Star Medal, the criteria for and wear of the devices vary between the services:

Colonel <a href="Russell%20Reeder">Russell P. "Red" Reeder</a> conceived the idea of the Bronze Star Medal in 1943; he believed it would aid morale if captains of companies or of batteries could award a medal to deserving people serving under them. Reeder felt another medal was needed as a ground equivalent of the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>, and suggested calling the proposed new award the "Ground Medal". The idea eventually rose through the military bureaucracy and gained supporters. General <a href="George%20C.%20Marshall">George C. Marshall</a>, in a memorandum to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> dated 3 February 1944, wrote 

The Air Medal had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by <a href="Executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">Executive Order</a> 9419 dated 4 February 1944, retroactive to 7 December 1941. This authorization was announced in War Department Bulletin No. 3, dated 10 February 1944.

President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> amended Executive Order 9419 per Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962 to expand the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where US service members become involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a belligerent. At the time of the Executive Order, for example, the US was not a belligerent in Vietnam, so US advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.

Since the award criteria state that the Bronze Star Medal may be awarded to "any person ... while serving in any capacity in or with" the US Armed Forces, awards to members of foreign armed services serving with the United States are permitted. Thus, a number of Allied soldiers received the Bronze Star Medal in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, as well as U.N. soldiers in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Vietnamese and allied forces in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and coalition forces in recent military operations such as the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> and the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. A number of Bronze Star Medals with the "V" device were awarded to veterans of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mogadishu%20%281993%29">Battle of Mogadishu</a>.

As a result of a study conducted in 1947, the policy was implemented that authorized the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal (without the "V" device) to all soldiers who had received the <a href="Combat%20Infantryman%20Badge">Combat Infantryman Badge</a> or the <a href="Combat%20Medical%20Badge">Combat Medical Badge</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The basis for doing this was that the badges were awarded only to soldiers who had borne the hardships which resulted in General Marshall's support of the Bronze Star Medal. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.

In 2012, two female U.S. airmen were allegedly subjected to <a href="cyber-bullying">cyber-bullying</a> after receiving Bronze Star Medals for meritorious non-combat service. The two airmen, who had received the medals in March 2012, had been finance <a href="Non-Commissioned%20Officer%20in%20Charge">NCOICs</a> in medical units deployed to the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>. The awards sparked a debate as to whether or not the Air Force was awarding too many medals to its members, and whether the Bronze Star should be awarded for non-combat service. This prompted the Air Force to take down stories of the two posted to the internet, and to clarify its criteria for awarding medals. The Air Force contended that meritorious service awards of the Bronze Star outnumber valor awards, and that it views awards on a case-by-case basis to maintain the integrity of the award.

This is not the first time that the USAF has been criticized for offering this award. The Department of Defense investigated the award of the Bronze Star Medal (BSM) by the USAF to some 246 individuals after operations in Kosovo in 1999. All but 60 were awarded to officers, and only 16 of those awarded were actually in the combat zone. At least five were awarded to officers who never left <a href="Whiteman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Whiteman Air Force Base</a> in Missouri. During this campaign, the Navy had awarded 69 BSMs, and the Army with 5,000 troops in neighboring Albania (considered part of the combat zone) awarded none. In the end, there was a Pentagon review and decision by Congress in 2001 to stop the awarding of Bronze Stars to personnel outside the combat zone.

Ballarat

Ballarat is a city located on the <a href="Yarrowee%20River">Yarrowee River</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Victoria%29">Central Highlands</a> of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The city is approximately west-north-west of the state capital, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, with a population of some 101,686. It is the third largest population for an inland city in Australia. Locals are known as 'Ballaratians'.

Ballarat is arguably the most significant Victorian era gold rush boomtown in Australia. Just months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, the <a href="Victorian%20gold%20rush">Victorian gold rush</a> transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement. Gold was discovered at <a href="Golden%20Point%2C%20Victoria">Poverty Point</a> on 18 August 1851, and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted. Within months, migrants from across the world had rushed to the district in search of gold. Unlike many other gold boom towns, the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades, which can be evidenced to this day in the city's rich architecture.

The <a href="Eureka%20Rebellion">Eureka Rebellion</a> began in Ballarat, and the only armed rebellion in <a href="Australian%20history">Australian history</a>, the Battle of Eureka Stockade, took place on 3 December 1854. In response to the event the first male <a href="suffrage%20in%20Australia">suffrage in Australia</a> was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of <a href="democracy%20in%20Australia">democracy in Australia</a>. The gold rush and boom gave birth to many other significant cultural legacies. The rebellion's symbol, the <a href="Eureka%20Flag">Eureka Flag</a>, has become a national symbol and is held at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Australian%20Democracy%20at%20Eureka">Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka</a> in Ballarat. Other nationally significant heritage structures include the <a href="Ballarat%20Botanical%20Gardens">Ballarat Botanical Gardens</a> (established 1857), with the greatest concentration of public statuary, the official <a href="Prime%20Ministers%20Avenue">Prime Ministers Avenue</a>, the longest running lyric theatre building (Her Majesty's Theatre, established 1875), the first <a href="http%3A//observatory.ballarat.net/">municipal observatory</a>, established 1886, and the earliest and longest war memorial avenue (the <a href="Avenue%20of%20Honour">Avenue of Honour</a>, established between 1917 and 1919).

Proclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a> rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a>. It is the commercial capital of the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Victoria%29">Central Highlands</a> and the largest city in the <a href="Goldfields%20region%20of%20Victoria">Goldfields region of Victoria</a>, as well a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of <a href="Ballarat%20East">Ballarat East</a> in 1921, ending a long standing rivalry.

Prior to the <a href="European%20settlement%20of%20Australia">European settlement of Australia</a>, the Ballarat region was populated by the <a href="Wathaurong">Wathaurong</a> people, an <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> people. The Boro gundidj tribe's territory was based along the Yarrowee River.

The first Europeans to sight the area were an 1837 party of six mostly Scottish squatters from Geelong, led by Somerville Learmonth, who were in search of land less affected by the severe drought for their sheep to graze. The party scaled <a href="Mount%20Buninyong">Mount Buninyong</a>; among them were Somerville's brother <a href="Thomas%20Livingstone%20Learmonth">Thomas Livingstone Learmonth</a>, William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.

The Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area "Ballaarat" Some claim the name is derived from a local <a href="Wathaurong">Wathaurong</a> <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Aboriginal</a> word for the area, "balla arat". The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean "resting place". In some dialects, "balla" means "bent elbow", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and "arat" meaning "place". Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of Noah's ark. The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.

The first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by <a href="Thomas%20Hiscock">Thomas Hiscock</a> on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south. The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces. Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings. Yields were particularly high, with the first prospectors in the area extracting between half an ounce (which was more than the average wage of the time) and up to five ounces of alluvial gold per day. As news of the <a href="Australian%20gold%20rushes">Australian gold rushes</a> reached the world, Ballarat gained an international reputation as a particularly rich goldfield. As a result, a huge influx of immigrants occurred, including many from Ireland and China, gathering in a collection of prospecting <a href="shanty%20town">shanty town</a>s around the creeks and hills. In just a few months numerous alluvial runs were established, several deep mining leads began, and the population had swelled to over 1,000 people. 

The first post office opened on 1 November 1851. It was the first Victorian post office to open in a gold-mining settlement. Parts of the district were first surveyed by <a href="William%20Urquhart">William Urquhart</a> as early as October 1851. By 1852 his <a href="grid%20plan">grid plan</a> and wide streets for land sales in the new township of West Ballarat, built upon a <a href="plateau">plateau</a> of <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, contrasted markedly with the existing narrow unplanned streets, tents, and gullies of the original East Ballarat settlement. The new town's main streets of the time were named in honour of <a href="police%20commissioner">police commissioner</a>s and <a href="gold%20commissioner">gold commissioner</a>s of the time, with the main street, Sturt Street, named after <a href="Evelyn%20Pitfield%20Shirley%20Sturt">Evelyn Pitfield Shirley Sturt</a>; Dana Street named after <a href="Henry%20Dana">Henry Dana</a>; Lydiard Street after his assistant; Doveton Street after Francis Crossman Doveton, Ballarat's first gold commissioner; Armstrong after David Armstrong; and Mair Street after William Mair. These officials were based at the government encampment (after which nearby Camp Street was named), which was strategically positioned on an escarpment with an optimal view over the district's diggings.

The first newspaper, "The Banner", published on 11 September 1853, was one of many to be distributed during the gold-rush period. Print media played a large role in the early history of the settlement. Ballarat attracted a sizable number of miners from the Californian 1848 gold rush, and some were known as Ballafornians.
Civil disobedience in Ballarat led to Australia's only armed civil uprising, the <a href="Eureka%20Rebellion">Eureka Rebellion</a> (colloquially referred to as the "Eureka Stockade") which took place in Ballarat on 3 December 1854. The event, in which 22 miners were killed, is considered to be a defining moment in Australian history.

The city earned the nickname "The Golden City" in the 1850s. The gold rush population peaked at almost 60,000, mostly male diggers, by 1858. However the early population was largely itinerant. As quickly as the alluvial deposits drew prospectors to Ballarat, the rate of gold extraction fluctuated and, as they were rapidly worked dry, many quickly moved to rush other fields as new findings were announced, particularly <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Mount Alexander</a> in 1852, <a href="Beaufort%2C%20Victoria">Fiery Creek</a> in 1855, and <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a> in 1857. By 1859, a smaller number of permanent settlers numbering around 23,000, many of whom had built personal wealth in gold, established a prosperous economy based around a shift to <a href="Underground%20mining%20%28hard%20rock%29">deep underground gold mining</a>.

Confidence of the city's early citizens in the enduring future of their city is evident in the sheer scale of many of the early public buildings, generous public recreational spaces, and opulence of many of its commercial establishments and private housing. A local steam locomotive industry developed from 1854 with the Phoenix Foundry operating until 1906. The railway came to the town with the opening of the <a href="Geelong-Ballarat%20railway%20line">Geelong–Ballarat line</a> in 1862 and Ballarat developed as a major railway town. As the city grew the region's original indigenous inhabitants were quickly expelled to the fringe and by 1867 few remained.

From the late 1860s to the early 20th century, Ballarat made a successful transition from a gold rush town to an industrial-age city. The ramshackle tents and timber buildings gradually made way for permanent buildings, many impressive structures of solid stone and brick mainly built from wealth generated by early mining.

<a href="Prince%20Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a> visited between 9 and 13 December 1867 and as the first royal visit, the occasion was met with great fanfare. The Prince Room was prepared at Craigs Royal Hotel for his stay. The city's first civic centre—Prince Alfred Hall—erected over the Yarrowee between the two municipalities, was named in his honour during his visit. The later attempt of the Prince's assassination by Ballaratian <a href="Henry%20James%20O%27Farrell">Henry James O'Farrell</a> was met with shock and great horror from locals.

Ballarat was proclaimed a city in 1871. Gong Gong reservoir was built in 1877 to alleviate flooding and to provide a permanent water supply. A <a href="Serviceton%20railway%20line">direct railway to Melbourne</a> was completed in December 1889. Many industries and workshops had been established as a result of manufacturing and servicing for the deep lead mining industry.

Local <a href="boosterism">boosterists</a> at the start of the 20th century adopted the nickname "<a href="Athens">Athens</a> of Australia", first used to describe the city by the prestigious Irish-Australian jurist and politician of the early 20th century <a href="John%20Madden%20%28jurist%29">Sir John Madden</a>.

On 13 May 1901, the <a href="George%20V">Duke of York (later George V)</a> and his wife, <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary</a> the Duchess of York, travelled by train from Melbourne to Ballarat.

The first electricity supply was completed in 1901 by the Electric Supply Company of Victoria. A bluestone power station was built at the corner of Ripon Street and Wendouree Parade in 1901 with the main aim of providing the power required for electrification of the city's tramway network.

Following the start of the 20th century, however, mining activity slowed and Ballarat's growth all but stopped—the city went into a period of decline and saw a reversal of the fortunes acquired in the previous century.

The <a href="Sunshine%20rail%20disaster">Sunshine rail disaster</a> in 1908 resulted in the death of dozens of Ballarat residents. On 19 August 1909, a great storm lashed the city, resulting in the death of one person and injury of seven others. During the storm, a tornado swept across the city's northern and eastern suburbs destroying numerous homes in <a href="Ballarat%20North%2C%20Victoria">Ballarat North</a>, <a href="Soldiers%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Soldiers Hill</a>, <a href="Black%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Black Hill</a> and <a href="Ballarat%20East%2C%20Victoria">Ballarat East</a>, lifting and then again touching down at <a href="Eureka%2C%20Victoria">Eureka</a> where it destroyed more homes before dissipating.

One bright spot in this period was the establishment of Osrey Pottery in 1922 by the artist <a href="Gladys%20Reynell">Gladys Reynell</a>, one of Australia's first potters, and her husband, George Samuel Osborne. The pottery closed in 1926 when Osborne developed lead poisoning.

Ballarat's significant representation during WWI resulted in heavy human loss. The city eventually lost first provincial status to Geelong. In response, local lobbyists continually pushed the Victorian government for <a href="decentralisation">decentralisation</a>, the greatest success being the <a href="Victorian%20Railways">Victorian Railways</a> opening the <a href="Ballarat%20North%20Workshops">Ballarat North Workshops</a> in April 1917. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> proved a further setback for Ballarat, with the closure of many institutions and causing the worst unemployment in the city's history, with over a thousand people in the dole queue.

The city's two municipalities, Ballarat East and West Town Councils, finally amalgamated in 1921 to form the City of Ballarat.

While deep, the depression was also brief. The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, <a href="Ballarat%20Airport">Ballarat Airport</a> was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city. During World War II an expanded Ballarat airport was the base of the <a href="RAAF">RAAF</a> Wireless Air Gunners' School as well as the base for <a href="USAAF">USAAF</a> Liberator bomber squadrons. In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line. Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.

In the <a href="post-war">post-war</a> era, Ballarat's growth continued. In response to an acute housing shortage, significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive <a href="Housing%20Commission%20of%20Victoria">Housing Commission of Victoria</a> estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as <a href="Wendouree%20West%2C%20Victoria">Wendouree West</a>). The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.

The 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics, and work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission. The first <a href="Begonia%20Festival">Begonia Festival</a>, a highly successful community celebration, was held in 1953. <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> visited on 8 March 1954. The Civic Centre, Prince Alfred Hall had burned down suspiciously that year; however a new Civic Hall was constructed and opened in March 1955. On 23 November 1956, the Olympic torch was carried through the city, and the following day the rowing events were held at the lake. On 2 March 1958 the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Mother</a> visited Ballarat.

During the following decades, the city saw increased threats to its heritage. In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings. By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of <a href="Sovereign%20Hill">Sovereign Hill</a>, the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.

During the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of <a href="Wendouree%2C%20Victoria">Wendouree</a> closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.

The city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.

During <a href="World%20War%202">World War 2</a>, Ballarat was the location of <a href="List%20of%20RAAF%20inland%20aircraft%20fuel%20depots">RAAF No.1 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD)</a>, completed in 1942 in the defence of Australia against a Japanese invasion and de-commissioned on 29 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the <a href="RAAF">RAAF</a> and the <a href="US%20Army%20Air%20Forces">US Army Air Forces</a> at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

Ballarat lies at the foothills of the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a> in Central Western Victoria. Also known as the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Victoria%29">Central Highlands</a>, it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.

Geologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil. Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.

There are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of <a href="Lake%20Wendouree">Lake Wendouree</a> which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large <a href="Lake%20Burrumbeet">Lake Burrumbeet</a> wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.

The contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately of the local government area's . Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban. From the city centre this area extends approximately north to the hills around Invermay, approximately east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately west along the plains to Lucas and approximately south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong. The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs. The reach of the Yarrowee River toward Ballarat Central becomes a stormwater drain and is completely covered over as it flows under the CBD.

Ballarat is a primarily low-rise city though apart from the area around Ballarat Airport there are few established height limits for buildings. The City of Ballarat defines two <a href="activity%20centre">Major Activity Centre</a>s within the urban area – the Central Business District (CBD) and Wendouree with a high concentration of business, retail and community function based primarily on the <a href="Melbourne%202030">Melbourne 2030</a> planning model and a further 11 neighbourhood activity centres. The tallest building in urban Ballarat is the seven-storey Henry Bolte wing of the Ballarat Base Hospital (1994). Beyond the central area, urban Ballarat extends into several suburban areas with a mixture of housing styles. Predominant styles are 19th-century villas, Victorian terraces, Federation homes and <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> red brick homes. Settlement patterns around Ballarat consist of small villages and country towns, some with less than a few thousand people.

The Central Business District (located in <a href="Ballarat%20Central">Ballarat Central</a>) is a large mixed-use office and retail district bounded to the north by railway lines, to the west by Drummond Street, to the south to Grant street and to the east by Princes Street and spanning the floodplain of the Yarrowee River. Lydiard, Sturt Streets, Armstrong, Doveton, Dana Street and Bridge Street (known as Bridge Mall) along with the historic centre of East Ballarat—Main Street and Bakery Hill have retained stands of commercial and civic buildings of state and national heritage significance.

The inner established suburbs were initially laid out around the key mining areas and include <a href="Ballarat%20East%2C%20Victoria">Ballarat East</a>, <a href="Bakery%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Bakery Hill</a>, <a href="Golden%20Point%2C%20Victoria">Golden Point</a>, <a href="Soldiers%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Soldiers Hill</a>, <a href="Black%20Hill%2C%20Ballarat">Black Hill</a>, <a href="Brown%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Brown Hill</a>, <a href="Eureka%2C%20Victoria">Eureka</a>, <a href="Canadian%2C%20Victoria">Canadian</a>, <a href="Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20Victoria">Mount Pleasant</a>, <a href="Redan%2C%20Victoria">Redan</a>, <a href="Sebastopol%2C%20Victoria">Sebastopol</a> and <a href="Newington%2C%20Victoria">Newington</a>.

The post gold rush era has seen a boom in expansion, extending the <a href="conurbation">conurbation</a> north, south and west. To the west, Ballarat has expanded West to <a href="Lucas%2C%20Victoria">Lucas</a>, <a href="Alfredton%2C%20Victoria">Alfredton</a>, <a href="Delacombe%2C%20Victoria">Delacombe</a> To The North West <a href="Wendouree%2C%20Victoria">Wendouree</a> , Wendouree West and <a href="Miners%20Rest%2C%20Victoria">Miners Rest</a> To the north it has expanded to <a href="Ballarat%20North%2C%20Victoria">Ballarat North</a>, <a href="Invermay%20Park%2C%20Victoria">Invermay Park</a>, <a href="Invermay%2C%20Victoria">Invermay, Victoria</a> Invermay and <a href="Nerrina%2C%20Victoria">Nerrina</a>; to the east to <a href="Warrenheip%2C%20Victoria">Warrenheip</a> and south to <a href="Sebastopol%2C%20Victoria">Sebastopol</a>, <a href="Mount%20Clear%2C%20Victoria">Mount Clear</a> and <a href="Mount%20Helen%2C%20Victoria">Mount Helen</a> with the urban area encroaching the large town of <a href="Buninyong%2C%20Victoria">Buninyong</a>.

Wendouree is currently the only major suburban activity centre with a large indoor shopping mall—Stockland Shopping Centre (expanded in 2007) and also has a number of surrounding retail parks including a strip shopping centre along Howitt Street including the large retail chain <a href="Harvey%20Norman">Harvey Norman</a>. Elsewhere are small suburban hubs with supermarkets such as <a href="IGA%20%28supermarkets%29">IGA (supermarkets)</a> and small stretches of shopfronts.

Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat does not have a defined urban growth boundary. This has put continuing pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major greenfield land development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward <a href="Bonshaw%2C%20Victoria">Bonshaw</a>, <a href="Smythes%20Creek%2C%20Victoria">Smythes Creek</a> and <a href="Cardigan%2C%20Victoria">Cardigan</a> with a new suburb to be known as <a href="Lucas%2C%20Victoria">Lucas</a> to be created. New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.

Ballarat has a moderate oceanic climate (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Cfb") with four seasons. Its elevation, at above sea level, causes its mean monthly temperatures to tend to be on average below those of Melbourne. The mean daily maximum temperature for January is , while the mean minimum is . In July, the mean maximum is ; average July minimum is . Ballarat has 55.2 clear days annually.

The mean annual rainfall is , with August being the wettest month (). There are an average of 198 rain-free days per year. Like much of Australia, Ballarat experiences cyclical drought and heavy rainfall. Flooding of the Yarrowee catchment occurs occasionally. In 1869 a serious flood of the Yarrowee River put most of the lower section of business district including Bridge and Grenville streets under water and caused the loss of two lives. Prolonged drought (an average annual rainfall with falls averaging as low as per year since 2001) caused Lake Wendouree to dry up completely for the first time in its history between 2006 and 2007. More recently higher rainfall levels have been recorded including in the 24 hours to 9 am on 14 January 2011, ending a four-day period of flooding rains across much of Victoria and Tasmania, and contributing to the wettest January on record, with a total of of rain for the month.

Light snowfall typically falls on nearby Mount Buninyong and Mount Warrenheip at least once a year but in the urban area only during heavy winters. Widespread frosts and fog are more common during the cooler months. Snow has been known to fall heavily. Heavy snow seasons occurred in 1900–1902 and 1905–1907 (with record falls in 1906), and moderate snow seasons were recorded during the 1940s and 1980s. Recent snowfalls to have occurred within the urban area were in 2006, 2008, 2014 and 2016, with falls in November 2006 (light, also the latest snowfall on record), July 2007 (heavy), June 2008 (light), August 2008 (light), August 2014 (moderate) and June 2016 (light).

Ballarat's highest maximum recorded temperature was on 7 February 2009 during the <a href="Early%202009%20southeastern%20Australia%20heat%20wave">2009 southeastern Australia heat wave</a>. This was above the previous record of , set on 25 January 2003. The lowest-ever recorded minimum was at sunrise on 19 July 2015.

Ballarat has a healthy environment in comparison to Melbourne; however, as a growing regional city there are issues including <a href="pollution">pollution</a>, <a href="waterway">waterway</a> health and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. Air quality is generally good, however dust is sometimes an issue in the summer months and woodsmoke from <a href="fireplace">fireplace</a>s is an issue in the winter months. Ballarat's waterways have historically been affected by heavy pollution from both mining and industry.

The Ballarat Environment Network formed in 1993 to provide a voice for environmental and <a href="nature%20conservation">nature conservation</a> issues in Ballarat and its surroundings. Another large lobby group for <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a> in the city is the Ballarat Renewable Energy And Zero Emissions (BREAZE) formed in 2006. The City of Ballarat released an Environment Sustainability Strategy for the city in 2007.

While there are no national parks in Ballarat's proximity, Ballarat is bordered by extensive bushland to the north, south and south west and sensitive <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> to the east. There are a number of nearby state parks and large reserves including the <a href="Enfield%20State%20Park">Enfield State Park</a>, <a href="Creswick%20Regional%20Park">Creswick Regional Park</a>, <a href="Mount%20Warrenheip">Mount Warrenheip</a> Flora Reserve, <a href="Mount%20Buninyong">Mount Buninyong</a> Reserve and <a href="Lake%20Burrumbeet">Lake Burrumbeet</a> park. The region is home to a large <a href="koala">koala</a> population with protected areas established in the city's outer southern and eastern settlements.

Many parts of urban Ballarat have been affected by the introduction of exotic species, particularly introduced flora. <a href="Common%20gorse">Common gorse</a> is one such problem which has prompted the formation of an official Ballarat Region Gorse Task Force in 1999 to control. <a href="European%20rabbit">European rabbit</a>s and <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es cause significant environmental damage in the region's agriculture areas.

The economy of Ballarat is driven by all three <a href="economic%20sector">economic sector</a>s, though contemporary Ballarat has emerged as a primarily <a href="service%20economy">service economy</a> with its main industry being the <a href="service%20industry">service industry</a> and its key areas of business including <a href="tourism">tourism</a>, <a href="hospitality">hospitality</a>, <a href="retail">retail</a>, <a href="professional%20services">professional services</a>, government administration and <a href="education">education</a>. <a href="Secondary%20industry">Secondary industry</a> including <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, which had grown in the 20th century remains an important sector. The city's historic <a href="primary%20industry">primary industry</a> roots including <a href="mining">mining</a> and <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> continue to play a role, though one that has declined since the 20th century. Industries emerging this century include <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> service sector and <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>.

As a major service centre for the populous goldfields region, Ballarat has large sectors of employment in business including retail, professional services and <a href="tradespeople">trades</a> as well as state and federal government branch offices for <a href="public%20services">public services</a> and <a href="health%20care">health care</a> and <a href="Non-governmental%20organization">non-government</a> <a href="service%20organisation">service organisation</a>s. Collectively these industries employ more than half of the city's workforce and generate the bulk of the city's economic activity.

Ballarat is the main retail economy in the region. The city has several key retail districts including a <a href="pedestrian%20mall">pedestrian mall</a> known as Bridge Mall comprising over 100 traders. There are also indoor shopping malls including <a href="Central%20Square%2C%20Ballarat">Central Square Shopping Centre</a> and <a href="Stockland%20Wendouree">Stockland Wendouree</a>. better known as Wendouree Village, with a large number of <a href="specialty%20store">specialty store</a>s. Major department stores include <a href="Myer">Myer</a>, <a href="Target%20Australia">Target</a>, <a href="Big%20W">Big W</a>, <a href="Kmart">Kmart</a>, <a href="Harvey%20Norman">Harvey Norman</a> and <a href="Harris%20Scarfe">Harris Scarfe</a>. Additionally each of the major supermarkets (<a href="Coles%20Supermarkets">Coles</a>, <a href="Woolworths%20%28supermarket%29">Woolworths</a>, <a href="IGA%20%28Australian%20supermarket%20group%29">IGA</a> and <a href="Aldi">Aldi</a>) are represented. Servicing the financial sector are branches of the <a href="Big%20Four%20%28banks%29">big four</a> Australian retail banks (<a href="National%20Australia%20Bank">National Australia Bank</a>, <a href="Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Banking%20Group">Australia and New Zealand Banking Group</a>, <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank">Commonwealth Bank</a> and <a href="Westpac">Westpac</a>) along with <a href="Bendigo%20Bank">Bendigo Bank</a> and <a href="St.George%20Bank">St.George Bank</a> and a number of smaller independent financial services firms.

<a href="Federation%20University%20Australia">Federation University Australia</a> exports education through a large international students program and throughout Australia through <a href="distance%20education">distance education</a> programs.

In recent years, a large technology park, the Ballarat Technology Park with communications centre has been established, with tenants including <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and employing over 1,400 people.

Ballarat attracts 2.2 million visitors a year and the tourism and hospitality industry is a <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>480 million a year sector which accounts for around 15% of Ballarat's economy and employs around 2,870 people. Tourism in Ballarat is promoted by <a href="Ballarat%20Regional%20Tourism">Ballarat Regional Tourism</a>.

A significant <a href="heritage%20tourism">heritage tourism</a> industry has not grown substantially in Ballarat since the 1960s. Ballarat is most notable for the award-winning <a href="open-air%20museum">open-air museum</a> known as <a href="Sovereign%20Hill">Sovereign Hill</a>, a recreated 1850s gold mining settlement opened in 1970. Sovereign Hill is Ballarat's biggest tourism drawcard and is consistently rated among one of the best outdoor museums in the world and continues to expand. Sovereign Hill accounts for over half a million of Ballarat's visitors and $40 million in tourism revenue.

Several businesses and attractions have capitalised on Ballarat's gold mining history. They include <a href="Kryal%20Castle">Kryal Castle</a> (1972), "Gold Rush Mini Golf" (2002) featuring the "Big Miner" (2006) one of <a href="Australia%27s%20big%20things">Australia's big things</a> (although the original proposal appeared larger and for the miner to hold the Eureka Flag) at Ballarat's eastern entrance.

Other tourist attractions include the <a href="Eureka%20Centre">Eureka Centre</a>; <a href="The%20Gold%20Museum%2C%20Ballarat">The Gold Museum, Ballarat</a>; Ballarat Botanic gardens and Lake Wendouree; the Museum of Australian Democracy; the <a href="Ballarat%20Tramway%20Museum">Ballarat Tramway Museum</a> and <a href="http%3A//www.eerietours.com.au/">Ballarat Ghost Tours</a> and <a href="Ballarat%20Wildlife%20Park">Ballarat Wildlife Park</a>. A large number of Ballarat hotels, motels and restaurants service the tourism industry. The Ballarat Tourist Association is an industry based non-profit, membership organisation representing the city's tourism industry.

According to the 2006 Australian Census, manufacturing is Ballarat's third largest employment sector, accounting for 14.8% of all workers.

Ballarat attracts investment from several international manufacturers. The Australian headquarters of <a href="Mars%2C%20Incorporated">Mars, Incorporated</a> was established in Ballarat in 1979 with the main Ballarat factory producing popular confectionery including <a href="Mars%20bar">Mars bar</a>s, <a href="Snickers">Snickers</a> and <a href="M%26amp%3BM%27s">M&M's</a> for the Australian market as well as expanding in 2013 to produce <a href="Maltesers">Maltesers</a>. <a href="McCain%20Foods%20Limited">McCain Foods Limited</a> Australian headquarters was established in Ballarat in 1970 and the company continues to expand its operations. The <a href="Ballarat%20North%20Workshops">Ballarat North Workshops</a> is a major manufacturer of public transportation products with current investment from <a href="Alstom">Alstom</a>.

Ballarat also has a large number of home-grown companies producing textiles, general industrial engineering, food products, brick and tiles, building components, prefabricated housing components and automotive components. <a href="Brewing">Brewing</a> was once a large-scale operation, with many large businesses including the public company Phoenix Brewery, and although large-scale brewing has ceased, the city retains a substantial <a href="microbrewery">microbrewery</a> industry.

Though historically an important sector, the production of Ballarat's primary industry declined for many decades, recovering only marginally since 2006. Where historically the mining industry supported tens of thousands of workers or the majority of the population, today agriculture dominates the sector, though collectively both industries employ less than thousand people or just over 2% of the City of Ballarat's total workforce.

Ballarat rose to prominence as a goldrush boomtown, though gold no longer plays a pivotal role in the economy of the city. Nevertheless, deep underground mining continues to the present date with a single main mine operating. There are still thought to be large, undiscovered gold reserves in the Ballarat region, with investigations being made by local and national companies. <a href="Lihir%20Gold">Lihir Gold</a> invested in Ballarat Goldfields in 2006, however it downscaled its operations in 2009 due to the expense of extraction before selling its stake in 2010 to Castlemaine Goldfields. Along with gold, lignite (coal), kaolin (clay) and iron ore have also been mined in the Ballarat region and nearby <a href="Lal%20Lal">Lal Lal</a> however many of the resource deposits have since been exhausted. An active quarrying industry with large enterprises including <a href="Boral%20Limited">Boral Limited</a> extracts and manufactures building materials from the Ballarat region, including clays, aggregates, cements, asphalts.

Approximately half () of the municipality's area is rural with optimal conditions for agriculture including rich volcanic soils and climate. This area is used primarily for agriculture and animal husbandry and generates more than $37 million in commodities. The region supports an active potato growing industry that has supplied local food manufacturers including McCain, though more recently has been threatened by cheaper imports. Other large crops include grains, vegetables, grapes and berries. Cattle and poultry stocks, including sheep, cows and pigs, support an active local meat and dairy industry. The Ballarat Livestock Selling Centre is the largest cattle exchange in regional Victoria. The Ballarat Agricultural and Pastoral Society formed in 1856 and has run the Ballarat Show annually since 1859.

A $7.5 million forestry industry is active in nearby state forests as well as on a small scale in the urban area along the Canadian Valley around the suburbs of Mt Clear and Mt Helen areas with pine plantations and sawmill operations.

The Ballarat region has a rapidly growing renewable energy industry, in particular due to its abundant wind energy, attracting significant investment and generating revenue for local landholders and local councils. The region is also a source of bountiful geothermal energy, solar power and biomass although to date, only its wind, solar and hydroelectricity has been harvested commercially. All local commercially produced electricity is sent to the <a href="National%20Electricity%20Market">National Electricity Market</a>.

Wind energy is generated by local wind farms. The largest, <a href="Waubra%20Wind%20Farm">Waubra Wind Farm</a>, completed in 2009, ( W – 192 MW, 128 turbines) is capable of producing enough electricity to power a city 3 to 4 times the size of Ballarat. Other significant nearby wind farms include <a href="Mount%20Mercer%20Wind%20Farm">Mount Mercer</a>, completed 2014, ( S – 131 MW, 64 turbines) which produces enough energy to power 100,000 homes, equivalent to Ballarat's population and Chepstowe, completed March 2015, ( W – 6 MW, 3 turbines) which produces enough power for 3,400 homes. The first community-owned wind farm in Australia, the <a href="Hepburn%20Wind%20Project">Hepburn Wind Project</a> at <a href="Leonards%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Leonards Hill</a>, completed in 2011, ( NE – 4 MW, 2 turbines) produces the equivalent amount of electricity used by the town of <a href="Daylesford%2C%20Victoria">Daylesford</a>. Several large projects have planning approval, including <a href="Stockyard%20Hill%20Wind%20Farm">Stockyard Hill Wind Farm</a> ( W – 41 MW, 157 turbines), Moorabool Wind Project at <a href="Mount%20Egerton%2C%20Victoria">Mount Egerton</a> and <a href="Ballan%2C%20Victoria">Ballan</a> ( E – 330 MW, 107 turbines). and the <a href="Lal%20Lal%2C%20Victoria">Lal Lal</a> Wind Farm ( SE – 150 MW, 64 turbines).

Hydroelectricity is generated at White Swan reservoir micro hydro plant established in 2008 and producing the equivalent electricity needs of around 370 homes. Ballarat Solar Park, opened in 2009 at the Airport site in Mitchell Park, is Victoria's first ground-mounted, flat-plate and grid-connected photovoltaic farm. Built by <a href="Sharp%20Corporation">Sharp Corporation</a> for <a href="Origin%20Energy">Origin Energy</a>, it is and generates the equivalent electricity needs of around 150 homes.

The 2006 Australian national census indicated that the permanent population of the urban area was 78,221 out of the City of Ballarat's population of 85,196 and a total of 31,960 households.

Ballarat has witnessed a significant growth surge since 2006 and the population of the City of Ballarat is becoming increasingly urban such that statistically, the LGA is now used as the ABS statistical division. Recent rapid growth has been attributed by demographers to increased commuter activity arising from surging house and land prices in Melbourne coupled with transport upgrades between Ballarat and Melbourne. Since 2006 Ballarat has averaged an annual population growth of 1700 and in June 2008 the estimated resident population of the City of Ballarat was 91,787. In August 2009 this population had grown to 94,000.

While most of the city's population can trace their ethnic roots to Anglo-Celtic descent, 8.2% of the population are born overseas. Of them, the majority (4.2%) come from <a href="Northern%20Europe">North East Europe</a>. 3.4% speak a language other than English. 14.4% of the population is over the age of 65. The median age in Ballarat is 35.8 years.

"...and in Ballarat, Victoria, a Tonight show ("Six Tonight") was carving its name into Australian television history. The show, hosted by Fred Fargher, ran for 13 years, and managed to attract many of the top name entertainers in the world, simply by offering them a limo ride to this beautiful country centre, a no-pressure spot on the show, and then a great dinner afterwards at one of the city's excellent restaurants. The sheer bravado of the offer enticed some of show business' biggest names".

Ballarat has inspired many <a href="visual%20art">visual art</a>ists. <a href="Eugene%20von%20Guerard">Eugene von Guerard</a> documented the city's establishment as a gold digging settlement, while <a href="Albert%20Henry%20Fullwood">Albert Henry Fullwood</a> and <a href="Knut%20Bull">Knut Bull</a> depicted the city's boom era streetscapes. Ballarat features prominently in literature and fiction, including "<a href="The%20Boscombe%20Valley%20Mystery">The Boscombe Valley Mystery</a>", a short story from <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes">The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</a>" (1891); "<a href="King%20Billy%20of%20Ballarat%20and%20Other%20Stories">King Billy of Ballarat and Other Stories</a>" (1892) by <a href="Morley%20Roberts">Morley Roberts</a>; "<a href="The%20Fortunes%20of%20Richard%20Mahony">The Fortunes of Richard Mahony</a>" (1917) by <a href="Henry%20Handel%20Richardson">Henry Handel Richardson</a>; "<a href="Murder%20on%20the%20Ballarat%20Train">Murder on the Ballarat Train</a>" (1993) by <a href="Kerry%20Greenwood">Kerry Greenwood</a>; and "<a href="Illywhacker">Illywhacker</a>" (1985) by <a href="Peter%20Carey%20%28novelist%29">Peter Carey</a>.

Ballarat is also a popular filming location. Australia's second oldest feature film, "<a href="Eureka%20Stockade%20%281907%20film%29">Eureka Stockade</a>" (1907), is the first in a line of films about the historic Ballarat event. The city makes cameos in "<a href="Dogs%20in%20Space">Dogs in Space</a>" (1986), "<a href="My%20Brother%20Jack">My Brother Jack</a>" (2001), "<a href="Ned%20Kelly%20%282003%20film%29">Ned Kelly</a>" (2003) and "The Writer" (2005). The television series "<a href="The%20Doctor%20Blake%20Mysteries">The Doctor Blake Mysteries</a>" (2012–) is set in Ballarat and also mostly shot there.

Two ships of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> have been named <a href="HMAS%20Ballarat">HMAS Ballarat</a> after the city, <a href="HMAS%20Ballarat%20%28J184%29">HMAS Ballarat (J184)</a> and <a href="HMAS%20Ballarat%20%28FFH%20155%29">HMAS Ballarat (FFH 155)</a>.

A great many notable people's origins are in the Ballarat region, with the most prominent being high-ranking politicians and sportspeople.

Several former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">prime ministers of Australia</a> were either born in or lived in Ballarat, and this was recognised by the city's Prime Minister's Avenue. <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a>, the second prime minister, was the first federal parliament MP for Ballarat. Sir <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, and <a href="James%20Scullin">James Scullin</a> were both educated in Ballarat. <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> was born in nearby Creswick and his wife Elsie was born in Ballarat. Several <a href="premiers%20of%20the%20Australian%20states">premiers of the Australian states</a> were born in Ballarat, including Ballarat born Sir <a href="Henry%20Bolte">Henry Bolte</a>, <a href="Steve%20Bracks">Steve Bracks</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hollway">Thomas Hollway</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Daglish">Henry Daglish</a>. Additionally <a href="Duncan%20Gillies">Duncan Gillies</a> lived in and represented Ballarat in the <a href="Victorian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Victorian Legislative Assembly</a> before becoming state premier.

An additional political activist included Francis William Hyet is trade unionist and born in Ballarat. He was heavily inclined towards socialism which became a calling for his way of life. He became involved with the Social Democratic Party in 1905 and following the Victorian Socialist Party in 1906. Hyett was a very prominent in the anti-conscription campaign. He was able to harness the union's newspaper which became a medium for the anti-conscriptionists.

Outside politics other prominent public figures include <a href="Peter%20Lalor">Peter Lalor</a>, a notable historical figure in Australia as the leader of the Eureka Rebellion (1854) and a parliamentarian; the inventor <a href="George%20Alfred%20Julius">George Alfred Julius</a>, who spent part of his childhood there when his father was a local Anglican cleric; the inventor <a href="Henry%20Sutton%20%28inventor%29">Henry Sutton</a> was born and worked in Ballarat; and Cardinal <a href="George%20Pell">George Pell</a>, the former Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney was born in Ballarat and worked in the area for some time.

Ballarat has also produced many notable athletes including the Olympic long distance runner <a href="Steve%20Moneghetti">Steve Moneghetti</a> and four time Olympic basketball player <a href="Ray%20Borner">Ray Borner</a>. A large number of notable Australian rules football identities have come from Ballarat, including <a href="Australian%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Football Hall of Fame</a> members <a href="Tony%20Lockett">Tony Lockett</a> and <a href="Bob%20Davis%20%28Australian%20rules%20footballer%29">Bob Davis</a>.

In addition, Henry Sutton was an inventor from Ballarat. Sutton designed an electric continuous current dynamo with a practical ring armature. This design could be used as an electric motor and the rapid incline of the electrical industry followed. Sutton was involved in devising and constructing different telephone designs. Sutton interacted closely with Bell (the inventor of the telephone), Bell came to visit Sutton in order to see a complete telephone system that was set up in Sutton's family warehouse.

Ballarat has two major hospitals. The public health services are managed by Ballarat Health Services including the <a href="Ballarat%20Base%20Hospital">Ballarat Base</a> which services the entire region and the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Centre%2C%20Ballarat">Queen Elizabeth Centre</a> for aged care on Ascot Street Sth. The <a href="St%20John%20of%20God%20Health%20Care">St John of God Health Care</a> centre also on Drummond Street Nth, established in 1915 is currently the largest private hospital in regional Victoria.

The Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre (BRICC) on the corner of Drummond and Sturt Street includes a number of facilities focused on cancer treatment.

The Heart Foundation did a study in 2014 that Ballarat had the highest level of physical inactivity (85.3 per cent) in Australia and that 32.9 per cent of residents were deemed obese.

Ballarat's residents are serviced by a wide range of public utilities including water, gas and electricity, telephony and data communications supplied, overseen and regulated by state based authorities and private enterprise and local council.

Water supply as well as sewage collection and disposal are provided by Central Highlands Water. Drinking water is sourced from a network reservoirs all located in the highlands to the east, however the majority is sourced from two main reservoirs—Lal Lal and White Swan. The Lal Lal Reservoir (built in 1970 with a capacity of ) is Ballarat's largest water catchment accounting for approximately two thirds of the city's water usage. The White Swan reservoir (built in 1952 with a capacity) supplies most of the remainder. Since May 2008, the White Swan has been topped up by water from Bendigo's Sandhurst Reservoir through the Goldfields Superpipe with water originally sourced from the <a href="Goulburn%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Goulburn River</a> system. Kirks Reservoir (built between 1860 and 1862 with a capacity of ) and Gong Gong Reservoir (built in 1877 at Gong Gong, Victoria with a capacity of ) are historic main water supplies now maintained for emergency use. Other reservoirs supplying Ballarat include Moorabool reservoir (located in Bolwarrah, Victoria with a capacity of ), Wilson's Reservoir (located in the <a href="Wombat%20State%20Forest">Wombat State Forest</a> with a capacity of ), Beales reservoir (built 1863 located at <a href="Wallace%2C%20Victoria">Wallace</a> with a capacity of ) and Pincotts reservoir (built 1867 located at Leigh Creek, Victoria with a capacity of ). Sewage is managed by two plants—the Ballarat North Wastewater Treatment Plant and the Ballarat South Waste Water Treatment Plant.

Residential electricity is supplied by Victorian electricity distributor <a href="Powercor">Powercor</a>, while residential natural gas is supplied by <a href="AGL%20Energy">AGL Energy</a>.

Telephone services are provided via the Doveton Street (BRAT) telephone exchange which was originally built by the Australian Telecommunications Commission (now known as <a href="Telstra">Telstra</a>) who remains its owner, though <a href="Optus">Optus</a> now also operates services from this facility. The city's cellular network currently uses Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). Telstra has provided mobile telecommunications to Ballarat since 2003 (initially as CDMA). Optus provided competition with its entrance to the market in 2003 along with significant service upgrades in 2004 followed by <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> in mid-2009.

Data communications are provided by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid <a href="optical%20fiber%20cable">optical fiber cable</a> and coaxial cable built by <a href="Neighbourhood%20Cable">Neighbourhood Cable</a> in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchanges—Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), Sebastopol (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the <a href="National%20Broadband%20Network">National Broadband Network</a> (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.

Road transport and the motor vehicle is the main form of transport. A network of state highways radiate from Ballarat and the <a href="Western%20Freeway%20%28Victoria%29">Western Freeway</a> (A8) is <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a> bypasses the central city to the north of the urban area, providing a direct road connection to Melbourne (approximately 90 minutes), westward to <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a> (approximately 75 minutes) and <a href="Horsham%2C%20Victoria">Horsham</a>. Five freeway interchanges service the urban area, East Ballarat (half diamond) interchange at Victoria Street (C805); Brown Hill interchange (full diamond) at Daylesford-Ballarat Road (C292), Creswick Road interchange (full diamond) at Wendouree (A300); the Mount Rowan interchange (half diamond) at Gillies Road, Wendouree (C307) and the Mitchell Park interchange (full diamond) at Howe Street (C287). The <a href="Midland%20Highway%20%28Victoria%29">Midland Highway</a> is a dual carriageway which runs north along Creswick Road to the Western Freeway interchange but becomes a single carriageway north of Ballarat to <a href="Creswick">Creswick</a> (approximately 25 minutes) and runs south as the dual carriageway of Skipton Road to Magpie before becoming a single carriageway to <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a> (approximately 87 minutes). The <a href="Glenelg%20Highway">Glenelg Highway</a> connects directly to <a href="Mount%20Gambier">Mount Gambier</a> and the <a href="Sunraysia%20Highway">Sunraysia Highway</a> west of Ballarat which connects directly to <a href="Mildura">Mildura</a>.

Sturt Street and Victoria Street, both dual carriageways carry the bulk of the east-west CBD traffic, while Mair Street is planned to become a four lane dual carriageway to relieve pressure on these main streets. Other dual carriageway main roads in the west include Howitt Street and Gillies Street. The busiest roads by far are located in the west and south at Albert Street in Redan, Sturt Street in Newington and Gillies Street in Lake Gardens which carry 22,400, 22,000 and 21,500 vehicles per day respectively and all have 4 traffic lanes.

Ballarat is also served by an extensive public bus service operated by CDC Ballarat. They operate 15 routes across the city, routes 10-15, 20-26, 30 & 31, and school bus services..

Numerous private companies service suburban, intercity and interstate routes with <a href="Coach%20%28bus%29">coach</a> services. Gold Bus provides additional suburban services as well as the Ballarat School Bus Network. Ballarat railway station is a major regional terminal for coach services. <a href="V/Line">V/Line</a> operates direct services to regional Victorian locations including <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a>, <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a>, <a href="Warrnambool">Warrnambool</a>, Mildura, <a href="Nhill%2C%20Victoria">Nhill</a>, <a href="Ouyen%2C%20Victoria">Ouyen</a>, <a href="Halls%20Gap%2C%20Victoria">Halls Gap</a>, <a href="Daylesford%2C%20Victoria">Daylesford</a>, Maryborough as well as the South Australian cities of <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="Mount%20Gambier">Mount Gambier</a>. Gold Bus operates direct regional services to links to both <a href="Avoca%2C%20Victoria">Avoca</a> and Maryborough, while Sandlants operates a direct service to <a href="Stawell%2C%20Victoria">Stawell</a>. There is also a direct bus service to Melbourne's <a href="Tullamarine%20Airport">Tullamarine Airport</a> with the Ballarat Airport Shuttlebus. Interstate coaches from <a href="Greyhound%20Australia">Greyhound Australia</a> and <a href="Firefly%20Express">Firefly Express</a> coaches stop at Ballarat on route between Melbourne and Adelaide. The local <a href="taxicab">taxi</a> fleet consists of over 57 vehicles services in all suburbs and is currently operated by Ballarat Taxis Co-op Ltd. Taxis and bus are the only late night public transport option in the city.

Rail

Ballarat has historically been a major <a href="rail%20transport">rail transport</a> hub in Victoria, situated at the junction of the <a href="Serviceton%20railway%20line">Ballarat line</a>, <a href="Serviceton%20railway%20line">Ararat line</a> and <a href="Mildura%20railway%20line">Mildura lines</a> it currently has several connections for both <a href="passenger%20rail">passenger rail</a> services and <a href="Freight%20rail%20transport">freight rail</a>.

The city has two passenger railway stations, the hub of <a href="Ballarat%20railway%20station">Ballarat railway station</a> and suburban <a href="Wendouree%20railway%20station">Wendouree railway station</a>. From Ballarat station, <a href="V/Line">V/Line</a> operates <a href="V/Line%20VLocity">VLocity</a> trains running at up to east to Melbourne, west to <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a> and north to <a href="Maryborough%20railway%20station%2C%20Victoria">Maryborough</a>. Since the controversial removal of "flagship" express services in 2011, successive timetable changes have slowed peak hour services to <a href="Southern%20Cross%20Station">Southern Cross Station</a>, with the current journey taking a minimum of 73 minutes. Patronage however has continued to grow. The <a href="Regional%20Rail%20Link">Regional Rail Link</a> project is aimed at separating Ballarat trains from Melbourne's suburban rail network. Interurban services (Ballarat-Melbourne) now run half-hourly during weekday peak and hourly during weekday non-peak and on weekends from Ballarat station. A twice daily (thrice daily on weekdays) (57 minute) service connects Ballarat to <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a> (stopping at <a href="Beaufort%20railway%20station%2C%20Victoria">Beaufort</a>) while there is a (53 minute) service to and from Maryborough (stopping at <a href="Creswick%20railway%20station">Creswick</a>, <a href="Clunes%20railway%20station%2C%20Victoria">Clunes</a>, and <a href="Talbot%20railway%20station">Talbot</a>) once a day (twice a day on weekdays) each way. Victoria's electronic ticketing system, <a href="Myki">Myki</a>, was implemented on rail services between Wendouree and Melbourne on 24 July 2013.

Ballarat is connected to Geelong by rail via the <a href="Geelong-Ballarat%20railway%20line">Geelong-Ballarat railway line</a>, which currently operates only for freight (passenger services were withdrawn in 1978) although in 2011, a planning study began for returning of passenger services along the line to investigate connecting both cities to Bendigo via Maryborough and Castlemaine. There are also several disused railway corridors and stations along the <a href="Skipton%20railway%20line">Skipton railway</a>, <a href="Buninyong%20railway%20line">Buninyong railway</a>. A former branch line built in 1886 to Redan was sold off by VicTrack and finally dismantled in 2010. The freight line forked off the Singleton line at Lake Gardens running south through Alfredton and then east parallel to Latrobe Street, past the Cattle yards and on to Redan (now Delacombe).

The once extensive <a href="Trams%20in%20Ballarat">Ballarat tramway network</a> operated between 1887 and 1971 with a small section of remaining track being utilised as a tourist and museum tramway. There have been proposals to extend the network, particularly as a major tourist facility but also to connect it to the railways and return it as a viable component of the Ballarat public transport system, including a strong lobby in 2001–2002, 2010–11 and 2014, however Ballarat City Council and federal member of parliament have dismissed recent proposals.

<a href="Ballarat%20Airport">Ballarat Airport</a> located north-west of the CBD consists of two sealed runways (each approximately long and wide) as well as extensive sealed aprons, night lighting and <a href="Non-directional%20beacon">NDB</a> navaid. A Master Plan for the Aerodrome was completed in 2005 followed by an Airport Master Plan in 2013. The report made a series of recommendations and forecasts that included eventual lengthening, widening and strengthening of the existing main runway up to , consideration for expansion of the passenger terminal and recommendations for future use of aprons and development of future structures supporting larger aircraft and increased frequent usage. It was forecast that by 2012–2015 regular domestic passenger services using 40–50 seat commuter aircraft could feasibly commence.

Ballarat has a long history of cycling as a form of transport and recreation. The current cycling network continues to grow and consists of several marked on-road routes and of <a href="segregated%20bicycle%20facilities">segregated bicycle facilities</a> including several main routes:<a href="Ballarat%E2%80%93Skipton%20Rail%20Trail">Ballarat–Skipton Rail Trail</a>, Yarrowee River Trail with connections to the Gong Gong Reservoir. Buningyong Trail, Sebastopol Trail, and the Lake Wendouree shared path. The Ballarat Bicycle Users Group provides advocacy for the growing number of cyclists in the city. The popularity of cycling in Ballarat is also demonstrated by the large number of spectators and participants drawn to cycling sporting events held in the city.

Ballarat is home to three <a href="Outlaw%20motorcycle%20club">bikie chapters</a>, most notably the <a href="Finks%20Motorcycle%20Club">Finks Motorcycle Club</a>, who, in 2010, were planning to build a club house and training centre in the city. Other bikie chapters in the city are the Vikings and the <a href="Bandidos%20Motorcycle%20Club">Bandidos Motorcycle Club</a>. The city was the subject of an ABC "<a href="Four%20Corners%20%28Australian%20TV%20program%29">Four Corners</a>" report on the use of methamphetamine in Australia, along with <a href="Devonport%2C%20Tasmania">Devonport</a>, <a href="Burnie%2C%20Tasmania">Burnie</a>, <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Castlemaine</a> and <a href="St%20Arnaud%2C%20Victoria">St Arnaud</a>. Ballarat also has 3 police stations: Ballarat, Ballarat North and Ballarat West.

Battle of Abritus

The Battle of Abritus, also known as the Battle of Forum Terebronii, occurred in the Roman province of <a href="Moesia%20Inferior">Moesia Inferior</a> (modern <a href="Razgrad">Razgrad</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>) probably in July, 251, between the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and a federation of <a href="Scythians%23Migration%20period">Scythian</a> tribesmen under the <a href="Goths">Goth</a> king <a href="Cniva">Cniva</a>. The Romans were soundly defeated, and <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>s <a href="Decius">Decius</a> and his son <a href="Herennius%20Etruscus">Herennius Etruscus</a> were both killed during battle. They became the first Roman emperors killed in a battle by a foreign enemy.

The battle typically marks the starting of a period of increased military and political instability in the Roman Empire, although the symptoms of the crisis had already appeared in the preceding decades.

Soon after Decius ascended to the throne in 249, barbarian tribes invaded the Roman provinces of <a href="Roman%20Dacia">Dacia</a>, <a href="Moesia%20Superior">Moesia Superior</a> and <a href="Moesia%20Inferior">Moesia Inferior</a>. Two factors had contributed to growing unrest in the area north of Danube. First, Decius' predecessor <a href="Philip%20the%20Arab">Philip the Arab</a> had refused to continue payments, initiated by Emperor <a href="Maximinus%20Thrax">Maximinus Thrax</a> in 238, of annual subsidies to the aggressive tribes of the region. Second and more important, there were continuous movements of new peoples since the time of Emperor <a href="Severus%20Alexander">Severus Alexander</a>. Decius may also have taken with him troops from the Danube frontier, in order to depose Philip in 249. The resultant military vacuum would inevitably attract invaders.

The course of events is not clear. It seems that in 250 the <a href="Carpians">Carpi</a> invaded Dacia, eastern <a href="Moesia%20Superior">Moesia Superior</a> and western Moesia Inferior. At the same time, a tribal coalition under Cniva crossed the Roman frontier, probably advancing in two columns. Whether these were consisted only of Goths is rather unlikely so the name "Scythians" by which the Greek sources called them (a geographical definition) seems more appropriate. It is quite possible that other people of Germanic and Sarmatian origin (like <a href="Bastarnae">Bastarnae</a>, <a href="Taifals">Taifals</a> and <a href="Hasdingi">Hasdingian Vandals</a>), perhaps Roman deserters as well, had joined the invaders. However, the name of the king is indeed Gothic and probably genuine.

The first column of Cniva's army, a detachment of about 20,000 or so likely led by the chieftains Argaith and Gunteric, besieged <a href="Marcianopolis">Marcianopolis</a>, without success it seems. Then they probably headed south to besiege Philippopolis (now <a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a> in Bulgaria). Cniva's main column under the King himself crossed Danube at <a href="Oescus">Oescus</a> then headed eastwards to <a href="Novae">Novae</a>, where he was repelled by the provincial governor (and future emperor) <a href="Trebonianus%20Gallus">Trebonianus Gallus</a>. Then the invaders headed south to plunder <a href="Nicopolis%20ad%20Istrum">Nicopolis ad Istrum</a> where Decius defeated them but not decisively. After these initial setbacks, the barbarians moved southwards through <a href="Balkan%20Mountains">Haemus mountain</a> and Decius pursued them (likely through the <a href="Shipka%20Pass%23Shipka%20Pass">Shipka Pass</a>) to save Philippopolis. This time Decius' army was taken by surprise while resting at <a href="Stara%20Zagora">Beroe</a>/Augusta Traiana. The Romans were heavily defeated in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Beroe">battle</a>. Decius was forced to withdraw his army to the north at Oescus, leaving Cniva ample time to ravage Moesia and finally capture Philippopolis in the summer of 251, in part with the help of its commander, a certain <a href="Titus%20Julius%20Priscus">Titus Julius Priscus</a> who had proclaimed himself Emperor. It seems that Priscus, after receiving the news of the defeat at Beroe, thought that the Goths would spare him and the city. He was wrong and was probably killed when the city fell. Then the Scythians began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.

In the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general <a href="Trebonianus%20Gallus">Trebonianus Gallus</a>, intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty.

Probably in July or August of 251, the Roman army engaged the Scythians under Cniva near Abritus. The strengths of the bellingerent forces are unknown, but we know that Cniva divided his forces into three units, with one of these parts concealed behind a swamp. It seems that Cniva was a skilled tactician and that he was very familiar with the surrounding terrain. Jordanes and Aurelius Victor claim that Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow during a skirmish before the outset of the battle and that his father addressed his soldiers as if the loss of his son did not matter. He allegedly said, "Let no one mourn. The death of one soldier is not a great loss to the Republic". However, other sources state that Herennius died with his father.
The manoeuvre of the Scythians was ultimately successful. Decius' forces defeated their opponents in the front line, but made the fatal mistake of pursuing their fleeing enemy into the swamp, where they were ambushed and routed. The immense slaughter marked one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of the Roman Empire and resulted in the death of Decius himself. <a href="Joannes%20Zonaras">Zonaras</a> vividly narrates how: "He and his son and a large number of Romans fell into the marshland; all of them perished there, none of their bodies to be found, as they were covered by the mud."

A 6th-century Byzantine scholar, <a href="Zosimus">Zosimus</a> also described the total massacre of Decius' troops and the fall of the pagan emperor:
"Proceeding therefore incautiously in an unknown place, he and his army became entangled in the mire, and under that disadvantage were so assailed by the missiles of the Barbarians, that not one of them escaped with life. Thus ended the life of the excellent emperor Decius."

<a href="Lactantius">Lactantius</a>, a 4th-century <a href="early%20Christian">early Christian</a> and advisor to Roman Emperor <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, described the emperor's demise as following :
"he was suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain, together with great part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the rites of sepulture, but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by wild beasts and birds, a fit end for the enemy of <a href="God">God</a>."

The supposedly treacherous behavior of Treboniannus Gallus who, according to Zosimus, signalled the final Gothic assault is not accepted today. It seems impossible that the shattered Roman legions proclaimed emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Another strong point against Gallus' treason is the fact that he adopted <a href="Hostilian">Hostilian</a>, the younger son of Decius, after returning to Rome.

The long-debated location of Abritus was finally established (1 km east of the city of Razgrad) after the excavations published by T. Ivanov in 1969 and 1971. According to recent findings, the location of the battle is about 15 kilometres northwest of Abritus, in the valley of the river <a href="Beli%20Lom">Beli Lom</a>, to the south of the village of Dryanovets.

Gallus, who became emperor upon Decius' death, negotiated a treaty with the Goths under duress, which allowed them to keep their booty and return to their homes on the other side of the Danube. It is also possible that he agreed to pay an annual tribute in return for the Goths' promise to respect Roman territory. This humiliating treaty, the contemporary spread of <a href="Plague%20of%20Cyprian">Plague of Cyprian</a> with its devastating effects and the chaotic situation in the East with the Sassanian invasions left Gallus with a very bad reputation amongst the latter Roman historians. However, D. S. Potter suggests that, before the defeat at Abritus, the situation was not so serious that the available Roman forces would not be able to manage the invasions. Therefore, it is Decius' bad conduct which was responsible for the disastrous turn of the events. In any case, Gallus had no choice but to get rid of the Goths as soon as possible.

<a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> rated this reverse with the most serious military disasters of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> to his time: <a href="Publius%20Quinctilius%20Varus">Varus'</a> defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a>, the incursions of the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> during the reign of <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople%20%28378%29">Battle of Adrianople</a>.

In 271, the Emperor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> conclusively defeated the Goths and killed their king Cannobaudes in battle. Based on the similarity of the names, that king might coincide with the king Cniva who defeated Decius in Abritus.

Battle of Berestechko

The Battle of Berestechko (; ) was fought between the <a href="Zaporozhian%20Cossacks">Ukrainian Cossacks</a>, led by <a href="Hetman">Hetman</a> <a href="Bohdan%20Khmelnytsky">Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a>, aided by their <a href="Crimean%20Tatars">Crimean Tatar</a> allies, and a <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Polish</a> army under King <a href="John%20II%20of%20Poland">John II Casimir</a>. It was a battle of a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place in the years 1648–1657 after the expiration of a two-year truce. Fought from 28 to 30 June 1651, the battle took place in the province of <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>, on the hilly plain south of the <a href="Styr%20River">Styr River</a>. The Polish camp was on the river opposite Berestechko and faced south, towards the Cossack army about two kilometers away, whose right flank was against the <a href="River%20Pliashivka">River Pliashivka</a> (Pliashova) and the Tatar army on their left flank. It was probably the largest European land battle of the 17th century.

The number of Polish troops is uncertain. One of the senior Polish commanders, Duke <a href="Bogus%C5%82aw%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Bogusław Radziwiłł</a>, wrote that the Polish army had 80,000 soldiers, which included "40,000 regulars and 40,000 nobles of the "levée en masse", accompanied by roughly the same number of various servants, footmen, and such." Some modern historians, such as Zbigniew Wójcik, Józef Gierowski, and <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Czapli%C5%84ski">Władysław Czapliński</a>, have reduced this figure to 60,000-63,000 soldiers.

There is no reliable source on the number of Cossack and Crimean Tatar troops. The possible estimates range from 80,000 men to 200,000 men. The core of Cossack army at Berestechko consisted of 12 regiments named after towns they were stationed in (list numbers provided according to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Zboriv">Treaty of Zboriv</a> (1649)):

A total of 33,313 registered Cossacks from the above. Additional 5 Cossack regiments (of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, <a href="Kaniv">Kaniv</a>, <a href="Chernigiv">Chernigiv</a>, <a href="Nizhyn">Nizhyn</a>, <a href="Pavoloch">Pavoloch</a>) didn't participate in the battle being deployed mostly against the Lithuanian forces of <a href="Janusz%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%20%281612%E2%80%931655%29">Janusz Radziwiłł</a> advancing on Kiev. The registered Cossack force was supported by a large number of Ukrainian peasants armed with scythes, flails and the likes which were rather undisciplined and organised poorly. The Crimean Tatar horde is estimated to 28,000–33,000 men, though might be lower. There were also 2 thousand Don Cossacks and a few thousand of <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a> and <a href="Vlachs">Vlachs</a>.

On 19 June 1651, the Polish army numbered 14,844 Polish cavalry, 2,250 German-style cavalry, 11,900 German-style infantry and dragoons, 2,950 Hungarian-style infantry ("<a href="haiduks">haiduks</a>"), 1,550 Lithuanian volunteers, and 960 <a href="Lipka%20Tatars">Lipka Tatars</a>. There were also 16,000 German mercenaries who suffered from disease and hunger due to a delayed pay and inflated food prices in the camp. A number of <a href="registered%20Cossacks">registered Cossacks</a> remained loyal and participated in the battle on the Polish side. Many <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s brought in their large private armies. In addition, there was a huge militia force, of limited value, numbering 30,000 noblemen of the "<a href="pospolite%20ruszenie">levée en masse</a>".

The Polish commanders were hoping to break the Cossack ranks with a charge of the Polish <a href="Winged%20Hussars">Winged Hussars</a>, a tactic that had proven effective in many previous battles, including at <a href="Battle%20of%20Kircholm">Kircholm</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Kluszyn">Kłuszyn</a> (and which would later prove successful at the 1683 <a href="Battle%20of%20Vienna">Battle of Vienna</a> against the Turks).

The Cossack army was well acquainted with this Polish style of war, having had much experience fighting against the Poles and alongside them. Their preferred tactic was to avoid an open field battle, and to fight from the cover of a huge fortified camp.

2000 Polish cavalry (one regiment under the command of <a href="Aleksander%20Koniecpolski%20%281620-1659%29">Aleksander Koniecpolski</a>, supported by <a href="Jerzy%20Sebastian%20Lubomirski">Jerzy Lubomirski</a>, six <a href="Towarzysz%20pancerny">pancerni</a> cavalry companies of <a href="Jeremi%20Wi%C5%9Bniowiecki">Jeremi Wiśniowiecki</a> and <a href="Winged%20Hussars">Winged Hussars</a> under the command of <a href="Stefan%20Czarniecki">Stefan Czarniecki</a>) repulsed the Tatars, who suffered heavy losses.
During the first day of "skirmishes by the Tatar and Cossack vanguard regiments", the Poles were victorious "since their army sustained that first attack cheerfully and in high spirits".

The Poles, encouraged by their success on the first day, deployed all their available cavalry against the "main Tatar horde" and "Cossack vanguard regiments". The Polish infantry and artillery remained in camp and did not support the cavalry. This time, Tatar cavalry gained the upper hand, pushing the Poles back to their camp but were then "barely repelled" by heavy fire from the Polish infantry and artillery. The Poles lost 300 of szlachta, including many officers of "caliber", and the "escort troop of <a href="Hetman">Hetman</a> Mikołaj Potocki". During the second day of the battle, the rebels were victorious, although "the Tatars, too, were unpleasantly surprised by the determination and endurance of the Polish army in both battles and, having suffered rather painful losses of their own, they lost heart". Toğay bey and Khan's brother-in-law Mehmet Giray were killed.

The "king insisted, at a night council, on engaging the enemy in a decisive battle the next day, Friday, 30 June". The Polish army appeared out of the "morning mist in full strength" but only the Tatars engaged in skirmishes which was met by the Polish artillery. The Cossack defences consisted of two fortified camps, a larger for the registered Cossacks and a smaller for the peasant militia, both protected by 10 lines of chained wagons. At 3 p.m. Duke <a href="Jeremi%20Wi%C5%9Bniowiecki">Jeremi Wiśniowiecki</a> led a successful charge of 18 cavalry companies against the right wing of the Cossack-Tatar army and "the zealous cavalry attack was a success: it broke up the rows of Cossack infantry and the wagons moving in corral formation". However the Cossacks regrouped, pushed the Polish cavalry out of the camp and advanced further with a help of the Tatars. The left flank of the Polish army started to retreat when the King reinforced it with all German mercenaries under command of Colonel Houwaldt who repulsed the attack and "drove the Tatars from the field". During the fighting, a Polish nobleman called Otwinowski noticed the Tatar Khan's standard, and Polish artillery was directed to fire at it. Khan's brother Amurat was wounded mortally. With the battle already turning against them, the Tatar forces panicked, "abandoning the Khan's camp as it stood", and fled the battlefield leaving most of their belongings behind. Khmelnytsky and Vyhovsky with a few Cossacks chased Khan attempting to bring him with his force back, but were taken hostage to be released when the battle was over. A heavy rain started which complicated cavalry operations. With the Tatar cavalry gone, the Cossacks moved their wagons in the night to a better defensive position closer to the river, dug trenches and constructed walls to the Polish surprise in the morning.

The Polish army and Cossack camp exchanged artillery fire for ten days while both sides built fortifications. The Poles tried to blockade the camp. Leaderless without Khmelnytsky, the Cossacks were commanded by Colonel Filon Dzhalalii, who was replaced by <a href="Ivan%20Bogun">Ivan Bohun</a> on July 9. Other accounts state the commander was Matvii Hladky. The Cossack morale was decreasing and desertions started to the other river side, though they maintained a high rate of artillery fire and made occasional sorties. When the offered terms for surrender were rejected, the Poles prepared to dam the Pliashivka River so as to flood the Cossack camp. <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Lanckoro%C5%84ski%20%28hetman%29">Stanisław Lanckoroński</a> with a 2 thousand cavalry force moved across the river on July 9 to complete encirclement of the Cossacks. When they found out of the Polish advance, Bohun called for a council with other leaders of the registered Cossacks on further actions. However none of the peasant militia was invited to the council. The Cossacks built 3 bridges and Bohun led 2 thousand cavalry with 2 cannons to the other river side by the morning of July 10 to attack Lanckoroński. The uninformed peasants thought they were abandoned, started to panic and flee across the river. Lanckoroński didn't expect a large movement in his direction and retreated. Bohun returned to the camp and tried to restore order, but in vain. The main Polish force observed the disorder, but didn't launch an attack on the Cossack camp immediately thinking of a trap. They assaulted eventually, breached the defences and made their way to the river crossing. A few Cossack regiments managed to retreat in order though. Some Cossacks drowned, but archaeological excavations on the river crossing site revealed about a hundred Cossack human remains all having damage due to cold weapons to their bones which suggested heavy fighting. A rearguard of 200 to 300 Cossacks protected the river crossing; all of them were killed in battle rejecting surrender offers. "Khmelnytsky's tent was captured intact, with all his belongings", which included two banners, one he received from John II Casimir's 1649 commission and one from <a href="Wladyslaw%20IV">Wladyslaw IV</a> in 1646. Although it was difficult to estimate how many Cossacks and peasants were killed in the retreat, Piasecki and Brzostowski, who participated in the battle, mentioned 3,000 killed. Tsar's ambassador <a href="podyachy">podyachy</a> Bogdanov in his report to Moscow mentioned 4,000 killed. Most Cossack artillery pieces were either lost to the Poles or drowned in the marshes. Many spoils were collected in the Cossack camp including the army treasury of 30 thousand talers.

As the battle ended, King John Casimir made the error of not pressing even harder the pursuit of the fleeing Cossacks, "the first several days following ... defeat of the enemy were so blatantly wasted" but there "was the unwillingness of the nobility's levée en masse to proceed into Ukraine" plus "rainy weather and a lack of food and fodder, coupled with epidemics and diseases that were becoming active in the army, were generally undercutting any energy for war". The "king left the whole army to Potocki" on 17 July [N.S.] and returned "to Warsaw to celebrate his victories over the Cossacks". After making promises of a pecuniary nature, Khmelnytsky was soon released by the Tatar Khan. He was then able to reassemble the Cossack host, which was able to present a substantial army to confront the Poles at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bila%20Tserkva%20%281651%29">Battle of Bila Tserkva (1651)</a>. Poland and "the bulk of the rebels make peace in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Bila%20Tserkva">Treaty of Bila Tserkva</a>" on 28 September 1651, which "reduces the number of registered Cossacks from 40,000 to 20,000 and deprives them of the right to settle in or control various provinces of Ukraine previously allowed to them under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Zboriv">Treaty of Zboriv</a>". The Ukrainian revolt, far from ending, would continue for several more years under Khmelnytsky.
<a href="Samuel%20Twardowski">Samuel Twardowski</a>'s narrative poem, "The Civil War", describes the setting for the battle along the Styr River:

<poem>
There is a little town on it,
In the middle of Volhynia, called Berestechko,
Belonging to the Leszczynski family, that was not as famous in the past
As it has now become – both ancient <a href="Battle%20of%20Cannae">Cannae</a>
And <a href="Khotyn">Khotyn</a> are far outshone by it, because as many heads here
Our eyes have seen as at <a href="Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a>
Or <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Marathon</a> they counted, although there the whole strength
Of Europe and Asia had come together.
Since our arrival – hilly roads
And steep slopes, until open
Meadows unfold near the Styr's
Low banks. It was pleasant to look from the south
At the pyramid of the Pronskis and the groves that are green
In winter always. And to th east there lies as if a natural
Field for a camp – and there it was indeed placed
Later, but first – this was pondered for a long time.
</poem>

The Battle of Berestechko is commemorated on the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier%2C%20Warsaw">Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw</a>, with the inscription "BERESTECZKO 28-30 VI 1651".

Bohdan Khmelnytsky

Zynoviy Bohdan Khmelnytsky (<a href="Ruthenian%20language">Ruthenian language</a>: Ѕѣнові Богдан Хмелнiцкiи; modern ; ; 6 August 1657) was a <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> <a href="Hetman%20of%20Zaporizhian%20Host">Hetman</a> of the <a href="Zaporozhian%20Host">Zaporozhian Host</a> of the <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Crown of the Kingdom of Poland</a> in the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> (now part of <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>). He <a href="Khmelnytsky%20Uprising">led an uprising</a> against the Commonwealth and its <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s (1648–1654) that resulted in the creation of a state led by the <a href="Ukrainian%20Cossacks">Cossacks of Ukraine</a>. In 1654, he concluded the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Pereyaslav">Treaty of Pereyaslav</a> with the <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Tsardom of Russia</a>.

Although there is no definite proof of the date of Khmelnytsky's birth, Ukrainian historian <a href="Mykhaylo%20Maksymovych">Mykhaylo Maksymovych</a> suggests that it is likely 27 December 1595 (<a href="St.%20Theodore%20%28died%20820%29">St. Theodore</a>'s day). As was the custom in the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a>, he was baptized with one of his middle names, Theodor, translated into Ukrainian as Bohdan. A biography of Khmelnytsky by Smoliy and Stepankov, however, suggests that it is more likely he was born on 9 November (feast day of St Zenoby, 30 October in <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>) and was baptised on 11 November (feast day of <a href="St.%20Theodore%20%28died%20820%29">St. Theodore</a> in the Catholic Church).

Khmelnytsky was probably born in the village of <a href="Subotiv">Subotiv</a>, near <a href="Chyhyryn">Chyhyryn</a> in the <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Crown of the Kingdom of Poland</a> at the estate of his father <a href="Mykhailo%20Khmelnytsky">Mykhailo Khmelnytsky</a>. His father, a <a href="courtier">courtier</a> of <a href="Great%20Crown%20Hetman">Great Crown Hetman</a> <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20%C5%BB%C3%B3%C5%82kiewski">Stanisław Żółkiewski</a>, was of noble birth and belonged to the <a href="Clan">Clan</a> <a href="Massalski%20coat%20of%20arms">Massalski</a>, <a href="Abdank%20coat%20of%20arms">Abdank</a> or <a href="Syrokomla%20coat%20of%20arms">Syrokomla</a>, but there has been controversy as to whether Bohdan belonged to the szlachta (Polish term for noblemen). Some sources state that in 1590 his father Mykhailo was appointed as a <a href="sotnyk">sotnyk</a> for the Korsun-Chyhyryn starosta <a href="Jan%20Miko%C5%82aj%20Dani%C5%82owicz">Jan Daniłowicz</a>, who continued to colonize the new Ukrainian lands near the <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> river. According to the above-mentioned-source, Mykhailo established <a href="Chyhyryn">Chyhyryn</a> and later his own family estates of Subotiv (5 miles from Chyhyryn) and <a href="Novoseltsi">Novoseltsi</a>. Khmelnytsky identified as a noble, and his father's status as a deputy <a href="Starosta">Starosta</a> (<a href="Elder%20%28administrative%20title%29">elder</a>) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others. During the Uprising, however, Khmelnytsky would stress his mother's Cossack roots and his father's exploits with the <a href="Zaporizhian%20Sich">Cossacks of the Sich</a>.

Khmelnytsky's early education cannot be documented. Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>'s Orthodox fraternity schools. He continued his education in Polish at a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> college, possibly in <a href="Jaros%C5%82aw">Jarosław</a>, but more likely in <a href="Lviv">Lviv</a> in the school founded by hetman Żółkiewski. He completed his schooling by 1617, acquiring a broad knowledge of world history and learning Polish and Latin. Later he learned Turkish, <a href="Crimean%20Tatar%20language">Tatar</a>, and French. Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace Roman Catholicism but remained <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a>.

Bohdan Khmelnytsky married Hanna Somkivna, a daughter of a rich <a href="Principality%20of%20Pereslavl">Pereyaslavl</a> Cossack; the couple settled in <a href="Subotiv">Subotiv</a>. By the second half of the 1620s, they had three daughters: Stepanida, Olena, and Kateryna. His first son <a href="Tymofiy%20Khmelnytsky">Tymish (Tymofiy)</a> was born in 1632, and another son <a href="Yuriy%20Khmelnytsky">Yuriy</a> was born in 1640.

Upon completion of his studies in 1617, Khmelnytsky entered into service with the Cossacks. As early as 1619 he was sent together with his father to <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth entered into war against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. His first military engagement was a tragic one. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cecora%20%281620%29">battle of Cecora</a> (Țuțora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky, among many others including future hetman <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Koniecpolski">Stanisław Koniecpolski</a>, was captured by the Turks. He spent the next two years in captivity in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> as a prisoner of an <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman</a> <a href="Kapudan%20Pasha">Kapudan Pasha</a> (presumably <a href="Parlak%20Mustafa%20Pasha">Parlak Mustafa Pasha</a>). Other sources claim that he spent his slavery in <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> on <a href="galley">galley</a>s as an <a href="oarsman">oarsman</a>, where he picked up a knowledge of <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic languages</a>.

While there is no concrete evidence as to his return to Ukraine, most historians believe Khmelnytsky either escaped or was ransomed. Sources vary as to his benefactor — his mother, friends, the Polish king — but perhaps by <a href="Krzysztof%20Zbaraski">Krzysztof Zbaraski</a>, ambassador of the Commonwealth to the <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a>. In 1622 he paid 30,000 <a href="thaler">thaler</a>s in ransom for all <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> captured at the Battle of Cecora. Upon return to Subotiv, Khmelnytsky took over operating his father's estate and became a <a href="Registered%20Cossacks">registered Cossack</a> in the <a href="Chyhyryn%20Regiment">Chyhyryn Regiment</a>. He was later promoted to <a href="pysar">pysar</a> (a historical officer title among Cossacks). From 1625, he participated in several sea raids on <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> together with <a href="Zaporozhian%20Cossacks">Zaporozhian Cossacks</a>. In those raids he earned his title of <a href="sotnyk">sotnyk</a> (a leader of a hundred).

During this period his widowed mother remarried, to <a href="Belarusians">Belarusian</a> noble Vasyl Stavetsky, and moved to his estate, leaving Khmelnytsky in charge of Subotiv. Within year she gave birth to another son, Hryhoriy; later he took his mother's name, becoming known as Hryhoriy Khmelnytsky. For a short time, the senior Khmelnytsky served as a <a href="koniuszy">koniuszy</a> to hetman <a href="Miko%C5%82aj%20Potocki">Mikołaj Potocki</a> but departed relatively quickly after a personal conflict.

Khmelnytsky ran his estate and advanced in rank in his regiment. He first became a <a href="sotnyk">sotnyk</a> and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe. He had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks. On 30 August 1637, he was included in a delegation to <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20IV">Władysław IV</a>. Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and respected commander, hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, he participated in a successful campaign when the Commonwealth army (and his regiment) scored a decisive victory over the <a href="Crimean%20Khanate">Crimean Khanate</a> in 1644. According to archival documents, he also had a meeting in Warsaw with the French ambassador Count De Bregie, during which he discussed the possibility of Cossack participation in war in France. Sources vary as to whether in April 1645 he travelled to France (to <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>) to discuss further details of Cossack service in France; this claim is supported by Ukrainian historiography but disputed by Polish scholarship. In October 1644 around 2,000 (two thousand) Polish infantry soldiers (some scholars think they were Cossacks, but the French sources do not identify them as such) went to France by sea via <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a> and <a href="Calais">Calais</a>, where they participated in the siege and capture of <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>.

Upon the death of magnate <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Koniecpolski">Stanisław Koniecpolski</a>, an advocate of fair treatment of <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>, his successor, <a href="Aleksander%20Koniecpolski%20%281620%E2%80%931659%29">Aleksander</a>, redrew the maps of his possessions. He laid claim to Khmelnytsky's estate, claiming it as his. Trying to find protection from this grab by the powerful magnate, Khmelnytsky wrote numerous appeals and letters to different representatives of the Polish crown but to no avail. At the end of 1645 the Chyhyryn <a href="starosta">starosta</a> <a href="Daniel%20Czapli%C5%84ski">Daniel Czapliński</a> officially received authority from Koniecpolski to seize Khmelnytsky's Subotiv estate.

In the summer of 1646, Khmelnytsky arranged an audience with King Władysław IV to plead his case, as he had favourable standing at the court. Władysław, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter, protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate. But, because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine, even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates. In the beginning of 1647, Daniel Czapliński started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land. On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten. Finally, in April 1647, Czapliński succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, and he was forced to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn.

In May 1647, Khmelnytsky arranged a second audience with the king to plead his case but found him unwilling to confront a powerful magnate. In addition to losing the estate, Khmelnytsky suffered the loss of his wife Hanna, and he was left alone with their children. He promptly remarried, to Motrona (), the so-called "<a href="Helen%20of%20Troy">Helen</a> of the steppe". He was less successful in real estate, and was unable to regain the land and property of his estate or financial compensation for it. During this time, he met several higher Polish officials to discuss the Cossacks' war with the Tatars, and used this occasion again to plead his case with Czapliński, still unsuccessfully.

While Khmelnytsky found no support from the Polish officials, he found it in his Cossack friends and subordinates. His Chyhyryn regiment and others were on his side. All through the autumn of 1647 Khmelnytsky travelled from one regiment to another, and had numerous consultations with Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine. His activity raised suspicion among the local Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested. Koniecpolski issued an order for his execution, but the Chyhyryn Cossack <a href="polkovnyk">polkovnyk</a>, who held Khmelnytsky, was persuaded to release him. Not willing to tempt fate any further, Khmelnytsky headed for the <a href="Zaporozhian%20Sich">Zaporozhian Sich</a> with a group of his supporters.

While the Czapliński Affair is generally regarded as the immediate cause of the uprising, it was primarily a catalyst for actions representing rising popular discontent. Religion, ethnicity, and economics factored into this discontent. While the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> remained <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">a union</a> of nations, a sizable population of Orthodox <a href="Ruthenians">Ruthenians</a> were ignored. Oppressed by the Polish magnates, they took their wrath out on Poles, as well as Jewish traders, who often managed the estates of Polish nobles. The advent of the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> worsened relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Many Orthodox Ukrainians considered the <a href="Union%20of%20Brest">Union of Brest</a> as a threat to their Orthodox faith.

At the end of 1647 Khmelnytsky reached the <a href="estuary">estuary</a> of the <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> river. On 7 December, his small detachment (300–500 men), with the help of registered Cossacks who went over to his side, disarmed the small Polish detachment guarding the area and took over the Zaporozhian Sich. The Poles attempted to retake the Sich but were decisively defeated as more registered Cossacks joined the forces. At the end of January 1648, a <a href="Cossack%20Rada">Cossack Rada</a> was called and Khmelnytsky was unanimously elected a <a href="hetman">hetman</a>. A period of feverish activity followed. Cossacks were sent with hetman's letters to many regions of Ukraine calling on Cossacks and Orthodox peasants to join the rebellion, <a href="Khortytsia">Khortytsia</a> was fortified, efforts were made to acquire and make weapons and ammunition, and emissaries were sent to the <a href="Khan%20of%20Crimea">Khan of Crimea</a>, <a href="%C4%B0sl%C3%A2m%20III%20Giray">İslâm III Giray</a>.

Initially, Polish authorities took the news of Khmelnytsky's arrival at the Sich and reports about the rebellion lightly. The two sides exchanged lists of demands: the Poles asked the Cossacks to surrender the mutinous leader and disband, while Khmelnytsky and the Rada demanded that the Commonwealth restore the Cossacks' ancient rights, stop the advance of the <a href="Ukrainian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church</a>, yield the right to appoint Orthodox leaders of the Sich and of the Registered Cossack regiments, and to remove Commonwealth troops from Ukraine. The Polish magnates considered the demands an affront, and an army headed by Stefan Potocki moved in the direction of the Sich.

Had the Cossacks stayed at Khortytsia, they might have been defeated, as in many other rebellions. However, Khmelnytsky marched against the Poles. The two armies met on 16 May 1648 at <a href="Battle%20of%20Zhovti%20Vody">Zhovti Vody</a>, where, aided by the Tatars of <a href="Tugay%20Bey">Tugay Bey</a>, the Cossacks inflicted their first crushing defeat on the Commonwealth. It was repeated soon afterwards, with the same success, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Korsu%C5%84">Battle of Korsuń</a> on 26 May 1648. Khmelnytsky used his diplomatic and military skills: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their manoeuvrers and attacks, and most importantly, he gained the support of both large contingents of registered Cossacks and the <a href="Giray%20dynasty">Crimean Khan</a>, his crucial ally for the many battles to come.

At Christmas in 1648, Khmelnytsky made a triumphant entry into Kiev, where he was hailed as "the <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, saviour, redeemer, and liberator of the people from Polish captivity... the illustrious ruler of Rus." The <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a> Paiseus, who was visiting Kiev at this time, referred to Khmelnytsky as the Prince of Rus, the head of an independent Ukrainian state, according to contemporaries. In February 1649, during negotiations in <a href="Pereiaslav">Pereiaslav</a> with a Polish delegation headed by Senator <a href="Adam%20Kysil">Adam Kysil</a>, Khmelnytsky declared that he was "the sole autocrat of Rus" and that he had "enough power in Ukraine, <a href="Podilia">Podilia</a>, and <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>... in his land and principality stretching as far as Lviv, <a href="Che%C5%82m">Chełm</a>, and <a href="Halych">Halych</a>."

The Polish envoys recognized that Khmelnytsky claimed to be leader of the Zaporozhian Cossacks but also of Ukraine and the heritage of the Rus. A <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> in Khmelnytsky's honour (1650–1651) said: "While in Poland it is King <a href="Jan%20II%20Casimir%20Vasa">Jan II Casimir Vasa</a>, in Rus it is Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky."

After the period of initial military successes, the <a href="state-building">state-building</a> process began. His leadership was demonstrated in all areas of state-building: military, administration, finance, economics and culture. Khmelnytsky made the <a href="Zaporozhian%20Host">Zaporozhian Host</a> the supreme power in the new Ukrainian state and unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. Khmelnytsky built a new government system and developed military and civilian administration.

A new generation of statesmen and military leaders came to the forefront: <a href="Ivan%20Vyhovsky">Ivan Vyhovsky</a>, <a href="Pavlo%20Teteria">Pavlo Teteria</a>, <a href="Danylo%20Nechai">Danylo Nechai</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Nechai">Ivan Nechai</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Bohun">Ivan Bohun</a>, <a href="Hryhoriy%20Hulyanytsky">Hryhoriy Hulyanytsky</a>. From Cossack polkovnyks, officers, and military commanders, a new elite within the Cossack Hetman state was born. Throughout the years, the elite preserved and maintained the autonomy of the <a href="Cossack%20Hetmanate">Cossack Hetmanate</a> in the face of Russia's attempt to curb it. It was also instrumental in the onset of the period of <a href="Ruin%20%28period%20of%20history%29">Ruin</a> that followed, eventually destroying most of the achievements of the Khmelnytsky era.

Khmelnytsky's initial successes were followed by a series of setbacks as neither Khmelnytsky nor the Commonwealth had enough strength to stabilise the situation or to inflict a defeat on the enemy. What followed was a period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which were seldom upheld. From spring 1649 onward, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks; as Polish attacks increased in frequency, they became more successful. The resulting <a href="Treaty%20of%20Zboriv">Treaty of Zboriv</a> on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks. It was followed by another defeat at the <a href="battle%20of%20Berestechko">battle of Berestechko</a> on 18 June 1651 in which the Tatars betrayed Khmelnytsky and held the hetman captive. The Cossacks suffered a crushing defeat, with an estimated 30,000 casualties. They were forced to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Bila%20Tserkva">Treaty of Bila Tserkva</a>, which favoured the Poland–Lithuanian. Warfare broke open again and, in the years that followed, the two sides were almost perpetually at war. Now, the <a href="Crimean%20Tatars">Crimean Tatars</a> played a decisive role and did not allow either side to prevail. It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region.

Khmelnytsky started looking for another foreign ally. Although the Cossacks had established their "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy, which could be provided by a foreign monarch. In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the <a href="Ottoman%20sultan">Ottoman sultan</a> in 1651, and formal embassies were exchanged. The Turks offered vassalship, like their other arrangements with contemporary <a href="Khanate%20of%20Crimea">Crimea</a>, <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> and <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>. However, the idea of a union with the Muslim monarch was not acceptable to the general populace and most Cossacks.

The other possible ally was the Orthodox <a href="tsar%20of%20Russia">tsar of Russia</a>. That government remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine. In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the tsar preferred to wait, until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action. The idea that the tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman and so diplomatic activity intensified.

After a series of negotiations, it was agreed that the Cossacks would accept overlordship by the Tsar <a href="Alexei%20Mikhailovich">Alexei Mikhailovich</a>. To finalize the treaty, a Russian embassy led by <a href="boyar">boyar</a> <a href="Vasily%20Buturlin">Vasily Buturlin</a> came to <a href="Pereyaslav">Pereyaslav</a>, where, on 18 January 1654, the Cossack Rada was called and the treaty concluded. Historians have not come to consensus in interpreting the intentions of the tsar and Khmelnytsky in signing this agreement. The treaty legitimized Russian claims to the capital of <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> and strengthened the tsar's influence in the region. Khmelnytsky needed the treaty to gain a legitimate monarch's protection and support from a friendly Orthodox power.

Historians have differed in their reading of Khmelnytsky's goal with the union: whether it was to be a military union, a <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>, or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the <a href="Tsardom%20of%20Russia">Tsardom of Russia</a>.

The differences were expressed during the ceremony of the oath of allegiance to the tsar: the Russian envoy refused to reciprocate with an oath from the ruler to his subjects, as the Cossacks and Ruthenians expected since it was the custom of the Polish king.

Khmelnytsky stormed out of the church and threatened to cancel the entire treaty. The Cossacks decided to rescind the demand and abide by the treaty.

As a result of the 1654 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Pereyaslav">Treaty of Pereyaslav</a>, the geopolitical map of the region changed. Russia entered the scene, and the Cossacks' former allies, the Tatars, had gone over to the Polish side and initiated warfare against Khmelnytsky. <a href="Tatar%20invasions">Tatar raids</a> depopulated whole areas of Ukraine. Cossacks, aided by the Tsar's army, took revenge on Polish possessions in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, and in the spring of 1654, the Cossacks drove the Poles from much of the country. Sweden entered the mêlée. Old adversaries of both Poland and Russia, they occupied a share of Lithuania before the Russians could get there.

The occupation displeased Russia because the tsar sought to take over the Swedish Baltic provinces. In 1656, with the Commonwealth increasingly war-torn but also increasingly hostile and successful against the Swedes, the ruler of <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, <a href="George%20II%20R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi">George II Rákóczi</a>, also joined in. <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20Sweden">Charles X of Sweden</a> had solicited his help because of the massive Polish popular opposition and resistance against the Swedes. Under blows from all sides, the Commonwealth barely survived.

Russia attacked Sweden in July 1656, while its forces were deeply involved in Poland. That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord. In addition to diplomatic tensions between the tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced. In particular, they concerned Russian officials' interference in the finances of the <a href="Cossack%20Hetmanate">Cossack Hetmanate</a> and in the newly captured Belarus. The tsar concluded a separate treaty with the Poles in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> in 1656. The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations.

Khmelnytsky wrote an irate letter to the tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement. He compared the Swedes to the tsar and said that the former were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians.

In Poland, the Cossack army and Transylvanian allies suffered a number of setbacks. As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front. Troubling news also came from Crimea, as Tatars, in alliance with Poland, were preparing for a new <a href="invasion">invasion</a> of Ukraine. Though already ill, Khmelnytsky continued to conduct diplomatic activity, at one point even receiving the tsar's envoys from his bed.

On 22 July, he suffered a <a href="cerebral%20hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a> and became paralysed after his audience with the Kiev Colonel Zhdanovich. His expedition to <a href="Halychyna">Halychyna</a> had failed because of mutiny within his army. Less than a week later, Bohdan Khmelnytsky died at 5 a.m. on 27 July 1657. His funeral was held on 23 August, and his body was taken from his capital, Chyhyryn, to his estate, at Subotiv, for burial in his ancestral church. In 1664 a Polish hetman <a href="Stefan%20Czarniecki">Stefan Czarniecki</a> recaptured Subotiv, which according to some Ukrainian historians, ordered the bodies of the hetman and his son, <a href="Tymofiy%20Khmelnytsky">Tymish</a>, to be exhumed and desecrated, while others claim that is not the case.

Khmelnytsky had a crucial influence on the history of Ukraine. He not only shaped the future of Ukraine but affected the <a href="balance%20of%20power%20in%20international%20relations">balance of power</a> in Europe, as the weakening of Poland-Lithuania was exploited by Austria, Saxony, Prussia, and Russia. His actions and role in events were viewed differently by different contemporaries, and even now there are greatly differing perspectives on his legacy.

In Ukraine, Khmelnytsky is generally regarded as a national hero. A <a href="Khmelnytskyi%2C%20Ukraine">city</a> and a <a href="Khmelnytskyi%20Oblast">region</a> of the country bear his name. His image is prominently displayed on Ukrainian <a href="banknote">banknote</a>s and his <a href="Bohdan%20Khmelnytsky%20Monument%2C%20Kiev">monument</a> in the centre of Kiev is the focal point of the Ukrainian capital. There have also been several issues of the <a href="Order%20of%20Bohdan%20Khmelnytsky">Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky</a> — one of the highest decorations in Ukraine and in the former Soviet Union.

However, with all this positive appreciation of his legacy, even in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> it is far from being unanimous. He is criticised for his union with Russia, which in the view of some, proved to be disastrous for the future of the country. Prominent Ukrainian poet, <a href="Taras%20Shevchenko">Taras Shevchenko</a>, was one of Khmelnytsky's very vocal and harsh critics. Others criticize him for his alliance with the Crimean Tatars, which permitted the latter to take a large number of Ukrainian peasants as slaves. (The Cossacks as a military caste did not protect the 'kholopy', the lowest stratum of the Ukrainian people). Folk songs capture this. On the balance, the view of his legacy in present-day Ukraine is more positive than negative, with some critics acknowledging that the union with Russia was dictated by necessity and an attempt to survive in those difficult times.

Khmelnytsky's role in the history of the Polish State has been viewed mostly in a negative light. The rebellion of 1648 proved to be the end of the <a href="Golden%20Age">Golden Age</a> of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a> and the beginning of its demise. Although it survived the rebellion and the following attacks, within 100 years it was divided among Russia, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="Austria">Austria</a> in the <a href="partitions%20of%20Poland">partitions of Poland</a>. Many blamed Khmelnytsky for the decline of the Commonwealth. Polish historians such as <a href="Ludwik%20Kubala">Ludwik Kubala</a> compared Khmelnytsky with the influence of <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> in England.

Khmelnytsky has been a subject to several works in the 19th century Polish literature, but the most notable treatment of him in <a href="Polish%20literature">Polish literature</a> is found in <a href="Henryk%20Sienkiewicz">Henryk Sienkiewicz</a>'s "<a href="With%20Fire%20and%20Sword">With Fire and Sword</a>". The rather critical portrayal of him by Sienkiewicz has been moderated in the <a href="With%20Fire%20and%20Sword%20%28film%29">1999 movie adaptation</a> by <a href="Jerzy%20Hoffman">Jerzy Hoffman</a>.

The official Russian <a href="historiography">historiography</a> stressed the fact that Khmelnytsky entered into union with Moscow's Tsar <a href="Alexei%20Mikhailovich">Alexei Mikhailovich</a> with an expressed desire to "re-unify" Ukraine with Russia. This view corresponded with the official theory of Moscow as an heir of the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, which appropriately gathered its former territories.

Khmelnytsky was viewed as a national hero of Russia for bringing Ukraine into the "eternal union" of all the Russias — Great, Little and White Russia. As such, he was much respected and venerated in Imperial Russia. His role was presented as a model for all Ukrainians to follow: to aspire for closer ties with Great Russia. This view was expressed in a monument commissioned by the Russian nationalist <a href="Mikhail%20Yuzefovich">Mikhail Yuzefovich</a>, which was installed in the centre of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> in 1888.

Russian authorities decided the original version of the monument (created by Russian sculptor <a href="Mikhail%20Mikeshin">Mikhail Mikeshin</a>) was too <a href="xenophobic">xenophobic</a>; it was to depict a vanquished Pole, Jew, and a Catholic priest under the hoofs of the horse. The inscription on the monument reads "To Bohdan Khmelnitsky from one and indivisible Russia." Mikeshin also created the Monument to the Millennium of Russia in <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>, which has Khmelnytsky shown as one of Russia's prominent figures.

<a href="Soviet%20historiography">Soviet historiography</a> followed in many ways the Imperial Russian theory of re-unification while adding the <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a> dimension to the story. Khmelnytsky was praised not only for re-unifying Ukraine with Russia, but also for organizing the class struggle of oppressed Ukrainian peasants against Polish exploiters.

The assessment of Khmelnytsky in <a href="Jewish%20history">Jewish history</a> is overwhelmingly negative because he used Jews as scapegoats and sought to eradicate Jews from Ukraine. The <a href="Khmelnytsky%20Uprising">Khmelnytsky Uprising</a> led to the deaths of an estimated 18,000-100,000 Jews. Atrocity stories about massacre victims who had been buried alive, cut to pieces or forced to kill one another spread throughout Europe and beyond. The pogroms contributed to a revival of the ideas of <a href="Isaac%20Luria">Isaac Luria</a>, who revered the <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, and the identification of <a href="Sabbatai%20Zevi">Sabbatai Zevi</a> as the Messiah. <a href="Orest%20Subtelny">Orest Subtelny</a> writes:
Between 1648 and 1656, tens of thousands of Jews—given the lack of reliable data, it is impossible to establish more accurate figures—were killed by the rebels, and to this day the Khmelnytsky uprising is considered by Jews to be one of the most traumatic events in their history.

Battle of Okinawa

The (), codenamed Operation Iceberg, was a major battle of the Pacific War fought on the island of <a href="Okinawa%20Island">Okinawa</a> by United States Marine and Army forces against the Imperial Japanese Army and included the largest <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">amphibious assault</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the April 1, 1945, invasion of Okinawa itself. The 82-day battle lasted from April 1 until June 22, 1945. After a long campaign of <a href="Leapfrogging%20%28military%29">island hopping</a>, the Allies were planning to use Okinawa, a large island only away from mainland Japan, as a <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">base for air operations</a> for the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">planned invasion</a> of the <a href="Japanese%20home%20islands">Japanese home islands</a>.

The United States created the <a href="Tenth%20United%20States%20Army">Tenth Army</a>, a cross-branch force consisting of the <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">7th</a>, <a href="27th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">27th</a>, <a href="77th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">77th</a>, and <a href="96th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">96th</a> infantry divisions of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> with the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st</a>, <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd</a>,and <a href="6th%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">6th</a> divisions of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a>, to fight on the island. The Tenth was unique in that it had its own tactical air force (joint Army-Marine command), and was also supported by combined naval and amphibious forces.

The battle has been referred to as the "typhoon of steel" in English, and "tetsu no ame" ("rain of steel") or "tetsu no bōfū" ("violent wind of steel") in Japanese.<ref name="VeteransRH/R"></ref> The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of Japanese <a href="Kamikaze%23Final%20phase">"kamikaze" attacks</a>, and the sheer numbers of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000+ casualties on both sides: 75,682 Allied and 84,166-117,000+ Japanese, including drafted <a href="Ryukyuan%20people">Okinawans</a> wearing Japanese uniforms. 149,425 Okinawans were killed, committed suicide or went missing, a significant proportion of the estimated pre-war 300,000 local population.

In the naval operations surrounding the battle, both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft, including the Japanese battleship <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Yamato">"Yamato"</a>. After the battle, Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan in preparation for the planned invasion.

The army had two <a href="corps">corps</a> under its command: the III Amphibious Corps, consisting of 1st and 6th Marine Divisions, and the XXIV Corps, consisting of the <a href="7th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">7th</a> and <a href="96th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">96th Infantry Divisions</a>. The 2nd Marine Division was an afloat reserve, and the 10th Army also controlled the <a href="27th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">27th Infantry Division</a>, earmarked as a <a href="garrison">garrison</a>, and the <a href="77th%20Sustainment%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">77th Infantry Divisions</a>.

In all, the Army had over 102,000 soldiers (of these, 38,000+ were non-divisional artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops), over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly <a href="Seabees">Seabees</a> and medical personnel). At the start of the Battle of Okinawa, the 10th Army had 182,821 personnel under its command. It was planned that General Buckner would report to Turner until the amphibious phase was completed, after which he would report directly to Spruance.

Although Allied land forces were entirely composed of American units, the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF; known to the US Navy as Task Force 57) provided about ¼ of Allied naval air power (450 planes). It comprised a force which included 50 warships, of which 17 were aircraft carriers; while the British <a href="armoured%20flight%20deck">armored flight decks</a> meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to "kamikaze" strikes.

Although all the aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a> fleet with British, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Canadian</a>, <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">New Zealand</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Australian</a> ships and personnel. Their mission was to neutralize Japanese <a href="Military%20airbase">airfields</a> in the <a href="Sakishima%20Islands">Sakishima Islands</a> and provide air cover against Japanese "kamikaze" attacks. Most of the air-to-air <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> and the small <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and <a href="Ground-attack%20aircraft">strike aircraft</a> were US Navy <a href="Aircraft%20carrier">carrier-based</a> airplanes.

The Japanese land <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> (mainly <a href="defense%20%28military%29">defensive</a>) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) <a href="regular%20army">regular</a> <a href="Thirty-Second%20Army%20%28Japan%29">32nd Army</a> and some 9,000 <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 <a href="Conscription">drafted</a> local <a href="Ryukyuan%20people">Ryukyuan people</a> (including 24,000 hastily drafted <a href="Rear%20%28military%29">rear</a> <a href="militia">militia</a> called "<a href="Boeitai">Boeitai</a>" and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). The Japanese had used "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" tactics since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major "kamikaze" attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes.

The 32nd Army initially consisted of the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">9th</a>, <a href="24th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">24th</a>, and <a href="62nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">62nd</a> Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to <a href="Taiwan%20%28island%29">Taiwan</a> before the <a href="invasion">invasion</a>, resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General <a href="Mitsuru%20Ushijima">Mitsuru Ushijima</a>, his <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="Isamu%20Ch%C5%8D">Isamu Chō</a> and his chief of operations, Colonel <a href="Hiromichi%20Yahara">Hiromichi Yahara</a>. Yahara advocated a defensive <a href="Military%20strategy">strategy</a>, whilst Chō advocated an <a href="Offensive%20%28military%29">offensive</a> one.

In the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Minoru%20%C5%8Cta">Minoru Ōta</a>. They expected the Americans to land 6–10 <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each US division five or six times the <a href="firepower">firepower</a> of a Japanese division. To this, would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.

In Okinawa island, <a href="middle%20school">middle school</a> boys were organized into <a href="front%20line">front-line</a>-service Tekketsu Kinnōtai, while <a href="Himeyuri%20students">Himeyuri students</a> were organized into a <a href="nurse">nursing</a> unit.

The <a href="Japanese%20Imperial%20Army">Japanese Imperial Army</a> mobilized 1,780 <a href="middle%20school">middle school</a> boys aged 14–17 years into front-line-service. They were named "Tekketsu Kinnōtai" (, Iron and Blood Imperial Corps). This mobilization was conducted by the ordinance of the Ministry of Army, not by law.

The ordinances mobilized the student as a volunteer soldier for form's sake. In reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to "volunteer" as soldiers. Sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents. About half of Tekketsu Kinnōtai were killed, including in suicide bomb attacks against tanks, and in guerrilla operations.

After losing the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. These laws made it possible for boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into <a href="front%20line">front-line</a>-service.

The United States Navy's Task Force 58, deployed to the east of Okinawa with a picket group of from 6 to 8 destroyers, kept 13 carriers (7 CVs and 6 CVLs) on duty from March 23 to April 27 and a smaller number thereafter. Until April 27, a minimum of 14 and up to 18 escort carriers (CVEs) were in the area at all times, and until April 20 British Task Force 57, with 4 large and 6 escort carriers, remained off the Sakishima Islands to protect the southern flank.

The protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a> to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, US naval forces began the campaign as the <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">US 5th Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="Raymond%20Spruance">Raymond Spruance</a>, but ended it as the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">3rd Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey">William Halsey</a>.

Japanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on April 6, the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period March 26 – April 30, twenty American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, by April 30, the Japanese had lost more than 1,100 planes to Allied naval forces alone.

Between April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 "kamikaze" aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual "kamikaze" sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual "kamikaze" sorties from <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>. While US intelligence estimated there were 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese actually had about 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the US <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> disputed Navy claims of "kamikaze" coming from Formosa.

The ships lost were smaller vessels, particularly the destroyers of the <a href="radar%20picket">radar picket</a>s, as well as <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a>s and landing ships. While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based <a href="Shin%27y%C5%8D-class%20suicide%20motorboat">Shin'yō-class suicide motorboat</a>s were also used in the Japanese <a href="suicide%20attack">suicide attack</a>s, although Ushijima had disbanded the majority of the suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.

Operation "Ten-Go" ("Ten-gō sakusen") was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the <a href="Dreadnought%23Super-dreadnoughts">super battleship</a> and commanded by <a href="List%20of%20Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20admirals">Admiral</a> <a href="Seiichi%20It%C5%8D">Seiichi Itō</a>. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach "Yamato" and fight from shore using her guns as <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> and crew as <a href="naval%20infantry">naval infantry</a>. The "Ten-Go" force was spotted by <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was intercepted by US carrier aircraft.

Under attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. US <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and hitting preferably the bow or stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest. Of "Yamato"'s screening force, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and 4 of the 8 destroyers were also sunk. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Admiral Itō, at the cost of 10 US aircraft and 12 airmen.

The <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>, taking part as Task Force 57, was assigned the task of neutralizing the Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, which it did successfully from March 26 to April 10. On April 10, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern <a href="Taiwan%20%28island%29">Formosa</a>. The force withdrew to <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a> on April 23.

On May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval <a href="bombardment">bombardment</a> as well as aircraft. Several "kamikaze" attacks caused significant damage, but since the British had armored <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a>s on their aircraft carriers, they experienced only a brief interruption to their force's operations.

The land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed in the <a href="Kerama%20Islands">Kerama Islands</a>, west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.

On March 31, Marines of the <a href="Fleet%20Marine%20Force%20Amphibious%20Reconnaissance%20Battalion">Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion</a> landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just west of the Okinawan capital of <a href="Naha%2C%20Okinawa">Naha</a>. A group of <a href="155%20mm%20Long%20Tom">"Long Tom"</a> artillery pieces went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa.

The main landing was made by the <a href="XXIV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XXIV Corps</a> and the <a href="III%20Amphibious%20Corps">III Amphibious Corps</a> on the Hagushi beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on L-Day, April 1, which was both Easter Sunday and <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> in 1945. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a <a href="demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a> off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to deceive the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of <a href="Military%20reserve">reserves</a> from there.

The 10th Army swept across the south-central part of the island with relative ease by World War II standards, capturing the <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">Kadena</a> and the <a href="Yomitan%2C%20Okinawa">Yomitan</a> airbases within hours of the landing. In light of the weak opposition, General Buckner decided to proceed immediately with Phase II of his plan—the seizure of northern Okinawa. The <a href="6th%20Marine%20Division">6th Marine Division</a> headed up the <a href="Ishikawa%20Isthmus">Ishikawa Isthmus</a> and by April 7, had sealed off the <a href="Motobu%20Peninsula">Motobu Peninsula</a>.

Six days later on April 13, the 2nd Battalion, <a href="22nd%20Marine%20Regiment">22nd Marine Regiment</a>, reached Hedo Point (<a href="Hedo-misaki">Hedo-misaki</a>) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed "Udo Force") was cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on <a href="Yae-Dake">Yae-Dake</a>, a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Dake on April 18.

Meanwhile, the <a href="77th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">77th Infantry Division</a> assaulted Ie Island (<a href="Ie%20Shima">Ie Shima</a>)—a small island off the western end of the peninsula—on April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered "kamikaze" attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before the area was declared secured on April 21, and became another air base for operations against Japan.

While the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the US Army 96th and 7th Infantry Divisions wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as <a href="Cactus%20Ridge">Cactus Ridge</a>. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed "<a href="The%20Pinnacle%2C%20Battle%20of%20Okinawa">The Pinnacle</a>"). By the night of April 8, American troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese, yet the battle had only begun, for it was now realized they were merely outposts guarding the Shuri Line.

The next American objective was <a href="Kakazu%20Ridge">Kakazu Ridge</a>, two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. American forces often lost personnel before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to obtain water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable, but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.

As the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Lieutenant General Ushijima — influenced by General Chō — decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked American positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce <a href="close%20combat">close combat</a>, the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The effort led the 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night <a href="infiltration%20tactics">infiltration tactics</a>, but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.

The 27th Infantry Division—which had landed on April 9—took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General <a href="John%20R.%20Hodge">John R. Hodge</a> now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th to the east, with each division holding a front of only about . Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific Ocean Theater</a>. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with <a href="napalm">napalm</a>, rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on <a href="reverse%20slope%20defence">reverse slopes</a>, where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.

A tank assault to achieve <a href="breakthrough%20%28military%29">breakthrough</a> by outflanking Kakazu Ridge failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge and failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although <a href="flame%20tank">flame tank</a>s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps suffered 720 casualties. The losses might have been greater, except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.

At the end of April, after Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line, the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 96th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, the III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and the 10th Army assumed control of the battle.

On May 4, the 32nd Army launched another <a href="counteroffensive">counteroffensive</a>. This time, Ushijima attempted to make <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious assaults</a> on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support, but effective American <a href="counter-battery%20fire">counter-battery fire</a> destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.

Buckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and <a href="763rd%20Tank%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">763rd Tank Battalion</a> captured Conical Hill. Rising above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions fought for "Sugar Loaf Hill". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.

By the end of May, monsoon rains which had turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> battlefield, as troops became mired in mud, and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew. Anyone sliding down the greasy slopes could easily find their pockets full of maggots at the end of the journey.

On May 29, Major General <a href="Pedro%20del%20Valle">Pedro del Valle</a>, commander of the 1st Marine Division, ordered Captain Julian D. Dusenbury of Company A, <a href="1st%20Battalion%205th%20Marines">1st Battalion</a>, <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marines</a>, to capture <a href="Shuri%20Castle">Shuri Castle</a>. Seizure of the castle represented both strategic and psychological blows for the Japanese and was a milestone in the campaign. Del Valle was awarded a <a href="Navy%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Distinguished Service Medal</a> for his leadership in the fight and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa. Captain Dusenbury would later receive the Navy Cross for his actions.

Shuri Castle had been shelled by the battleship for three days before this advance. Due to this, the 32nd Army withdrew to the south and thus the Marines had an easy task of securing Shuri Castle. The castle, however, was outside the 1st Marine Division's assigned zone and only frantic efforts by the commander and staff of the 77th Infantry Division prevented an American <a href="air%20strike">air strike</a> and artillery bombardment which would have resulted in many casualties due to <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>.

The Japanese retreat, although harassed by artillery fire, was conducted with great skill at night and aided by the monsoon storms. The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 personnel into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield.

On June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors, including Admiral <a href="Minoru%20%C5%8Cta">Minoru Ōta</a>, all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground naval headquarters on June 13. By June 17, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of <a href="Itoman">Itoman</a>.

On June 18, General Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire while monitoring the forward progress of his troops. Buckner was replaced by <a href="Roy%20Geiger">Roy Geiger</a>. Upon assuming command, Geiger became the only US Marine to command a numbered army of the US Army in combat; he was relieved five days later by <a href="Joseph%20Stilwell">Joseph Stilwell</a>.

The last remnants of Japanese resistance ended on June 21, although some Japanese continued hiding, including the future governor of <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa Prefecture</a>, <a href="Masahide%20%C5%8Cta">Masahide Ōta</a>. Ushijima and Chō committed suicide by "<a href="seppuku">seppuku</a>" in their command headquarters on Hill 89 in the closing hours of the battle. Colonel Yahara had asked Ushijima for permission to commit suicide, but the general refused his request, saying: "If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army Commander." Yahara was the most senior officer to have survived the battle on the island, and he later authored a book titled "The Battle for Okinawa". On August 15, 1945, Admiral <a href="Matome%20Ugaki">Matome Ugaki</a> was killed while part of a kamikaze raid on Iheyajima island. The official surrender ceremony was held on September 7, near <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">Kadena airfield</a>.

Okinawa was the bloodiest battle of the Pacific War. The most complete tally of deaths during the battle is at the <a href="Cornerstone%20of%20Peace">Cornerstone of Peace</a> monument at the Okinawa Prefecture Peace Park, which identifies the names of each individual who died at Okinawa in World War II. As of 2010, the monument lists 240,931 names, including 149,193 Okinawan civilians, 77,166 Imperial Japanese soldiers, 14,009 American soldiers, and smaller numbers of people from <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> (365), the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (82), <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> (82) and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> (34).

The numbers correspond to recorded deaths during the Battle of Okinawa from the time of the American <a href="Amphibious%20warfare">landings</a> in the <a href="Kerama%20Islands">Kerama Islands</a> on March 26, 1945, to the signing of the <a href="Japanese%20surrender">Japanese surrender</a> on September 2, 1945, in addition to all Okinawan casualties in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in the fifteen years from the <a href="Manchurian%20Incident">Manchurian Incident</a>, along with those who died in Okinawa from war-related events in the year before the battle and the year after the surrender. 234,183 names were inscribed by the time of unveiling and new names are added each year. Forty thousand of the Okinawan civilians killed had been drafted or impressed by the Japanese army and are often counted as combat deaths.

The Americans suffered over 82,000 casualties, including non-battle casualties (psychiatric, injuries, illnesses), of whom over 12,500 were killed or missing. Battle deaths were 4,907 Navy, 4,675 Army, and 2,938 Marine Corps personnel. Several thousand personnel who died indirectly (from wounds and other causes) at a later date are not included in the total.

The most famous American casualty was Lieutenant General <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner%20Jr.">Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr.</a>, whose decision to attack the Japanese defenses head-on, although extremely costly in American lives, was ultimately successful. Four days from the closing of the campaign, Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire, which blew lethal slivers of coral into his body, while inspecting his troops at the front line. He was the highest-ranking US officer to be killed by enemy fire during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The day after Buckner was killed, Brigadier General <a href="Claudius%20Miller%20Easley">Claudius Miller Easley</a> was killed by machine gun fire. The famous <a href="Journalist">war correspondent</a> <a href="Ernie%20Pyle">Ernie Pyle</a>, was killed by Japanese sniper fire on Ie Island (Ie Shima, a small island just off of northwestern Okinawa).

Aircraft losses over the three-month period were 768 US planes, including those bombing the Kyushu airfields launching "kamikaze"s. Combat losses were 458, and the other 310 were operational accidents. On land, at least 225 tanks and many <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">LVTs</a> were lost. At sea, 368 Allied ships—including 120 amphibious craft—were damaged while another 36—including 15 amphibious ships and 12 destroyers—were sunk during the Okinawa campaign. The US Navy's dead exceeded its wounded, with 4,907 killed and 4,874 wounded, primarily from "kamikaze" attacks.

American personnel casualties included thousands of cases of mental breakdown. According to the account of the battle presented in "<a href="Marine%20Corps%20Gazette">Marine Corps Gazette</a>":

Medal of Honor recipients from Okinawa are:

The US military estimates that 110,071 Japanese soldiers were killed during the battle. This total includes conscripted Okinawan civilians.

A total of 7,401 Japanese regulars and 3,400 Okinawan conscripts surrendered or were captured during the battle. Additional Japanese and renegade Okinawans were captured or surrendered over the next few months, bringing the total to 16,346. This was the first battle in the Pacific War in which thousands of Japanese soldiers surrendered or were captured. Many of the prisoners were native Okinawans who had been pressed into service shortly before the battle, and were less imbued with the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s no-surrender doctrine. When the American forces occupied the island, many Japanese soldiers put on Okinawan clothing to avoid capture, and some Okinawans would come to the Americans' aid by offering to identify these mainland Japanese.

The Japanese lost 16 combat vessels, including the super battleship "Yamato". Postwar examination of Japanese records revealed that Japanese aircraft losses at Okinawa were far below often-repeated US estimates for the campaign. The number of conventional and kamikaze aircraft actually lost or expended by the 3rd, 5th, and 10th Air Fleets, combined with about 500 lost or expended by the Imperial Army at Okinawa, was roughly 1,430. The Allies destroyed 27 Japanese tanks and 743 artillery pieces (including mortars, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns), some of them eliminated by the naval and air bombardments but most knocked out by American counter-battery fire.

Some of the other islands that saw major battles in World War II, such as <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a>, were uninhabited or had been evacuated. Okinawa, by contrast, had a large <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> civilian population; US Army records from the planning phase of the operation make the assumption that Okinawa was home to about 300,000 civilians. According to various estimates, between a tenth and a third of them died during the battle, between 30,000 and 100,000. Okinawa Prefecture's estimate is over 100,000 losses, while the official US Army count for the 82-day campaign is a total of 142,058 civilian casualties, including those killed by artillery fire, air attacks, and those <a href="Impressment">pressed into service</a> by the Imperial Japanese Army.

During the battle, American soldiers found it difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became common for them to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote: 

There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians – and we didn't care. It was a terrible thing not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately. 

In its history of the war, the <a href="Okinawa%20Prefectural%20Peace%20Memorial%20Museum">Okinawa Prefectural Peace Memorial Museum</a> presents Okinawa as being caught between the United States and the Empire of Japan. During the 1945 battle, the Japanese Army showed indifference to Okinawans' safety, and its soldiers even used civilians as human shields or just outright murdered them. The Japanese military <a href="Confiscation">confiscated</a> food from the Okinawans and executed those who hid it, leading to mass <a href="starvation">starvation</a>, and forced civilians out of their shelters. Japanese soldiers also killed about 1,000 people who spoke in the <a href="Okinawan%20language">Okinawan language</a> to suppress spying. The museum writes that "some were blown apart by [artillery] shells, some finding themselves in a hopeless situation were driven to suicide, some died of starvation, some succumbed to <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, while others fell victim to the retreating Japanese troops."

With the impending Japanese defeat, civilians often committed <a href="mass%20suicide">mass suicide</a>, urged on by the Japanese soldiers who told locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and raping. "<a href="Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB%20Shimp%C5%8D">Ryūkyū Shimpō</a>", one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote in 2007: "There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide. There are also people who have testified that they were handed grenades by Japanese soldiers" to blow themselves up. Thousands of civilians, having been induced by <a href="Japanese%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">Japanese propaganda</a> to believe that American soldiers were <a href="barbarian">barbarian</a>s who committed horrible atrocities, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture. Some of them threw themselves and their family members from the southern cliffs where the Peace Museum now resides. Okinawans "were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy". "Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power" by <a href="Mark%20Selden">Mark Selden</a> notes that the Americans "did not pursue a policy of torture, rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned". American <a href="Military%20Intelligence%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Military Intelligence Corps</a> combat translators such as <a href="Teruto%20Tsubota">Teruto Tsubota</a> managed to convince many civilians not to kill themselves. Survivors of the mass suicides blamed also the <a href="indoctrination">indoctrination</a> of their education system of the time, in which the Okinawans were taught to become "more Japanese than the Japanese", and were expected to prove it.

Witnesses and historians reported that soldiers, mainly Japanese troops, raped Okinawan women during the battle. Rape by Japanese troops "became common" in June, after it became clear that the Japanese Army had been defeated. Marine Corps officials in Okinawa and Washington have said that they knew of no rapes by American personnel in Okinawa at the end of the war. There are, however, numerous credible testimony accounts which allege that a large number of <a href="Rape%20during%20the%20occupation%20of%20Japan%23Battle%20of%20Okinawa">rapes were committed by American forces</a> during the battle. This includes claimed rape after trading sexual favors or even marrying Americans, such as the alleged incident in the village of Katsuyama, where civilians said they had formed a vigilante group to <a href="Cave%20of%20the%20Negroes%20incident">ambush and kill three black American soldiers</a> whom they claimed would frequently rape the local girls there.

There is ongoing disagreement between Okinawa's local government and Japan's national government over the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides during the battle. In March 2007, the national <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%2C%20Culture%2C%20Sports%2C%20Science%20and%20Technology">Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</a> (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war to avoid being taken prisoner. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military. This move sparked widespread protests among Okinawans. In June 2007, the <a href="Okinawa%20Prefectural%20Assembly">Okinawa Prefectural Assembly</a> adopted a resolution stating, "We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again."

On September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest <a href="political%20rally">political rally</a> in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers regarding revising the account of the civilian suicides. The resolution stated, "It is an undeniable fact that the 'multiple suicides' would not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese military and any deletion of or <a href="Historical%20revisionism">revision</a> to (the descriptions) is a denial and distortion of the many testimonies by those people who survived the incidents." In December 2007, MEXT partially admitted the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides. The ministry's Textbook Authorization Council allowed the publishers to reinstate the reference that civilians "were forced into mass suicides by the Japanese military", on condition it is placed in sufficient context. The council report stated, "It can be said that from the viewpoint of the Okinawa residents, they were forced into the mass suicides." That was not enough for the survivors who said it is important for children today to know what really happened. 

The <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>-winning author <a href="Kenzabur%C5%8D%20%C5%8Ce">Kenzaburō Ōe</a> wrote a booklet which states that the mass suicide order was given by the military during the battle. He was sued by revisionists, including a wartime commander during the battle, who disputed this and wanted to stop publication of the booklet. At a court hearing, Ōe testified "Mass suicides were forced on Okinawa islanders under Japan's <a href="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> social structure that ran through the state of Japan, the Japanese armed forces and local garrisons." In March 2008, the <a href="Osaka%20Prefecture">Osaka Prefecture</a> Court ruled in favor of Ōe, stating, "It can be said the military was deeply involved in the mass suicides." The court recognized the military's involvement in the mass suicides and <a href="murder%E2%80%93suicide">murder–suicide</a>s, citing the testimony about the distribution of grenades for suicide by soldiers and the fact that mass suicides were not recorded on islands where the military was not stationed.

In 2012, Korean-Japanese director Pak Su-nam announced her work on the documentary "Nuchigafu" (Okinawan for "only if one is alive") collecting living survivors' accounts to show "the truth of history to many people", alleging that "there were two types of orders for 'honorable deaths'—one for residents to kill each other and the other for the military to kill all residents". In March 2013, Japanese textbook publisher Shimizu Shoin was permitted by MEXT to publish the statements that "Orders from Japanese soldiers led to Okinawans committing group suicide" and "The [Japanese] army caused many tragedies in Okinawa, killing local civilians and forcing them to commit mass suicide."

Ninety percent of the buildings on the island were destroyed, along with countless historical documents, artifacts, and cultural treasures, and the tropical landscape was turned into "a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots". The military value of Okinawa "exceeded all hope". Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan. The US cleared the surrounding waters of mines in <a href="Operation%20Zebra">Operation "Zebra"</a>, occupied Okinawa, and set up the <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20Administration%20of%20the%20Ryukyu%20Islands">United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands</a>, a form of military government, after the battle. In 2011, one official of the prefectural government told David Hearst of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>":

Mainline military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, as a means of avoiding the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">planned ground invasion of the Japanese mainland</a>. This view is explained by <a href="Victor%20Davis%20Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> in his book "Ripples of Battle":

More recent scholars <a href="Debate%20over%20the%20atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">debate</a> why Japan surrendered, attributing the surrender to reasons including the atomic bombings, the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">Soviet invasion of Manchuria</a>, and Japan's depleted resources.

In 1995, the Okinawa government erected a memorial monument named the <a href="Cornerstone%20of%20Peace">Cornerstone of Peace</a> in Mabuni, the site of the last fighting in southeastern Okinawa. The memorial lists all the known names of those who died in the battle, civilian and military, Japanese and foreign. As of June 2008, it contains 240,734 names.

Significant US forces remain garrisoned on Okinawa as the <a href="United%20States%20Forces%20Japan">United States Forces Japan</a>, which the Japanese government sees as an important guarantee of regional stability, and <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">Kadena</a> remains the largest US air base in Asia. Local residents have protested against the size and/or presence of the base.

<doc id="4988" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4988" title="Brezhnev Doctrine">
Brezhnev Doctrine

The Brezhnev Doctrine was a <a href="Soviet%20foreign%20policy">Soviet foreign policy</a>, first and most clearly outlined by Sergei Kovalev in a September 26, 1968 "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" article entitled "Sovereignty and the International Obligations of Socialist Countries". <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> reiterated it in a speech at the Fifth Congress of the <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a> on November 13, 1968, which stated: 

This doctrine was announced to retroactively justify the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in August 1968 that ended the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a>, along with earlier <a href="Soviet%20Armed%20Forces">Soviet military</a> interventions, such as the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">invasion of Hungary in 1956</a>. These interventions were meant to put an end to liberalization efforts and uprisings that had the potential to compromise Soviet <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> inside the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>, which was considered by the Soviets to be an essential defensive and strategic buffer in case hostilities with <a href="NATO">NATO</a> were to break out.

In practice, the policy meant that only limited independence of the <a href="satellite%20state">satellite state</a>s' communist parties was allowed and that no country would be allowed to compromise the cohesiveness of the Eastern Bloc in any way. That is, no country could leave the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> or disturb a ruling <a href="communist%20party">communist party</a>'s monopoly on power. Implicit in this doctrine was that the leadership of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> reserved, for itself, the power to define "<a href="socialism">socialism</a>" and "<a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>". Following the announcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine, numerous treaties were signed between the Soviet Union and its satellite states to reassert these points and to further ensure inter-state cooperation. The principles of the doctrine were so broad that the Soviets even used it to justify their military intervention in the non-Warsaw Pact nation of <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Afghanistan in 1979</a>. The Brezhnev Doctrine stayed in effect until it was ended with the <a href="Soviet%20reaction%20to%20the%20Polish%20crisis%20of%201980%E2%80%9381">Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–81</a>. <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> refused to use military force when <a href="Poland">Poland</a> held free elections in 1989 and <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a> defeated the <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a>. It was superseded by the facetiously named <a href="Sinatra%20Doctrine">Sinatra Doctrine</a> in 1989, alluding to the Frank Sinatra song "<a href="My%20Way">My Way</a>".

The period between 1953-1968 was saturated with dissidence and reformation within the Soviet satellite states. 1953 saw the death of Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin, followed closely by <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>’s ‘Secret Speech’ denouncing Stalin in 1956. This denouncement of the former leader led to a period of the Soviet Era known commonly as “De-Stalinization.” Under the blanket reforms of this process, <a href="Imre%20Nagy">Imre Nagy</a> came to power in Hungary as the new Prime Minister, taking over for <a href="M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s%20R%C3%A1kosi">Mátyás Rákosi</a>. Almost immediately Nagy set out on a path of reform. Police power was reduced, collectivized farms were breaking apart, industry and food production shifted and religious tolerance was becoming more prominent. These reforms shocked the <a href="Hungarian%20Communist%20Party">Hungarian Communist Party</a>. Nagy was quickly overthrown by Rákosi in 1955, and stripped of his political livelihood. Shortly after this coup, Khrushchev signed the <a href="Belgrade%20declaration">Belgrade Declaration</a> which stated “separate paths to socialism were permissible within the Soviet Bloc.” With hopes for serious reform just having been extinguished in Hungary, this declaration was not received well by the Hungarians. Tensions quickly mounted in Hungary with demonstrations and calls for not only the withdrawal of Soviet troops, but for a Hungarian withdrawal from the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> as well. By October 23 Soviet forces landed in Budapest. A chaotic and bloody squashing of revolutionary forces lasted from the October 24 until November 7. Although order was restored, tensions remained on both sides of the conflict. Hungarians resented the end of the reformation, and the Soviets wanted to avoid a similar crisis from occurring again anywhere in the socialist camp.

When the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution of 1956</a> ended, the Soviets adopted the mindset that governments supporting both <a href="Communism">Communism</a> and <a href="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> must coexist, and more importantly, build relations. The <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> called for a <a href="peaceful%20coexistence">peaceful coexistence</a>, where the war between the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> would come to a close. This ideal, further stressed that all people are equal, and own the right to solve the problems of their own countries themselves. The idea was that in order for both states to peacefully coexist, neither country can exercise the right to get involved in each other's internal affairs. The Soviets did not want the Americans getting into their business, as the Americans did not want the Soviets in theirs. While this idea was brought up following the events of <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, they were not put into effect for a great deal of time. This is further explained in the Renouncement section.

Notions of reform had been slowly growing in Czechoslovakia since the early-mid 1960s. However, once the Stalinist President <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Novotn%C3%BD">Antonín Novotný</a> resigned as head of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovak Communist Party</a> in January 1968, the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a> began to take shape. <a href="Alexander%20Dub%C4%8Dek">Alexander Dubček</a> replaced Novotný as head of the party, initially thought a friend to the Soviet Union. It was not long before Dubček began making serious liberal reforms. In an effort to establish what Dubček called “<a href="Socialism%20with%20a%20human%20face">developed socialism</a>”, he instituted changes in Czechoslovakia to create a much more free and liberal version of the socialist state. Aspects of a market economy were implemented, travel abroad became easier for citizens, state censorship loosened, the power of the secret police was limited, and steps were taken to improve relations with the west. As the reforms piled up, the Kremlin quickly grew uneasy as they hoped to not only preserve socialism within Czechoslovakia, but to avoid another Hungarian-style crisis as well. Soviet panic compounded in March of ’68 when student protests erupted in Poland and Antonín Novotný resigned as the Czechoslovak President. March 21 <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, the KGB Chairman, issued a grave statement concerning the reforms taking place under Dubček. “The methods and forms by which the work is progressing in Czechoslovakia remind one very much of Hungary. In this outward appearance of chaos…there is a certain order. It all began like this in Hungary also, but then came the first and second echelons, and then, finally the social democrats.”

<a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> sought clarification from Dubček on March 21, with the Politburo convened, on the situation in Czechoslovakia . Eager to avoid a similar fate as Imre Nagy, Dubček reassured Brezhnev that the reforms were totally under control and not on a similar path to those seen in 1956 in Hungary. Despite Dubček’s assurances, other socialist allies grew uneasy by the reforms taking place in an Eastern European neighbor. Namely, the Ukrainians were very alarmed by the Czechoslovak deviation from standard socialism. The First Secretary of the <a href="Ukrainian%20Communist%20Party">Ukrainian Communist Party</a> called on Moscow for an immediate invasion of Czechoslovakia in order to stop Dubček’s ‘socialism with a human face’ from spreading into Ukraine and sparking unrest. By May 6 Brezhnev condemned Dubček’s system, declaring it a step toward “the complete collapse of the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>.” After three months of negotiations, agreements, and rising tensions between Moscow and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion began on the night of August 20, 1968 which was to be met with great Czechoslovak discontent and resistance for many months into 1970.

Brezhnev realized the need for a shift from <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>’s idea of “different paths to socialism” towards one that fostered a more unified vision throughout the socialist camp. “Economic integration, political consolidation, a return to ideological orthodoxy, and inter-Party cooperation became the new watchwords of Soviet bloc relations.” On November 12, 1968 Brezhnev stated that “[w]hen external and internal forces hostile to socialism try to turn the development of a given socialist country in the direction of…the capitalist system...this is no longer merely a problem for that country’s people, but a common problem, the concern of all socialist countries.” Brezhnev’s statement at the <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Fifth Congress of the Polish United Workers Party</a> effectively classified the issue of sovereignty as less important than the preservation of international socialism. While no new doctrine had been officially announced, it was clear that Soviet intervention was imminent if Moscow perceived any country to be at risk of jeopardizing the integrity of socialism.

The vague, broad nature of the Brezhnev Doctrine allowed application to any international situation the USSR saw fit. This is clearly evident not only through the Prague Spring in 1968, and the indirect pressure on Poland from 1980–81, but also in the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan starting in the 1970s. Any instance which caused the USSR to question whether or not a country was becoming a risk to international socialism, the use of military intervention was, in Soviet eyes, not only justified, but necessary.

The Soviet government's desire to link its foreign policy to the Brezhnev Doctrine was evoked again when it ordered a military intervention in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in 1979. This was perhaps, the last chapter of this doctrine's saga. The political uneasiness in Afghanistan at the time, made it the perfect target for intervention. Strategically, it was in the Soviets’ best interests to make their way to Afghanistan if they wanted to expand their communist influence even further.

In April of that year, Afghanistan had two political groups facing deep struggle in efforts to get along with one another. It was this notion that provided <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> a soviet government in Afghanistan. Two groups that worked together as a part of this process were known as <a href="Khalq">Khalq</a> and <a href="Parcham">Parcham</a>. The Khalq in particular, held communist ideologies. In the fight for power, the communist Khalq became the leading force in the Afghanistan homeland, with Parcham getting pushed out of the equation in a falling out. Along with Parcham, their leader, <a href="Babrak%20Karmal">Babrak Karmal</a> was sent away. He did so to fill as the ambassador for the government in relations with eastern Europe. This was a huge victory for the Soviets, because they now had infrastructural power in Afghanistan. Islamic fundamentalists took issue with the Communist party taking charge. In result, they attempted to overthrow the Khalq leader, <a href="Hafizullah%20Amin">Hafizullah Amin</a>. However, the fundamentalists’ leader, <a href="Nur%20Muhammad%20Taraki">Nur Muhammad Taraki</a>, died instead. This was just one side effect of the failure of the fundamentalists’ rebellion.

Exploiting this turmoil, the Soviets, on December 27, 1979, had somewhere around 5,000 troops in Afghanistan. During his talks with the Soviets during his time as Ambassador, Karmal coordinated with the Soviet government. It was this coordination that led to both Soviet soldiers and airborne units attacking the Amin-lead Afghanistan government. In light of this attack, Amin ended up dead. The Soviets took it upon themselves to place their ally, former-Ambassador Babrak Karmal as the new lead of the government in Afghanistan.

The Soviet Union, once again, fell back to the Brezhnev Doctrine for rationale, claiming that it was both morally and politically justified. The Soviets also begged that it was out of protection of their Southern border. It was also explained by the Soviets that they owed help to their friend and ally Babrak Karmal. While the real reason seems to be for the sake of their own expansion, the world will never really know their exact intentions.

The long lasting struggle of the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">war in Afghanistan</a> made the Soviets realize that their reach and influence was in fact limited. “[The war in Afghanistan] had shown that socialist internationalism and Soviet national interests were not always compatible.” Tensions between the USSR and Czechoslovakia since 1968, as well as Poland in 1980, proved the inefficiencies inherent in the Brezhnev Doctrine. Although the Soviet Union wanted to preserve socialism in its allies, sometimes that proved easier said than done. Gorbachev’s Glasnost and Perestroika finally opened the door for Soviet Bloc countries and republics to make reforms without Soviet intervention.

On May 29, 1972, it was implied in an agreement between <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, that the Brezhnev Doctrine was to be repealed from the Soviets’ agenda. This was made possible because the Doctrine allegedly violated the sovereign equality of the socialist states that they were trying to manage. As the meeting between both political figures went on, the USSR accepted the agreement believing that the United States was planning to repeal the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>. This section of the <a href="Moscow%20Declarations">Moscow Declarations</a>, explained that as long as one country remained in accordance with the removal of their own explorational doctrine, then the other must abide as well. However, if that agreement was infringed upon, then the other country withheld the right to come back to their own doctrine, and enforce it as such. This was a sigh of relief for both the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and other regions that fell victim to the Brezhnev Doctrine, and <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. Latin Americans rejoiced as that meant they were free of situations like the incident that happened in the Dominican Republic.

The ultimate goal of this renouncement of both doctrines was to enact the idea of <a href="peaceful%20coexistence">peaceful coexistence</a>. However, the United States time and again had shown that while they agreed to the idea, they fled from any scenario that dealt with it. Brezhnev believed that while they were trying to exist peacefully together, it would not be possible. He was a firm believer that the two opposing ideas from both countries on matters such as social class would never mesh. Despite that thinking, the Soviet Union strongly pushed for the idea of peaceful coexistence to become a part of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a>. The United States continually insisted that this notion should not be allowed to happen. Many critics of this political behavior believe this to be one of the United States' most stubborn actions of <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> time.

With the agreement to terminate the Brezhnev Doctrine, later came on a new leader for the Soviets, <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>. The foreign policies of his <a href="Soviet-Russia">Soviet-Russia</a>, were much more relaxed. This is most likely due to the fact that Brezhnev Doctrine was no longer at the disposal of the Soviet Union. This had a major effect on the way that the Soviets carried out their new mentality when dealing with countries they once tried to control. This was best captured by Gorbachev's involvement with a group by the name of the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). This organization lessens the control that the Soviet's had on all other partners of the agreement. This notion provided other countries that were once oppressed under communist intervention, to go about their own <a href="political%20reform">political reform</a>. This actually carried over internally as well. In fact, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s biggest problem after the removal of the Brezhnev Doctrine, was the <a href="Khrushchev">Khrushchev</a> Dilemma. This did not address how to stop internal political reform, but how to tame the physical violence that comes along with it. It had become clear that the Soviet Union was beginning to loosen up.

It is possible to pinpoint the renouncement of the Brezhnev Doctrine as to what started the end for the Soviet Union. Countries that were once micromanaged now could do what they wanted to politically, because the Soviets could no longer try to conquer where they saw fit. With that, the Soviet Union began to collapse. While the communist agenda had caused infinite problems for other countries, it was the driving force behind the Soviet Union staying together. After all, it seems that the removal of the incentive to conquer, and forcing of communism upon other nations, defeated the one thing Soviet Russia had always been about, the expansion of Communism.

With the fall of the Brezhnev Doctrine, came the fall of the man, Brezhnev himself, the share of power in the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>, and perhaps the final moment for the Soviet Union, the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>. The Brezhnev Doctrine coming to a close, was perhaps the beginning of the end for one of the strongest empires in the world's history, the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union was not the only Socialist country to intervene militarily in fellow Socialist countries. Vietnam deposed the <a href="Khmer%20Rogue">Khmer Rogue</a> in the <a href="Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese%20War">Cambodian–Vietnamese War</a> of 1978, which was followed by a revenge Chinese invasion of Vietnam in the <a href="Sino-Vietnamese%20War">Sino-Vietnamese War</a> of 1979.

This doctrine was even furthermore a problem in the view of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. The UN's first problem was that it permits use of force. This is a clear violation of Article 2, Chapter 4 of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Charter">United Nations Charter</a> which states, “All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” When international law conflicts with the Charter, the Charter has precedent. It is this, that makes the Brezhnev Doctrine illegal.

The Brezhnev Doctrine is essentially a Soviet version of the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>. This perhaps is best exemplified by a connection between American intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965 and the invasion of <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> by the Soviets in 1968. Both events are extremely similar in the fact that they used a set of doctrines to justify their actions. 

Despite their likenesses, there are some strong distinctions between the two. During the Soviets’ invasion, 500,000 soldiers were sent. This is a much higher number than the 14,000 that America sent to the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. The Soviets seemed to only invade Czechoslovakia out of their own communist agenda. The United States only intervened out of their containment philosophy. In general, the US only intervened in the Dominican Republic to give the people of the country the "opportunity" to choose how their government would function; hoping the Dominican Republic would tend towards capitalism, a system that is benefited by more countries of the same system. Additionally, the Dominican Republic requested America’s help.

Bain-marie

A bain-marie (; also known as a water bath or double boiler), a type of <a href="heated%20bath">heated bath</a>, is a piece of equipment used in <a href="science">science</a>, <a href="industry">industry</a>, and <a href="cooking">cooking</a> to heat materials gently and gradually to fixed temperatures, or to keep materials warm over a period of time. A bain-marie is also used to melt ingredients for cooking.

The double boiler comes in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and types, but traditionally is a wide, cylindrical, usually metal container made of three or four basic parts: a handle, an outer (or lower) container that holds the working fluid, an inner (or upper), smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked, and sometimes a base underneath. Under the outer container of the bain-marie (or built into its base) is a heat source.

Typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working fluid.

The smaller container, filled with the substance to be heated, fits inside the outer container filled with the working fluid (usually water), and the whole is heated at, or below, the base, causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed. The insulating action of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or scorching.

When the working fluid is water and the bain-marie is used at <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees Celsius (212 °F), the boiling point of water at sea level. Using different working fluids (oils, salt solutions, etc.) in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures.

A contemporary alternative to the traditional, liquid-filled bain-marie is the electric "dry-heat" bain-marie, <a href="heating%20element">heated by elements</a> below both pots. The dry-heat form of electric bains-marie often consumes less energy, requires little cleaning, and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions. They can also operate at higher temperatures, and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts.

Electric bains-marie can also be wet, using either hot water or vapor, or steam, in the heating process. The open, bath-type bain-marie heats via a small, hot-water tub (or "bath"), and the vapour-type bain-marie heats with scalding-hot steam.


In small scale soap-making, a bain-marie's inherent control over maximum temperature makes it optimal for liquefying <a href="melt-and-pour%20soap">melt-and-pour soap</a> bases prior to molding them into bars. It offers the advantage of maintaining the base in a liquid state, or reliquefying a solidified base, with minimal deterioration. Similarly, using a water bath, traditional wood glue can be melted and kept in a stable liquid state over many hours without damage to the animal proteins it incorporates.

The name comes from the medieval-<a href="Latin">Latin</a> term "balneum" (or "balineum") "Mariae"—literally, "Mary's bath"—from which the <a href="French%20language">French</a> "bain de Marie", or "bain-marie", is derived. The device's invention has been popularly attributed to <a href="Mary%20the%20Jewess">Mary the Jewess</a>, an ancient alchemist. However, the water bath was known many centuries earlier (<a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> and <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>).

Ballu tundu

Ballu tundu or ballu bardu is a traditional <a href="Italian%20folk%20dance%23Sardinia">Sardinian folk dance</a> which is typically danced in a closed or open circle. The dance was described as early as 1805 by Mameli and by <a href="Alfonso%20Ferrero%20La%20Marmora">La Marmora</a> in 1825. In northern and central Sardinia, the dance is lively and animated with leaps and agile movements and usually accompanied by a choir of three or more singers in the center of the circle. In other areas, the dance is done to "<a href="launeddas">launeddas</a>" and the shepherd's "sulittu" but the accordion had also made its appearance by the 19th century. The Introduction is in <a href="Time_signature%23Most_frequent_time_signatures"></a> time but the dance itself is done in <a href="Time_signature%23Most_frequent_time_signatures"></a>.

At least in the past, the manner of holding hands was very important and followed strict rules. Married or engaged couples could hold hands palm to palm with fingers entwined, but a man could not do this with a young girl or another man's wife. If a stranger entered the circle, he had to do so to the woman's right so as not to come between her and her husband.

Barbagia

Barbagia ( or ) is a mountain area of inner <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>. It is a <a href="natural%20region">natural region</a> mostly contained in the <a href="province%20of%20Nuoro">province of Nuoro</a> and located alongside the <a href="Gennargentu">Gennargentu</a> massif.

The name comes from <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, who described it as a land of <a href="barbarians">barbarians</a> ("Barbaria", Βαρβαρία in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>). This word derives from the Greek Βάρβαρος, which means "stuttering". The inhabitants were also known, by the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Romans</a>, with the pejorative term "latrones mastrucati", which means "thieves with a rough garment in wool". Roman domination in this area of Sardinia was never more than nominal.

In 594, Pope <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a> wrote a letter to <a href="Hospito">Hospito</a>, a Christian whom he calls the "leader of the Barbaricini" ("dux barbaricinorum"). Hospito apparently permitted the evangelisation of pagan Barbagia by Christian missionaries.

The area is usually divided into four Barbagias: the Barbagia di <a href="Ollolai">Ollolai</a>, the <a href="Barbagia%20di%20Seulo">Barbagia di Seulo</a>, the <a href="Barbagia%20di%20Belv%C3%AC">Barbagia di Belvì</a> and the <a href="Mandrolisai">Mandrolisai</a>. The latter is named after a sub-region, and the others after their main villages.

The area is full of hard hills, and there is little human presence. Barbagia is one of the least populated areas in Europe, which has allowed Barbagia to preserve its cultural and natural treasures. Barbagia is one of the few, if not the only Sardinian region, where <a href="Sardinian%20language">Sardinian language</a> and its internal varieties (both <a href="Logudorese%20dialect">Nuorese</a> and <a href="Campidanese%20dialect">Campidanese</a> dialects) is still spoken on an everyday basis, while the rest of the island has already undergone <a href="language%20shift">shift</a> to Italian.

One of the most important villages is <a href="Gavoi">Gavoi</a>. <a href="Orgosolo">Orgosolo</a> was famous for its bandits and kidnappers and typical <a href="murals">murals</a>. <a href="Oliena">Oliena</a> is well known for its <a href="wine">wine</a>s (especially the Nepente, a wine made with <a href="Cannonau">Cannonau</a> grapes). Another well known town is <a href="Fonni">Fonni</a>, the highest town in Sardinia at more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Fonni is also the gateway to the Gennargentu mountain system.

The economy consists of agriculture, sheep breeding, art and tradition related business, tourism and light industry.

Brabham

Motor Racing Developments Ltd., commonly known as Brabham , was a British <a href="race%20car">racing car</a> manufacturer and <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> racing team. Founded in 1960 by two Australians, driver <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a> and designer <a href="Ron%20Tauranac">Ron Tauranac</a>, the team won four <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Drivers'</a> and two <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">Constructors'</a> World Championships in its 30-year Formula One history. Jack Brabham's 1966 Drivers' Championship remains the only such achievement using a car bearing the driver's own name.

In the 1960s, Brabham was the world's largest manufacturer of <a href="open%20wheel%20car">open-wheel racing cars</a> for sale to customer teams, and had built more than 500 cars by 1970. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a> and <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a>. Brabham cars also competed in the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a> and in <a href="Formula%205000">Formula 5000</a> racing. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced innovations such as the <a href="Gordon%20Murray">Gordon Murray</a> designed "<a href="fan%20car">fan car</a>"—which won its only race before being withdrawn—in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and <a href="hydropneumatic%20suspension">hydropneumatic suspension</a>.

The team won two more Formula One Drivers' Championships in the 1980s with Brazilian <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a>. He won his first championship in in the <a href="Ground%20effect%20%28cars%29">Ground effects</a> <a href="Brabham%20BT49">BT49</a>-<a href="Cosworth%20DFV">Ford</a>, and became the first to win a Drivers' Championship with a <a href="turbocharger">turbocharged</a> car, in . In 1983 the <a href="Brabham%20BT52">Brabham BT52</a>, driven by Piquet and Italian <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a>, was powered by the <a href="BMW%20M12">BMW M12</a> <a href="straight-4">straight-4</a> engine, and powered Brabham to four of the team's 35 Grand Prix victories.

British businessman <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a> owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the <a href="1992%20Formula%20One%20season">1992 season</a>, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom <a href="Serious%20Fraud%20Office%20%28UK%29">Serious Fraud Office</a>. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the <a href="2010%20Formula%20One%20season">2010 Formula One season</a> using the Brabham name.

The Brabham team was founded by <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a> and <a href="Ron%20Tauranac">Ron Tauranac</a>, who met in 1951 while both were successfully building and racing cars in their native Australia. Brabham was the more successful driver and went to the United Kingdom in 1955 to further his racing career. There he started driving for the <a href="Cooper%20Car%20Company">Cooper Car Company</a> works team and by 1958 had progressed with them to Formula One, the highest category of <a href="open-wheel%20racing">open-wheel racing</a> defined by the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), motor sport's world governing body. In <a href="1959%20Formula%20One%20season">1959</a> and <a href="1960%20Formula%20One%20season">1960</a>, Brabham won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in Cooper's revolutionary <a href="mid-engine">mid-engine</a>d cars.

Despite their innovation of putting the engine behind the driver, the Coopers and their chief designer, <a href="Owen%20Maddock">Owen Maddock</a>, were generally resistant to developing their cars. Brabham pushed for further advances, and played a significant role in developing Cooper's highly successful 1960 T53 "lowline" car, with input from his friend Tauranac. Brabham was confident he could do better than Cooper, and in late 1959 he asked Tauranac to come to the UK and work with him, initially producing upgrade kits for <a href="Sunbeam%20Rapier">Sunbeam Rapier</a> and <a href="Triumph%20Herald">Triumph Herald</a> road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham describes Tauranac as "absolutely the only bloke I'd have gone into partnership with". Later, Brabham offered a Coventry-Climax FWE-engined version of the Herald, with and uprated suspension to match the extra power.

To meet that aim, Brabham and Tauranac set up Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), deliberately avoiding the use of either man's name. The new company would compete with Cooper in the market for customer racing cars; as Brabham was still employed by Cooper, Tauranac produced the first MRD car, for the entry level <a href="Formula%20Junior">Formula Junior</a> class, in secrecy. Unveiled in the summer of 1961, the "MRD" was soon renamed. Motoring journalist <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Crombac">Jabby Crombac</a> pointed out that "[the] way a Frenchman pronounces those initials—written phonetically, 'em air day'—sounded perilously like the French word... "."" Gavin Youl achieved a second-place finish at Goodwood and another at <a href="Mallory%20Park">Mallory Park</a> in the MRD-Ford. The cars were subsequently known as Brabhams, with type numbers starting with BT for "Brabham Tauranac".

By the <a href="1961%20Formula%20One%20season">1961 Formula One season</a>, the <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> and <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> teams had developed the mid-engined approach further than Cooper. Brabham had a poor season, scoring only four points, and—having run his own private Coopers in non-championship events during 1961—left the company in 1962 to drive for his own team: the Brabham Racing Organisation, using cars built by Motor Racing Developments. The team was based at <a href="Chessington">Chessington</a>, England and held the British nationality.

Motor Racing Developments initially concentrated on making money by building cars for sale to customers in lower formulae, so the new car for the Formula One team was not ready until partway through the <a href="1962%20Formula%20One%20season">1962 Formula One season</a>. The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding a customer <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> chassis, which was delivered at 3:00 am in order to keep it a secret. Brabham took two points finishes in Lotuses, before the turquoise-<a href="livery">liveried</a> Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the <a href="1962%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1962 German Grand Prix</a>. It retired with a <a href="throttle">throttle</a> problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places at the end of the season.
From the <a href="1963%20Formula%20One%20season">1963 season</a>, Brabham was partnered by American driver <a href="Dan%20Gurney">Dan Gurney</a>, the pair now running in Australia's <a href="List%20of%20international%20auto%20racing%20colors">racing colours</a> of green and gold. Brabham took the team's first win at the non-championship <a href="Solituderennen">Solitude Grand Prix</a> in 1963. Gurney took the <a href="marque">marque</a>'s first two wins in the world championship, at the 1964 <a href="1964%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French</a> and <a href="1964%20Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexican</a> Grands Prix. Brabham works and customer cars took another three non-championship wins during the <a href="1964%20Formula%20One%20season">1964 season</a>. The <a href="1965%20Formula%20One%20season">1965 season</a> was less successful, with no championship wins. Brabham finished third or fourth in the Constructors' Championship for three years running, but poor reliability marred promising performances on several occasions. Motor sport authors Mike Lawrence and David Hodges have said that a lack of resources may have cost the team results, a view echoed by Tauranac.

The FIA doubled the Formula One engine capacity limit to 3 litres for the <a href="1966%20Formula%20One%20season">1966 season</a> and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm <a href="Repco">Repco</a>, which had never produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 <a href="engine%20block">engine block</a>s from the defunct American <a href="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a> F85 road car project, and other off-the-shelf parts. Consulting and design engineer <a href="Phil%20Irving">Phil Irving</a> (of <a href="Vincent%20Motorcycle">Vincent Motorcycle</a> fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, but the light and reliable cars ran at the front from the start of the season. At the <a href="1966%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Reims-Gueux">Reims-Gueux</a>, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, <a href="Bruce%20McLaren">Bruce McLaren</a>, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name ("cf" <a href="Surtees">Surtees</a>, <a href="Hill%20%28constructor%29">Hill</a> and <a href="Fittipaldi%20Automotive">Fittipaldi Automotive</a>). In <a href="1967%20Formula%20One%20season">1967</a>, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander <a href="Denny%20Hulme">Denny Hulme</a>. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.

For <a href="1968%20Formula%20One%20season">1968</a>, Austrian <a href="Jochen%20Rindt">Jochen Rindt</a> replaced Hulme, who had left to join <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new <a href="Cosworth%20DFV">Cosworth DFV</a>, but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. The car was fast—Rindt set <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.
Although Brabham bought Cosworth DFV engines for the <a href="1969%20Formula%20One%20season">1969 season</a>, Rindt left to join Lotus. His replacement, <a href="Jacky%20Ickx">Jacky Ickx</a>, had a strong second half to the season, winning in <a href="1969%20German%20Grand%20Prix">Germany</a> and <a href="1969%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canada</a>, after Brabham was sidelined by a testing accident. Ickx finished second in the Drivers' Championship, with 37 points to <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a>'s 63. Brabham himself took a couple of pole positions and two top-3 finishes, but did not finish half the races. The team were second in the Constructors' Championship, aided by second places at <a href="1969%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a> and <a href="1969%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">Watkins Glen</a> scored by <a href="Piers%20Courage">Piers Courage</a>, driving a Brabham for the <a href="Frank%20Williams%20Racing%20Cars">Frank Williams Racing Cars</a> privateer squad.

Brabham intended to retire at the end of the 1969 season and sold his share in the team to Tauranac. However, Rindt's late decision to remain with Lotus meant that Brabham drove for another year. He took his last win in the opening race of the <a href="1970%20Formula%20One%20season">1970 season</a> and was competitive throughout the year, although mechanical failures blunted his challenge. Aided by number-two driver <a href="Rolf%20Stommelen">Rolf Stommelen</a>, the team came fourth in the Constructors' Championship.

Tauranac signed double world champion <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a> and young Australian <a href="Tim%20Schenken">Tim Schenken</a> to drive for the <a href="1971%20Formula%20One%20season">1971 season</a>. Tauranac designed the unusual 'lobster claw' BT34, featuring twin <a href="radiator%20%28engine%20cooling%29">radiator</a>s mounted ahead of the front wheels, a single example of which was built for Hill. Although Hill, no longer a front-runner since his 1969 accident, took his final Formula One win in the non-championship <a href="BRDC%20International%20Trophy">BRDC International Trophy</a> at <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a>, the team scored only seven championship points.

Tauranac, an engineer at heart, started to feel his Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble he could not afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman <a href="Bernie%20Ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a>, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the <a href="Connaught%20Engineering">Connaught</a> team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.

Tauranac left Brabham early in the <a href="1972%20Formula%20One%20season">1972 season</a> after Ecclestone changed the way the company was organised without consulting him. Ecclestone has since said "In retrospect, the relationship was never going to work", noting that "[Tauranac and I] both take the view: 'Please be reasonable, do it my way'". The highlights of an aimless year, during which the team ran three different models, were pole position for Argentinian driver <a href="Carlos%20Reutemann">Carlos Reutemann</a> at his home race at <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and a victory in the non-championship Interlagos Grand Prix. For the <a href="1973%20Formula%20One%20season">1973 season</a>, Ecclestone promoted the young South African engineer <a href="Gordon%20Murray">Gordon Murray</a> to chief designer and moved Herbie Blash from the Formula Two programme to become the Formula One team manager. Both would remain with the team for the next 15 years. For 1973, Murray produced the triangular cross-section BT42, with which Reutemann scored two podium finishes and finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship.

In the <a href="1974%20Formula%20One%20season">1974 season</a>, Reutemann took the first three victories of his Formula One career, and Brabham's first since 1970. The team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship, fielding the much more competitive <a href="Brabham%20BT44">BT44s</a>. After a strong finish to the 1974 season, many observers felt the team were favourites to win the <a href="1975%20Formula%20One%20season">1975 title</a>. The year started well, with a first win for Brazilian driver <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Pace">Carlos Pace</a> at the <a href="Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20Pace">Interlagos</a> circuit in his native <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>. However, as the season progressed, tyre wear frequently slowed the cars in races. Pace took another two podiums and finished sixth in the championship; while Reutemann had five podium finishes, including a dominant win in the <a href="1975%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1975 German Grand Prix</a>, and finished third in the Drivers' Championship. The team likewise ranked third in the Constructors' Championship at the end of the year.

While rival teams Lotus and McLaren relied on the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a competitive advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray's Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20Formula%20One">Alfa Romeo</a> to use their large and powerful <a href="flat-12">flat-12</a> engine from the <a href="1976%20Formula%20One%20season">1976 season</a>. The engines were free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red <a href="Martini%20Racing">Martini Racing</a> livery, unreliable and overweight. The 1976 and <a href="1977%20Formula%20One%20season">1977 seasons</a> saw Brabham fall toward the back of the field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract before the end of the 1976 season and signed with <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>. Ulsterman <a href="John%20Watson%20%28racing%20driver%29">John Watson</a> replaced him at Brabham for 1977. Watson lost near certain victory in the French Grand Prix (Dijon) of that year when his car ran low on fuel on the last lap and was passed by Mario Andretti's Lotus, with Watson's second place being the team's best result of the season. The car often showed at the head of races, but the unreliability of the Alfa Romeo engine was a major problem. The team lost Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a <a href="light%20aircraft">light aircraft</a> accident.

For the <a href="1978%20Formula%20One%20season">1978 season</a>, Murray's <a href="Brabham%20BT46">BT46</a> featured several new technologies to overcome the weight and packaging difficulties caused by the <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20Formula%20One">Alfa Romeo</a> engines. Ecclestone signed then two-time Formula One world champion <a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a> from Ferrari through a deal with Italian dairy products company <a href="Parmalat">Parmalat</a> which met the cost of Lauda ending his Ferrari contract and made up his salary to the £200,000 Ferrari was offering. 1978 was the year of the dominant <a href="Lotus%2079">Lotus 79</a> "wing car", which used <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> <a href="ground%20effect%20in%20cars">ground effect</a> to stick to the track when cornering, but Lauda won two races in the BT46, one with the controversial "B" or "<a href="Brabham%20BT46%23Brabham%20BT46B%20.E2.80.93%20the%20.22Fan%20car.22">fan car</a>" version.

The partnership with Alfa Romeo ended during the <a href="1979%20Formula%20One%20season">1979 season</a>, the team's first with young Brazilian driver <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a>. Murray designed the full-ground effect BT48 around a rapidly developed new Alfa Romeo V12 engine and incorporated an effective "carbon-carbon braking" system—<a href="%23Technical%20innovation">a technology Brabham pioneered in 1976</a>. However, unexpected movement of the car's aerodynamic <a href="center%20of%20pressure%20%28fluid%20mechanics%29">centre of pressure</a> made its handling unpredictable and the new engine was unreliable. The team dropped to eighth in the Constructors' Championship by the end of the season. Alfa Romeo started testing their own Formula One car during the season, prompting Ecclestone to revert to Cosworth DFV engines, a move Murray described as being "like having a holiday". The new, lighter, Cosworth-powered <a href="Brabham%20BT49">BT49</a> was introduced before the end of the year at the <a href="1979%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a>; where after practice Lauda announced his immediate retirement from driving, later saying that he "was no longer getting any pleasure from driving round and round in circles".

The team used the BT49 over four seasons. In the <a href="1980%20Formula%20One%20season">1980 season</a> Piquet scored three wins and the team took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the introduction of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the <a href="1981%20Formula%20One%20season">1981 season</a>, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid <a href="ride%20height">ride height</a> limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit <a href="%23Controversy">amid accusations of cheating</a>. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams team</a>.

<a href="Renault%20F1">Renault</a> had introduced <a href="turbocharged">turbocharged</a> engines to Formula One in 1977. Brabham had tested a <a href="BMW%20in%20Formula%20One">BMW</a> four-cylinder <a href="BMW%20M12">M12</a> turbocharged engine in the summer of 1981. For the <a href="1982%20Formula%20One%20season">1982 season</a> the team designed a new car, the BT50, around the BMW engine which, like the Repco engine 16 years before, was based on a road car engine block, the <a href="BMW%20M10">BMW M10</a>. Brabham continued to run the Cosworth-powered BT49D in the early part of the season while reliability and driveability issues with the BMW units were resolved. The relationship came close to ending, with the German manufacturer insisting that Brabham use their engine. The turbo car took its first win at the <a href="1982%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a>. In the Constructors' Championship, the team finished fifth, the drivers <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a>, who scored the last win of the Brabham-Ford combination in the <a href="1982%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>, 10th and World Champion Piquet a mere 11th in the Drivers' Championship. In the <a href="1983%20Formula%20One%20season">1983 season</a>, Piquet took the championship lead from <a href="Renault%20F1">Renault's</a> <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> at the last race of the year, the <a href="1983%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South African Grand Prix</a> to become the first driver to win the Formula One Drivers' World Championship with a turbo-powered car. The team did not win the Constructors' Championship in either 1981 or 1983, despite Piquet's success. <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a> was the only driver other than Piquet to win a race for Brabham in this period—the drivers in the second car contributed only a fraction of the team's points in each of these championship seasons. Patrese finished ninth in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points, dropping the team behind Ferrari and Renault to third in the Constructors' Championship.

Piquet took the team's last wins: two in 1984 by winning the seventh and eighth races of that season, the <a href="1984%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="1984%20Detroit%20Grand%20Prix">Detroit Grand Prix</a>, and one in 1985 by winning the <a href="1985%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, before reluctantly leaving for the <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> team at the end of the season. After seven years and two world championships, he felt he was worth more than Ecclestone's salary offer for 1986. Piquet finished fifth in 1984 and a mere eighth in 1985 in the respective Drivers' Championships. The <a href="1986%20Formula%20One%20season">1986 season</a> was a disaster for Brabham. Murray's radical long and low <a href="Brabham%20BT55">BT55</a>, with its BMW M12 engine tilted over to improve its aerodynamics and lower its centre of gravity, scored only two points. Driver <a href="Elio%20de%20Angelis">Elio de Angelis</a> became the Formula One team's only fatality when he died in a testing accident at the <a href="Circuit%20Paul%20Ricard">Paul Ricard</a> circuit. <a href="Derek%20Warwick">Derek Warwick</a>, who replaced de Angelis, was close to scoring two points for fifth in the <a href="1986%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a>, but a problem on the last lap dropped him out of the points. In August, BMW after considering running their own in-house team, announced their departure from Formula One at the end of the season. Murray, who had largely taken over the running of the team as Ecclestone became more involved with his role at the <a href="Formula%20One%20Constructors%20Association">Formula One Constructors Association</a>, felt that "the way the team had operated for 15 years broke down". He left Brabham in November to join <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a>.

Ecclestone held BMW to their contract for the <a href="1987%20Formula%20One%20season">1987 season</a>, but the German company would only supply the laydown engine. The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold for use by the <a href="Arrows%20%28F1%29">Arrows</a> team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the <a href="1987%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="1987%20Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a>. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending <a href="1988%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a>, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to <a href="EuroBrun">EuroBrun</a> team owner <a href="Walter%20Brun">Walter Brun</a> for an unknown price.

Brun soon sold the team on, this time to Swiss financier Joachim Luhti, who brought it back into Formula One for the <a href="1989%20Formula%20One%20season">1989 season</a>. The new <a href="Brabham%20BT58">Brabham BT58</a>, powered by a <a href="Judd%20%28engine%29">Judd</a> <a href="V8%20engine">V8 engine</a> (originally another of Jack Brabham's companies), was produced for the <a href="1989%20Formula%20One%20season">1989 season</a>. Italian driver <a href="Stefano%20Modena">Stefano Modena</a>, who had driven for the team in the <a href="1987%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1987 Australian Grand Prix</a> in a one off drive for the team, drove alongside the more experienced <a href="Martin%20Brundle">Martin Brundle</a> who was returning to Formula One after spending 1988 winning the <a href="1988%20World%20Sportscar%20Championship%20season">World Sportscar Championship</a> for <a href="Jaguar%20Cars">Jaguar</a>. Modena took the team's last podium: a third place at the <a href="1989%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> (Brundle, who had only just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds before qualifying a brilliant 4th, had been running third but was forced to stop to replace a flat battery, finally finishing sixth). The team also failed to make the grid sometimes: Brundle failed to prequalify at the <a href="1989%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="1989%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>. The team finished 9th in the Constructors' Championship at the end of the season.

After Luhti's arrest on tax fraud charges in mid-1989, several parties disputed the ownership of the team. Middlebridge Group Limited, a Japanese engineering firm owned by billionaire Koji Nakauchi, was already involved with established <a href="International%20Formula%203000">Formula 3000</a> team Middlebridge Racing and gained control of Brabham for the <a href="1990%20Formula%20One%20season">1990 season</a>. Herbie Blash had returned to run the team in 1989 and continued to do so in 1990. Middlebridge paid for its purchase using £1 million loaned to them by finance company Landhurst Leasing, but the team remained underfunded and would only score a few more points finishes in its last three seasons. Jack Brabham's youngest son, <a href="David%20Brabham">David</a>, raced for the Formula One team for a short time in 1990 including the season ending <a href="1990%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> (the first time a Brabham had driven a Brabham car in an <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> since <a href="1968%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1968</a>). 1990 was a disastrous year, with Modena's fifth place in the season opening <a href="1990%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">United States Grand Prix</a> being the only top six finish. The team finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship. Brundle and fellow Briton <a href="Mark%20Blundell">Mark Blundell</a>, scored only three points during the <a href="1991%20Formula%20One%20season">1991 season</a>. Due to poor results in the first half of 1991, they had to prequalify in the second half of the season, Blundell failed to do so in Japan, as did Brundle in Australia. The team finished 10th in the Constructors' Championship, behind another struggling British team, Lotus. In 1992, <a href="Damon%20Hill">Damon Hill</a>, the son of another former Brabham driver and World Champion, debuted in the team after <a href="Giovanna%20Amati">Giovanna Amati</a> was dropped when her sponsorship failed to materialise. Amati was the fifth woman to attempt a Formula One race, but her three attempts were unsuccessful.

Argentine <a href="Sergio%20Rinland">Sergio Rinland</a> designed the team's final cars around Judd engines, except for 1991 when <a href="Yamaha%20Motor%20Company%20Ltd.">Yamaha</a> powered the cars. In the <a href="1992%20Formula%20One%20season">1992 season</a> the cars (which were updated versions of the 1991 car) rarely qualified for races. Hill gave the team its final finish, at the <a href="1992%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungarian Grand Prix</a>, where he crossed the finish line 11th and last, four laps behind the winner, <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>. After the end of that race the team ran out of funds and collapsed. Middlebridge Group Limited had been unable to continue making repayments against the £6 million ultimately provided by Landhurst Leasing, which went into <a href="Administration%20order">administration</a>. The <a href="Serious%20Fraud%20Office%20%28UK%29">Serious Fraud Office</a> investigated the case. Landhurst's managing directors were found guilty of corruption and imprisoned, having accepted bribes for further loans to Middlebridge. It was one of four teams to leave Formula One that year. ("cf" <a href="March%20Engineering">March Engineering</a>, <a href="Fondmetal">Fondmetal</a> and <a href="Andrea%20Moda%20Formula">Andrea Moda Formula</a>). Although there was talk of reviving the team for the following year, its assets passed to Landhurst Leasing and were auctioned by the company's <a href="Administrative%20receivership">receivers</a> in 1993. Among these was the team's old factory in Chessington, which was acquired by Yamaha Motor Sports and used to house Activa Technology Limited, a company manufacturing composite components for race and road cars run by Herbie Blash. The factory was bought by the <a href="Carlin%20DPR">Carlin DPR</a> <a href="GP2%20Series">GP2</a> motor racing team in 2006.

On 4 June 2009, <a href="Franz%20Hilmer">Franz Hilmer</a> confirmed that he had used the name to lodge an entry for the 2010 Formula One season as a cost capped team under the new budget cap regulations. The Brabham family was not involved and announced that it was seeking legal advice over the use of the name. The team's entry was not accepted, and the Brabham family later obtained legal recognition of their exclusive rights to the Brabham brand.

In September 2014, <a href="David%20Brabham">David Brabham</a>—the son of Brabham founder <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Sir Jack Brabham</a>—announced the reformation of the Brabham Racing team under the name Project Brabham, with plans to enter the 2015 <a href="FIA%20World%20Endurance%20Championship">FIA World Endurance Championship</a> and 2015 <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> in the LMP2 category using a <a href="crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> business model. The team was also aiming to enter the <a href="FIA%20Formula%20E%20Championship">FIA Formula E Championship</a> and return to <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> in the future.

Brabham cars were also widely used by other teams, and not just in Formula One. Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build <a href="formula%20racing">formula racing</a> cars to customer teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50 percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply and the use of the MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.

From 1963 to 1965, MRD was not directly involved in Formula One, and often ran works cars in other formulae. A separate company, Jack Brabham's Brabham Racing Organisation, ran the Formula One works entry. Like other customers, BRO bought its cars from MRD, initially at £3,000 per car, although it did not pay for development parts. Tauranac was unhappy with his distance from the Formula One operation and before the 1966 season suggested that he was no longer interested in producing cars for Formula One under this arrangement. Brabham investigated other chassis suppliers for BRO, however the two reached an agreement and from 1966 MRD was much more closely involved in this category. After Jack Brabham sold his shares in MRD to Ron Tauranac at the end of 1969, the works Formula One team was MRD.

Despite only building its first car in 1961, by the mid-1960s MRD had overtaken established constructors like Cooper to become the largest manufacturer of single-seat racing cars in the world, and by 1970 had built over 500 cars. Of the other Formula One teams which used Brabhams, <a href="Frank%20Williams%20Racing%20Cars">Frank Williams Racing Cars</a> and the <a href="Rob%20Walker%20Racing%20Team">Rob Walker Racing Team</a> were the most successful. The <a href="1965%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1965 British Grand Prix</a> saw seven Brabhams compete, only two of them from the works team, and there were usually four or five at championship Grands Prix throughout that season. The firm built scores of cars for the lower formulae each year, peaking with 89 cars in 1966. Brabham had the reputation of providing customers with cars of a standard equal to those used by the works team, which worked "<a href="wiktionary%3Aout%20of%20the%20box">out of the box</a>". The company provided a high degree of support to its customers—including Jack Brabham helping customers set up their cars. During this period the cars were usually known as "Repco Brabhams", not because of the Repco engines used in Formula One between 1966 and 1968, but because of a smaller-scale sponsorship deal through which the Australian company had been providing parts to Jack Brabham since his Cooper days.

At the end of 1971 Bernie Ecclestone bought MRD. He retained the Brabham brand, as did subsequent owners. Although the production of customer cars continued briefly under Ecclestone's ownership, he believed the company needed to focus on Formula One to succeed. The last production customer Brabhams were the Formula Two BT40 and the Formula Three BT41 of 1973, although Ecclestone sold ex-works Formula One BT44Bs to <a href="RAM%20Racing">RAM Racing</a> as late as 1976.

In 1988 Ecclestone sold Motor Racing Developments to Alfa Romeo. The Formula One team did not compete that year, but Alfa Romeo put the company to use designing and building a prototype "Procar"—a racing car with the silhouette of a large saloon (the <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20164">Alfa Romeo 164</a>) covering a composite racing car chassis and mid mounted race engine. This was intended for a racing series for major manufacturers to support Formula One Grands Prix, and was designated the Brabham BT57.

Brabham cars competed at the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a> from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. After an abortive project in 1962, MRD was commissioned in 1964 to build an Indycar chassis powered by an American <a href="Offenhauser">Offenhauser</a> engine. The resultant BT12 chassis was raced by Jack Brabham as the "Zink-Urschel Trackburner" at the <a href="1964%20Indianapolis%20500">1964 event</a> and retired with a fuel tank problem. The car was entered again in <a href="1966%20Indianapolis%20500">1966</a>, taking a third place for <a href="Jim%20McElreath">Jim McElreath</a>. From 1968 to 1970, Brabham returned to Indianapolis, at first with a 4.2-litre version of the Repco V8 the team used in Formula One—with which <a href="Peter%20Revson">Peter Revson</a> finished fifth in 1969—before reverting to the Offenhauser engine for 1970. The Brabham-Offenhauser combination was entered again in 1971 by <a href="Christopher%20J.C.%20Agajanian">J.C. Agajanian</a>, finishing fifth in the hands of <a href="Bill%20Vukovich%20II">Bill Vukovich II</a>. Although no Brabham car ever won at Indianapolis, McElreath won four <a href="United%20States%20Automobile%20Club">United States Automobile Club</a> (USAC) races over 1965 and 1966 in the BT12. The "Dean Van Lines Special" in which <a href="Mario%20Andretti">Mario Andretti</a> won the 1965 USAC national championship was a direct copy of this car, made with permission from Brabham by Andretti's crew chief Clint Brawner. Revson took Brabham's final USAC race win in a BT25 in 1969, using the Repco engine.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often continued to compete in <a href="Formula%20Two">Formula Two</a>. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a <a href="Honda">Honda</a> engine acting as a stressed component. The car was extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races in the hands of the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.

The first <a href="Formula%20Three">Formula Three</a> Brabham, the BT9, won only four major races in 1964. The BT15 which followed in 1965 was a highly successful design. 58 cars were sold, which won 42 major races. Further developments of the same concept, including wings by the end of the decade, were highly competitive up until 1971. The BT38C of 1972 was Brabham's first production monocoque and the first not designed by Tauranac. Although 40 were ordered, it was less successful than its predecessors. The angular BT41 was the final Formula Three Brabham.

Brabham made one car for <a href="Formula%205000">Formula 5000</a> racing, the <a href="Brabham%20BT43">Brabham BT43</a>. Rolled out in late 1973 it was tested in early 1974 by John Watson at Silverstone before making its debut at the Rothmans F5000 Championship Round at Monza on June 30, 1974 driven by Martin Birrane. Former <a href="Australian%20Drivers%27%20Championship">Australian Drivers' Champion</a> <a href="Kevin%20Bartlett%20%28racing%20driver%29">Kevin Bartlett</a> used the <a href="Chevrolet%20small-block%20engine">Chevrolet</a> powered <a href="Brabham%20BT43">Brabham BT43</a> to finish 3rd in the <a href="1978%20Australian%20Drivers%27%20Championship">1978 Australian Drivers' Championship</a> including finishing 5th in the <a href="1978%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1978 Australian Grand Prix</a>.

Tauranac did not enjoy designing sports cars and could only spare a small amount of his time from MRD's very successful single-seater business. Only 14 sports car models were built between 1961 and 1972, out of a total production of almost 600 chassis. The BT8A was the only one built in any numbers, and was quite successful in national level racing in the UK in 1964 and 1965. The design was "stretched" in 1966 to become the one-off BT17, originally fitted with the 4.3-litre version of the Repco engine for <a href="Can-Am">Can-Am</a> racing. It was quickly abandoned by MRD after engine reliability problems became evident.

Brabham was considered a technically conservative team in the 1960s, chiefly because it persevered with traditional "<a href="spaceframe">spaceframe</a>" cars long after Lotus introduced lighter, stiffer "<a href="monocoque">monocoque</a>" chassis to Formula One in 1962. Chief designer Tauranac reasoned that monocoques of the time were not usefully stiffer than well designed spaceframe chassis, and were harder to repair and less suitable for MRD's customers. His "old fashioned" cars won the Brabham team the 1966 and 1967 championships, and were competitive in Formula One until rule changes forced a move to monocoques in 1970.

Despite the perceived conservatism, in 1963 Brabham was the first Formula One team to use a <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> to hone their designs to reduce <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly the most important factor in the design of modern cars. Towards the end of the 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic <a href="downforce">downforce</a> to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the <a href="1968%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">1968 Belgian Grand Prix</a>, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.

The team's most fertile period of technical innovation came in the 1970s and 1980s when <a href="Gordon%20Murray">Gordon Murray</a> became technical director. During 1976, the team introduced "carbon-carbon <a href="Disc%20brake">brakes</a>" to Formula One, which promised reduced "<a href="unsprung%20weight">unsprung weight</a>" and better stopping performance due to carbon's greater <a href="coefficient%20of%20friction">coefficient of friction</a>. The initial versions used <a href="reinforced%20carbon-carbon">carbon-carbon composite</a> <a href="brake%20pads">brake pads</a> and a <a href="steel">steel</a> disc faced with carbon "pucks". The technology was not reliable at first; in 1976, Carlos Pace crashed at at the <a href="%C3%96sterreichring">Österreichring</a> circuit after heat build-up in the brakes boiled the <a href="brake%20fluid">brake fluid</a>, leaving him with no way of stopping the car. By 1979, Brabham had developed an effective carbon-carbon braking system, combining structural carbon discs with carbon brake pads. By the late 1980s, carbon brakes were used by all competitors in almost all top level motor sports.

Although Brabham experimented with airdams and underbody skirts in the mid-1970s, the team, like the rest of the field, did not immediately understand Lotus's development of a <a href="ground%20effect%20in%20cars">ground effect</a> car in 1977. The <a href="Brabham%20BT46">Brabham BT46B</a> "Fan car" of 1978, generated enormous downforce with a fan, which sucked air from beneath the car, although its claimed use was for engine cooling. The car only raced once in the Formula One World Championship—<a href="Niki%20Lauda">Niki Lauda</a> winning the <a href="1978%20Swedish%20Grand%20Prix">1978 Swedish Grand Prix</a>—before a <a href="wiktionary%3Aloophole">loophole</a> in the regulations was closed by the FIA.

Although in 1979 Murray was the first to use lightweight "<a href="Carbon%20fibre%20reinforced%20plastic">carbon fibre composite</a>" panels to stiffen Brabham's <a href="aluminium">aluminium alloy</a> monocoques, he echoed his predecessor Tauranac in being the last to switch to the new fully composite monocoques. Murray was reluctant to build the entire chassis from composite materials until he understood their behaviour in a crash, an understanding achieved in part through an instrumented <a href="crash%20test">crash test</a> of a BT49 chassis. The team did not follow McLaren's 1981 MP4/1 with their own fully composite chassis until the "lowline" BT55 in 1986, the last team to do so. This technology is now used in all top level single seater racing cars.

For the 1981 season the FIA introduced a minimum <a href="ride%20height">ride height</a> for the cars, intended to slow them in corners by limiting the downforce created by aerodynamic ground effect. Gordon Murray devised a "<a href="hydropneumatic%20suspension">hydropneumatic suspension</a>" system for the BT49C, which allowed the car to settle to a much lower ride height at speed. Brabham were accused of cheating by other teams, although Murray believes that the system met the letter of the regulations. No action was taken against the team and others soon produced systems with similar effects.

At the <a href="1982%20British%20Grand%20Prix">1982 British Grand Prix</a>, Brabham reintroduced the idea of re-fuelling and changing the car's tyres during the race, unseen since the <a href="1957%20Formula%20One%20season">1957 Formula One season</a>, to allow their drivers to sprint away at the start of races on a light fuel load and soft tyres. After studying techniques used at the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a> and in <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> racing in the United States, the team were able to refuel and re-tyre the car in 14 seconds in tests ahead of the race. In 1982 Murray felt the tactic did little more than "get our sponsors noticed at races we had no chance of winning", but in 1983 the team made good use of the tactic. Refuelling was banned for 1984, and did not reappear until the <a href="1994%20Formula%20One%20season">1994 season</a> (until it was banned again in <a href="2010%20Formula%20One%20season">2010</a> as a part of cost cutting measures), but tyre changes have remained part of Formula One.

The fan car and hydropneumatic suspension exploited loopholes in the sporting regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham was accused of going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver <a href="Jacques%20Laffite">Jacques Laffite</a> was among those to claim that the cars were fitted with heavily ballasted <a href="Coachwork">bodywork</a> before being weighed at <a href="scrutineer">scrutineer</a>ing. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.

From 1978, Ecclestone was president of the <a href="Formula%20One%20Constructors%20Association">Formula One Constructors Association</a> (FOCA), a body formed by the teams to represent their interests. This left his team open to accusations of having advance warning of rule changes. Ecclestone denies that the team benefited from this and Murray has noted that, contrary to this view, at the end of 1982 the team had to abandon their new BT51 car, built on the basis that ground effect would be permitted in 1983. Brabham had to design and build a replacement, the BT52, in only three months. At the end of the 1983 season, Renault and Ferrari, both beaten to the Drivers' Championship by Piquet, protested that the <a href="Octane%20rating">Research Octane Number</a> (RON) of the team's fuel was above the legal limit of 102. The FIA declared that a figure of up to 102.9 was permitted under the rules, and that Brabham had not exceeded this limit.

Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress

The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> developed in the 1930s for the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> (USAAC). Competing against <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas</a> and <a href="Glenn%20L.%20Martin%20Company">Martin</a> for a contract to build 200 bombers, the <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> entry (prototype Model 299/XB-17) outperformed both competitors and exceeded the air corps' performance specifications. Although Boeing lost the contract (to the <a href="Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo">Douglas B-18 Bolo</a>) because the prototype crashed, the air corps ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress%20variants">design advances</a>, becoming the <a href="List%20of%20most-produced%20aircraft">third-most produced bomber</a> of all time, behind the <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24</a> and the multirole <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Ju 88</a>. 

The B-17 was primarily employed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) in the daylight <a href="Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II">strategic bombing campaign of World War II</a> against German industrial and military targets. The United States <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a>, based at many airfields in central and southern England, and the <a href="Fifteenth%20Air%20Force">Fifteenth Air Force</a>, based in Italy, complemented the <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>'s nighttime area bombing in the <a href="Combined%20Bomber%20Offensive">Combined Bomber Offensive</a> to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">the invasion of France</a> in 1944. The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">War in the Pacific</a>, early in World War II, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.

From its prewar inception, the USAAC (<a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces%23Army%20Air%20Forces%20created">by June 1941, the USAAF</a>) promoted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a relatively fast, high-flying, long-range bomber with heavy defensive armament at the expense of bombload. It developed a reputation for toughness based upon stories and photos of badly damaged B-17s safely returning to base. The B-17 developed a reputation as an effective bomber, dropping more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War II. Of the of bombs dropped on <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, 640,000 tonnes were dropped from B-17s. In addition to its role as a bomber, the B-17 was also employed as a transport, antisubmarine aircraft, drone controller, and search-and-rescue aircraft.

As of May 2015, <a href="List%20of%20surviving%20Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortresses">ten aircraft</a> remain airworthy. None of them are combat veterans. Dozens more are in storage or on static display. The oldest of these is <a href="The%20Swoose">a D-series veteran</a> of combat in the Pacific and the Caribbean.

On 8 August 1934, the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">U.S. Army Air Corps</a> (USAAC) tendered a proposal for a multi-engine bomber to replace the <a href="Martin%20B-10">Martin B-10</a>. The Air Corps was looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska. Requirements were that it would carry a "useful bombload" at an altitude of for ten hours with a top speed of at least .

They also desired, but did not require, a range of and a speed of . The competition for the air corps contract would be decided by a "fly-off" between Boeing's design, the <a href="Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo">Douglas DB-1</a>, and the <a href="Martin%20Model%20146">Martin Model 146</a> at <a href="Wright%20Field">Wright Field</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>.

The prototype B-17, with the Boeing factory designation of Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and <a href="Edward%20Curtis%20Wells">Edward Curtis Wells</a>, and was built at Boeing's own expense. It combined features of the company's experimental <a href="Boeing%20XB-15">XB-15</a> bomber and <a href="Boeing%20247">247</a> transport. The B-17's armament consisted of five .30 caliber (7.62 mm) <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, with a payload of up to of bombs on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit. The aircraft was powered by four <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20R-1690">Pratt & Whitney R-1690</a> Hornet <a href="radial%20engine">radial engine</a>s, each producing at .

The first flight of the Model 299 was on 1935 with Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower at the controls. Richard Williams, a reporter for the "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">Seattle Times</a>", coined the name "Flying Fortress" with his comment, "Why, it's a flying fortress!" when the Model 299 was rolled out bristling with multiple machine guns. The most unusual mount was in the nose, which allowed the single machine gun to be fired toward almost any frontal angle.

Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use. Boeing also claimed in some of the early press releases that Model 299 was the first combat aircraft that could continue its mission if one of its four engines failed. On , the prototype flew from Seattle to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes at an average cruising speed of , much faster than the competition.

At the fly-off, the four-engine Boeing's performance was superior to those of the twin-engine DB-1 and Model 146. <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Frank%20Maxwell%20Andrews">Frank Maxwell Andrews</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps%23GHQ%20Air%20Force">GHQ Air Force</a> believed that the long-range capabilities of four-engine large aircraft were more effective than shorter-ranged, twin-engine aircraft, and that the B-17 was better suited to new, emerging USAAC doctrine. His opinions were shared by the air corps procurement officers, and even before the competition had finished they suggested buying 65 B-17s.

Development continued on the Boeing Model 299, and on 1935, Army Air Corps test-pilot Major <a href="Ployer%20Peter%20Hill">Ployer Peter Hill</a> and Boeing employee Les Tower took the Model 299 on a second evaluation flight. The crew forgot to disengage the "<a href="gust%20lock">gust lock</a>s", a system of devices integral to the design that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the aircraft was parked on the ground. After takeoff, due to the failure to manually disengage all of the gust locks, the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over, and crashed, killing Hill and Tower (other observers survived with injuries).

The crashed Model 299 could not finish the evaluation and, while the air corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential, army officials were daunted by the much greater expense per aircraft (Douglas quoted a unit price of $58,200 based on a production order of 220 aircraft, compared with a price of $99,620 from Boeing), and as the competition could not be completed Boeing was legally disqualified from consideration for the contract. Army Chief of Staff <a href="Malin%20Craig">Malin Craig</a> cancelled the order for 65 YB-17s, and ordered 133 of the twin-engine <a href="Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo">Douglas B-18 Bolo</a> instead.
Regardless, the USAAC had been impressed by the prototype's performance, and on 1936, through a legal loophole, the air corps ordered 13 YB-17s (designated Y1B-17 after November 1936 to denote its special F-1 funding) for service testing. The YB-17 incorporated a number of significant changes from the Model 299, including more powerful <a href="Wright%20R-1820">Wright R-1820</a>-39 Cyclone engines replacing the original Pratt & Whitneys. Although the prototype was company-owned and never received a military serial (the B-17 designation itself did not appear officially until January 1936, nearly three months after the prototype crashed), the term "XB-17" was retroactively applied to the airframe and has entered the lexicon to describe the first Flying Fortress.

Between 1 March and 4 August 1937, 12 of the 13 Y1B-17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at <a href="Langley%20Field">Langley Field</a> in Virginia for operational development and flight tests. One suggestion adopted was the use of a <a href="pre-flight%20checklist">pre-flight checklist</a> to avoid accidents such as that which befell the Model 299. In one of their first missions, three B-17s, directed by lead navigator <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Curtis%20LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a>, were sent by General Andrews to <a href="Interception%20of%20the%20Rex">"intercept" and photograph the Italian ocean liner "Rex"</a> off the Atlantic coast. The mission was successful and widely publicized. The 13th Y1B-17 was delivered to the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio, to be used for flight testing.

A 14th Y1B-17 ("37-369"), originally constructed for ground testing of the airframe's strength, was upgraded and fitted with exhaust-driven General Electric turbochargers. Scheduled to fly in 1937, it encountered problems with the turbochargers, and its first flight was delayed until 1938. The aircraft was delivered to the army on 1939. Once service testing was complete, the Y1B-17s and Y1B-17A were redesignated B-17 and B-17A respectively to signify the change to operational status.

Opposition to the air corps' ambitions for the acquisition of more B-17s faded, and in late 1937, ten more aircraft designated B-17B were ordered to equip two bombardment groups, one on each U.S. coast. Improved with larger flaps, rudder and a well-framed, ten-panel <a href="Acrylic%20glass">plexiglas</a> nose, the B-17Bs were delivered in five small batches between July 1939 and March 1940. In July 1940, an order for 512 B-17s was issued; however, prior to the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, fewer than 200 B-17s were in service with the army.

A total of 155 B-17s of all variants were delivered between 1937 and 1941, but production quickly accelerated, with the B-17 once holding the record for the highest production rate for any large aircraft. The aircraft went on to serve in every <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> combat zone, and by the time production ended in May 1945, 12,731 aircraft had been built by Boeing, <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas</a> and <a href="Vega%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Vega</a> (a subsidiary of <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>).

The aircraft went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 YB-17s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia, to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio. Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a quartet of General Electric turbo-superchargers which would become standard on the B-17 line. A 14th aircraft, the YB-17A, originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbochargers, was re-designated B-17A after testing had finished.

As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the B-17B was altered to include larger <a href="rudder">rudder</a>s and <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>. The B-17C changed from three bulged, oval shaped machine gun blisters to two flush, oval-shaped machine gun window openings and a single "bathtub" machine gun <a href="Gondola%20%28airplane%29">gondola</a> housing on the lower fuselage, that resembled the similarly configured and located ventral defensive emplacement on the German <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a>P-series medium bomber. Models "A" through "D" of the B-17 were designed defensively, while the large-tailed B-17E was the first model primarily focused on offensive warfare.

The B-17E was an extensive revision of the Model 299 design: The fuselage was extended by ; a much larger rear fuselage, vertical tailfin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer were added to the design; <a href="Tail%20gunner">a gunner's position was added in the new tail</a>; the nose (especially the bombardier's well-framed, ten-panel nose glazing) remained relatively the same as the earlier "B" through "D" versions had, but with the addition of a <a href="Sperry%20Corporation">Sperry</a> electrically powered manned dorsal <a href="Aircraft%20gun%20turret">gun turret</a> just behind the cockpit, and the similarly powered (also built by Sperry) manned ventral <a href="ball%20turret">ball turret</a> just aft of the bomb bay – replacing a relatively hard-to-use, Bendix-designed remotely operated ventral turret on the earliest examples of the "E" variant, that had also been used on the earlier marks of the North American B-25 Mitchell – resulted in a 20% increase in aircraft weight. The B-17's <a href="turbocharged">turbocharged</a> <a href="Wright%20R-1820">Wright R-1820</a> Cyclone 9 engines were upgraded to increasingly more powerful versions of the same powerplants multiple times throughout its production, and similarly, the number of machine gun emplacement locations was increased to enhance their aircraft's combat effectiveness.

The B-17F variants were the primary versions flying for the Eighth Air Force to face the Germans in 1943, and had standardized the manned Sperry ball turret for ventral defense, replacing the earlier, ten-panel well-framed bombardier's nose glazing from the B subtype with an enlarged, nearly frameless plexiglas bombardier's nose enclosure for improved forward vision.

Two experimental versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations, the <a href="XB-38%20Flying%20Fortress">XB-38 Flying Fortress</a> and the <a href="YB-40%20Flying%20Fortress">YB-40 Flying Fortress</a>. The XB-38 was an engine testbed for <a href="Allison%20V-1710">Allison V-1710</a> liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The only prototype XB-38 to fly crashed on its ninth flight and the type was abandoned, the V-1710 being kept for fighters.

The YB-40 was a heavily armed modification of the standard B-17 used before the <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>, an effective long-range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included an additional dorsal turret in the radio room, a remotely operated and fired Bendix-built "chin turret" and twin guns in each of the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds. All of these modifications made the YB-40 well over heavier than a fully loaded B-17F. The YB-40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with the lighter bombers once they had dropped their bombs, and so the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943, but not before the final production blocks of the B-17F from Douglas' plants adopted the YB-40's remotely operated and fired Bendix "chin turret" for a much-improved forward defensive weapons installation.

By the time the definitive B-17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to thirteen, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were completed. The B-17G was the final version of the Flying Fortress, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B-17F, adopting the remotely operated "chin turret" for forward defense from the YB-40 "gunship" version, and in total 8,680 were built, the last one (by Lockheed) on 1945. Many B-17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing and <a href="Reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance</a>. Initially designated SB-17G, a number of B-17Gs were also converted for search-and-rescue duties, later to be redesignated B-17H.

Late in World War II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls and television cameras, loaded with of high-explosives and dubbed BQ-7 "Aphrodite missiles" for <a href="Operation%20Aphrodite">Operation Aphrodite</a>. The operation, which involved remotely flying Aphrodite drones onto their targets by accompanying CQ-17 "mothership" control aircraft, was approved on 1944, and assigned to the <a href="388th%20Bombardment%20Group">388th Bombardment Group</a> stationed at <a href="RAF%20Fersfield">RAF Fersfield</a>, a satellite of <a href="RAF%20Knettishall">RAF Knettishall</a>.

The first four drones were sent to <a href="Fortress%20of%20Mimoyecques">Mimoyecques</a>, the <a href="Siracourt%20V-1%20bunker">Siracourt V-1 bunker</a>, <a href="Blockhaus%20d%27%C3%89perlecques">Watten</a> and <a href="La%20Coupole">Wizernes</a> on 4 August, causing little damage. The project came to a sudden end with the unexplained mid-air explosion over the <a href="River%20Blyth%2C%20Suffolk">Blyth</a> estuary of a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24</a>, part of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>'s contribution as "Project Anvil", en route for <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> piloted by Lieutenant <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy%20Jr.">Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.</a>, future U.S. president <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s elder brother. Blast damage was caused over a radius of . British authorities were anxious that no similar accidents should again occur, and the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.

The B-17 began operations in <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in 1941, and in the Southwest Pacific with the U.S. Army. The 19th Bombardment Group had deployed to Clark Field in the Philippines a few weeks before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as the first of a planned heavy bomber buildup in the Pacific. Half of the group's B-17s were wiped out on 8 December 1941 when they were caught on the ground during refueling and rearming for a planned attack on Japanese airfields on Formosa. The small force of B-17s operated against the Japanese invasion force until they were withdrawn to Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory. In early 1942, the 7th Bombardment Group began arriving in Java with a mixed force of B-17s and LB-30/B-24s. A squadron of B-17 from this force detached to the Middle East to join the First Provisional Bombardment Group thus becoming the first American B-17 squadron to go to war against the Germans. After the defeat in Java, the 19th withdrew to Australia where it continued in combat until it was sent back home by General George C. Kenney when he arrived in Australia in mid-1942. In July 1942, the first USAAF B-17s were sent to England to join the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a>. Later that year two groups moved to Algeria to join Twelfth Air Force for operations in North Africa. The B-17s were primarily involved in the daylight precision <a href="strategic%20bombing">strategic bombing</a> campaign against German targets ranging from U-boat pens, docks, warehouses and airfields to industrial targets such as aircraft factories. In <a href="Operation%20Pointblank">the campaign against German aircraft forces</a> in preparation for the invasion of France, B-17 and B-24 raids were directed against German aircraft production while their presence drew the "Luftwaffe" fighters into battle with Allied fighters.

Early models proved to be unsuitable for combat use over Europe and it was the B-17E that was first successfully used by the USAAF. The defense expected from bombers operating in close formation alone did not prove effective and the bombers needed fighter escorts to operate successfully.

During World War II, the B-17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF aircraft worldwide. B-17s dropped of bombs on European targets (compared to dropped by the Liberator and dropped by all other U.S. aircraft). The British heavy bombers, the <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a>, dropped 608,612 long tons (681,645 short tons) and 224,207 long tons (251,112 short tons) respectively.

The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> entered World War II with no heavy bomber of its own in service; the biggest available were long-range medium bombers such as the <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> which could carry up to of bombs. While the <a href="Short%20Stirling">Short Stirling</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> would become its primary bombers by 1941, in early 1940 the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to be provided with 20 B-17Cs, which were given the <a href="British%20military%20aircraft%20designation%20systems">service name</a> Fortress I. Their first operation, against <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 1941 was unsuccessful; on , the target was the <a href="German%20battleship%20Scharnhorst">Scharnhorst</a>, anchored in <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>. Considerable damage was inflicted on the vessel.

By September, after the RAF had lost eight B-17Cs in combat or to accidents and many instances of aborts due to mechanical problems, <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> abandoned daylight bombing raids using the Fortress I because of the aircraft's poor performance. The experience showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B-17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bomb loads and more accurate bombing methods were required. However the USAAF continued using the B-17 as a day bomber, despite misgivings by the RAF that attempts at daylight bombing would be ineffective.

As usage by Bomber Command had been curtailed, the RAF transferred its remaining Fortress I aircraft to <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a> for use as a long-range maritime patrol aircraft instead. These were later augmented in August 1942 by 19 Fortress Mk II (B-17F) and 45 Fortress Mk IIA (B-17E). A Fortress from <a href="No.%20206%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 206 Squadron RAF</a> sank <a href="U-627">U-627</a> on 1942, the first of 11 U-boat kills credited to RAF Fortress bombers during the war.

The RAF's <a href="No.%20223%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 223 Squadron</a>, as part of <a href="No.%20100%20Group%20RAF">100 Group</a>, operated a number of Fortresses equipped with an electronic warfare system known as "Airborne Cigar" (ABC). This was operated by German-speaking radio operators who would identify and jam German ground controllers' broadcasts to their <a href="nightfighter">nightfighter</a>s. They could also pose as ground controllers themselves with the intention of steering nightfighters away from the <a href="bomber%20stream">bomber stream</a>s.

The air corps (renamed <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) on 20 June 1941), using the B-17 and other bombers, bombed from high altitudes using the then-secret <a href="Norden%20bombsight">Norden bombsight</a>, known as the "Blue Ox", which was an optical electro-mechanical gyro-stabilized <a href="analog%20computer">analog computer</a>. The device was able to determine, from variables input by the bombardier, the point at which the aircraft's bombs should be released to hit the target. The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level altitude during the final moments before release.

The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B-17Es soon after entering the war. The first <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> units arrived in <a href="High%20Wycombe%2C%20England">High Wycombe, England</a>, on 1942, to form the 97th Bomb Group. On 1942, 12 B-17Es of the 97th, with the lead aircraft piloted by Major <a href="Paul%20Tibbets">Paul Tibbets</a> and carrying <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Ira%20Eaker">Ira Eaker</a> as an observer, were close escorted by four squadrons of RAF <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire IXs</a> (and a further five squadrons of Spitfire Vs to cover the withdrawal) on the first USAAF heavy bomber raid over Europe, against the large railroad <a href="Classification%20yard">marshalling yards</a> at <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>-Sotteville in France, while a further six aircraft flew a diversionary raid along the French coast. The operation, carried out in good visibility, was a success, with only minor damage unrelated to the enemy to one aircraft and half the bombs landing in the target area. The raid helped assuage British doubts about the capabilities of American heavy bombers in operations over Europe.

Two additional groups arrived in England at the same time, bringing with them the first B-17Fs, which would serve as the primary AAF heavy bomber fighting the Germans until September 1943. As the raids of the American bombing campaign grew in numbers and frequency, German interception efforts grew in strength (such as during the attempted bombing of Kiel on 13 June 1943), such that unescorted bombing missions came to be discouraged.

The two different strategies of the American and British bomber commands were organized at the <a href="Casablanca%20Conference%20%281943%29">Casablanca Conference</a> in January 1943. The resulting "<a href="Combined%20Bomber%20Offensive">Combined Bomber Offensive</a>" would weaken the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>", destroy German morale and establish air superiority through <a href="Operation%20Pointblank">Operation Pointblank</a>'s destruction of German fighter strength in preparation for a ground offensive. The USAAF bombers would attack by day, with British operations – chiefly against industrial cities – by night.

Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General <a href="Ira%20C.%20Eaker">Ira C. Eaker</a> and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories and ball-bearing manufacturers. Attacks began in April 1943 on heavily fortified key industrial plants in <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> and <a href="Recklinghausen">Recklinghausen</a>.

Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, additional B-17 groups were formed, and Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball-bearing factories in <a href="Schweinfurt">Schweinfurt</a>, hoping to cripple the war effort there. The <a href="Schweinfurt-Regensburg%20mission">first raid</a> on 1943 did not result in critical damage to the factories, with the 230 attacking B-17s being intercepted by an estimated 300 "Luftwaffe" fighters. The Germans shot down 36 aircraft with the loss of 200 men, and coupled with a raid earlier in the day against <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>, a total of 60 B-17s were lost that day.

A second attempt on Schweinfurt on 14 October 1943 would later come to be known as "<a href="Second%20Raid%20on%20Schweinfurt">Black Thursday</a>". While the attack was successful at disrupting the entire works, severely curtailing work there for the remainder of the war, it was at an extreme cost. Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 60 were shot down over Germany, five crashed on approach to Britain, and 12 more were scrapped due to damage – a total loss of 77 B-17s. A total of 122 bombers were damaged and needed repairs before their next flight. Out of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although some survived as <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses were a result of concentrated attacks by over 300 German fighters.

Such high losses of aircrews could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers to interceptors when operating alone, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back. At the same time, the German night fighting ability noticeably improved to counter the nighttime strikes, challenging the conventional faith in the cover of darkness. The <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> alone lost 176 bombers in October 1943, and was to suffer similar casualties on 1944 on missions to <a href="Oschersleben">Oschersleben</a>, <a href="Halberstadt">Halberstadt</a> and <a href="Braunschweig">Brunswick</a>. <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">James Doolittle</a>, commander of the Eighth, had ordered the second Schweinfurt mission to be cancelled as the weather deteriorated, but the lead units had already entered hostile air space and continued with the mission. Most of the escorts turned back or missed the rendezvous, and as a result 60 B-17s were destroyed. A third raid on Schweinfurt on 1944 highlighted what came to be known as "<a href="Big%20Week">Big Week</a>", during which the bombing missions were directed against German aircraft production. German fighters would have to respond, and the <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a> and <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">Republic P-47 Thunderbolt</a> fighters (equipped with improved <a href="drop%20tank">drop tank</a>s to extend their range) accompanying the American heavies all the way to and from the targets would engage them. The escort fighters reduced the loss rate to below seven percent, with only 247 B-17s lost in 3,500 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s while taking part in the Big Week raids.

By September 1944, 27 of the 42 bomb groups of the Eighth Air Force and six of the 21 groups of the <a href="15th%20Expeditionary%20Mobility%20Task%20Force">Fifteenth Air Force</a> used B-17s. Losses to <a href="flak">flak</a> continued to take a high toll of heavy bombers through 1944 but the war in Europe was being won by the allies and by 1945 (two days after the last heavy bombing mission in Europe), the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of bombers per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.

On 7 December 1941, a group of 12 B-17s of the 38th (four B-17C) and 88th (eight B-17E) Reconnaissance Squadrons, en route to reinforce the Philippines, were flown into Pearl Harbor from <a href="Hamilton%20Field%2C%20California">Hamilton Field</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, arriving during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Leonard "Smitty" Smith Humiston, co-pilot on <a href="First%20Lieutenant">First Lieutenant</a> Robert H. Richards' B-17C, AAF S/N "40-2049", reported that he thought the U.S. Navy was giving the flight a 21-gun salute to celebrate the arrival of the bombers, after which he realized that Pearl Harbor was under attack. The Fortress came under fire from Japanese fighter aircraft, though the crew was unharmed with the exception of one member who suffered an abrasion on his hand. Enemy activity forced an abort from <a href="Hickam%20Field">Hickam Field</a> to <a href="Bellows%20Field">Bellows Field</a>, where the aircraft overran the runway and into a ditch where it was then strafed. Although initially deemed repairable, "40-2049" (11th BG / 38th RS) received more than 200 bullet holes and never flew again. Ten of the 12 Fortresses survived the attack.

By 1941, the <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28United%20States%29">Far East Air Force</a> (FEAF) based at <a href="Clark%20Air%20Base">Clark Field</a> in the Philippines had 35 B-17s, with the War Department eventually planning to raise that to 165. When the FEAF received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor, <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Lewis%20H.%20Brereton">Lewis H. Brereton</a> sent his bombers and fighters on various patrol missions to prevent them from being caught on the ground. Brereton planned B-17 raids on Japanese air fields in <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>, in accordance with <a href="Rainbow%205">Rainbow 5</a> war plan directives, but this was overruled by General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>. A series of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%281941%E2%80%9342%29%23Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20controversy">disputed discussions and decisions</a>, followed by several confusing and false reports of air attacks, delayed the authorization of the sortie. By the time the B-17s and escorting <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Warhawk</a> fighters were about to get airborne, they were destroyed by Japanese bombers of the <a href="11th%20Air%20Fleet%20%28Japan%29">11th Air Fleet</a>. The FEAF lost half its aircraft during the first strike, and was all but destroyed over the next few days.

Another early World War II Pacific engagement on 1941 involved <a href="Colin%20Kelly">Colin Kelly</a> who reportedly crashed his B-17 into the <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Haruna">Japanese battleship "Haruna"</a>, which was later acknowledged as a near bomb miss on the <a href="Japanese%20cruiser%20Ashigara">heavy cruiser "Ashigara"</a>. Nonetheless, this deed made him a celebrated <a href="war%20hero">war hero</a>. Kelly's B-17C AAF S/N "40-2045" (19th BG / 30th BS) crashed about from Clark Field after he held the burning Fortress steady long enough for the surviving crew to bail out. Kelly was posthumously awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>.
Noted Japanese ace <a href="Sabur%C5%8D%20Sakai">Saburō Sakai</a> is credited with this kill, and in the process, came to respect the ability of the Fortress to absorb punishment.

B-17s were used in early battles of the Pacific with little success, notably the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of Coral Sea</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>. While there, the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> B-17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lanes. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but it was soon discovered that only one percent of their bombs hit targets. However, B-17s were operating at heights too great for most <a href="A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a> fighters to reach, and the B-17's heavy gun armament was more than a match for lightly protected Japanese aircraft.

The B-17's greatest success in the Pacific was in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, in which they were responsible for damaging and sinking several Japanese transport ships. On 2 March 1943, six B-17s of the 64th Squadron attacked a major Japanese troop convoy from off <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, using <a href="skip%20bombing">skip bombing</a> to sink which carried 1,200 army troops, and damage two other transports, "Teiyo Maru" and "Nojima". On 3 March 1943, 13 B-17s reached the convoy and bombed from medium altitude of 7,000 feet, causing the ships to maneuver, which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti-aircraft firepower. The B-17s attracted a number of <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> fighters, which were in turn attacked by the P-38 Lightning escorts. A B-17 broke up in the air, and its crew was forced to take to their parachutes. Japanese fighter pilots machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed. Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B-17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three Lightnings, which were also lost. The Allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed, while the B-17 crews claimed five more. Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged. The remaining seven transports and three of the eight destroyers were then sunk by a combination of low level strafing runs by <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Beaufighters</a>, and skip bombing by USAAF <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">North American B-25 Mitchell</a>s at , while B-17s claimed five hits from higher altitudes. On the morning of 4 March 1943, a B-17 sank the destroyer "Asashio" with a bomb while she was picking up survivors from "Arashio".

A peak of 168 B-17 bombers were in the Pacific theater in September 1942, with all groups converting to other types by mid-1943. In mid-1942, Gen. Arnold decided that the B-17 was inadequate for the kind of operations required in the Pacific and made plans to replace all of the B-17s in the theater with B-24s (and later, B-29s) as soon as they became available. Although the conversion was not complete until mid-1943, B-17 combat operations in the Pacific theater came to an end after a little over a year. Surviving aircraft were reassigned to the 54th Troop Carrier Wing's special airdrop section, and were used to drop supplies to ground forces operating in close contact with the enemy. Special airdrop B-17s supported Australian commandos operating near the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, which had been the primary B-17 target in 1942 and early 1943.

B-17s were still used in the Pacific later in the war, however. The main task that they were used for was the <a href="combat%20search%20and%20rescue">combat search and rescue</a> role. A number of B-17Gs, redesignated B-17Hs and later SB-17Gs, were used in the Pacific during the final year of the war to carry and drop lifeboats to stranded bomber crews who had been shot down or crashed at sea. These aircraft were nicknamed <a href="Dumbo%20%28air-sea%20rescue%29">Dumbos</a>, and remained in service for many years after the end of World War II.

Before the advent of long-range <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> escorts, B-17s had only their <a href=".50%20BMG">.50 caliber</a> <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M2 Browning machine gun</a>s to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor. The number of defensive guns increased from four machine guns and one nose machine gun in the B-17C, to thirteen machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not <a href="air%20combat%20manoeuvring">maneuver</a> when attacked by fighters, and needed to be flown straight and level during their final bomb run, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.

A 1943 survey by the <a href="USAAF">USAAF</a> found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans had left the protection of the main formation. To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered <a href="combat%20box">combat box</a> formation where all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns, making a formation of the bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters. "Luftwaffe" fighter pilots likened attacking a B-17 combat box formation to encountering a "fliegendes Stachelschwein", "flying porcupine", with dozens of machine guns on a combat box formation of bombers, aimed at them from almost every direction. However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual aircraft could not engage in evasive maneuvers: they had to fly constantly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to the German <a href="flak">flak</a>. Moreover, German fighter aircraft later used the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict damage with minimum risk.

As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions (60 of 291 B-17s were lost in combat on the second <a href="Raid%20on%20Schweinfurt">Raid on Schweinfurt</a>), and it was not until the advent of long-range fighter escorts (particularly the <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>) resulting in the degradation of the "Luftwaffe" as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944, that the B-17 became strategically potent.
The B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B-17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War II, said, "The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home." <a href="Martin%20Caidin">Martin Caidin</a> reported one instance in which a B-17 suffered a midair collision with a <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Focke-Wulf Fw 190</a>, losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, and being knocked out of formation by the impact. The B-17 was reported as shot down by observers, but it survived and brought its crew home without injury. Its toughness was compensation for its shorter range and lighter bomb load compared to the B-24 and British <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers. Stories circulated B-17s returning to base with tails shredded, engines destroyed and large portions of their wings destroyed by <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">flak</a>. This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a> and the fame achieved by the "<a href="Memphis%20Belle%20%28B-17%29">Memphis Belle</a>", made the B-17 a key bomber aircraft of the war. Other factors such as combat effectiveness and political issues also contributed to the B-17's success.

The B-17 design went through eight major changes over the course of its production, culminating in the B-17G, differing from its immediate predecessor by the addition of a bombardier-operated, remotely controlled chin <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> with two caliber <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">M2 Browning machine gun</a>s under the nose, also fitted to the final eighty-six production aircraft of the B-17F-DLs built by Douglas, after being first tried in May 1943 as part of the increased armament system of the YB-40. This eliminated the B-17's main defensive weakness in head-on attacks.

After examining wrecked B-17s and B-24s, Luftwaffe officers discovered that on average it took about 20 hits with <a href="MG%20151%20cannon">20 mm</a> shells fired from the rear to bring them down. Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to fire one thousand rounds at a bomber. Early versions of the <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Fw 190</a>, one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two <a href="MG%20FF%20cannon">MG FF</a> cannons, which carried only 500 rounds when belt-fed (normally using 60-round <a href="drum%20magazine">drum magazine</a>s in earlier installations), and later with the better <a href="MG%20151%20cannon">Mauser MG 151/20</a> cannons, which had a longer effective range than the MG FF weapon. Later versions carried four or even six MG 151/20 cannon and twin <a href="MG%20131%20machine%20gun">13 mm machine guns</a>. The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were mounted (and where the pilot was exposed and not protected by armor as he was from the rear), it took only four or five hits to bring a bomber down. To rectify the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, creating <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190%20operational%20history%23The%20Sturmb%C3%B6cke">the "Sturmbock"</a> bomber destroyer version. This type replaced the vulnerable twin-engine "Zerstörer" heavy fighters which could not survive interception by P-51 Mustangs flying well ahead of the combat boxes in an <a href="air%20supremacy">air supremacy</a> role starting very early in 1944 – <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle%23Doolittle%27s%20breakthrough%20in%20fighter%20tactics">as ordered</a> by the Eighth Air Force's commander, then-Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle – to clear any Luftwaffe defensive fighters from the skies. By 1944, a further upgrade to <a href="Rheinmetall">Rheinmetall</a>-<a href="Borsig">Borsig</a>'s <a href="MK%20108%20cannon">MK 108 cannon</a>s mounted either in the wing, or in underwing, conformal mount gun pods, was made for the "Sturmbock" Focke-Wulfs as either the <a href="R%C3%BCstsatz">/R2 or /R8 field modification kits</a>, enabling aircraft to bring a bomber down with just a few hits.
The adoption of the <a href="21%20cm%20Nebelwerfer%2042">21 cm Nebelwerfer</a>-derived "<a href="Werfer-Granate%2021">Werfer-Granate 21</a>" (Wfr. Gr. 21) rocket mortar by the Luftwaffe in mid-August 1943 promised the introduction of a major "stand-off" style of offensive weapon – one strut-mounted tubular launcher was fixed under each wing panel on the Luftwaffe's single-engine fighters, and two under each wing panel of a few twin-engine <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Bf 110</a> daylight "Zerstörer" aircraft. However, due to the slow 715 mph velocity and characteristic <a href="Bullet%20drop">ballistic drop</a> of the fired rocket (despite the usual mounting of the launcher at about 15° upward orientation), and the small number of fighters fitted with the weapons, the Wfr. Gr. 21 never had a major effect on the combat box formations of Fortresses. The Luftwaffe also fitted heavy-calibre "Bordkanone"-series 37, 50 and even cannon as anti-bomber weapons on twin-engine aircraft such as the special <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Ju 88P</a> fighters, as well as one model of the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20410">Me 410</a> "Hornisse" but these measures did not have much effect on the American strategic bomber offensive. The <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20262">Me 262</a>, however, had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war. With its usual nose-mounted armament of four <a href="MK%20108%20cannon">MK 108 cannon</a>s, and with some examples later equipped with the <a href="R4M%20rocket">R4M rocket</a>, launched from underwing racks, it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' defensive guns and bring an aircraft down with one hit, as both the MK 108's shells and the R4M's warheads were filled with the "shattering" force of the strongly <a href="Brisance">brisant</a> <a href="RDX">Hexogen</a> military explosive.

During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were captured and refurbished, with about a dozen put back into the air. Given German "<a href="Balkenkreuz">Balkenkreuz</a>" national markings on their wings and fuselage sides, and "<a href="Nazi%20swastika">"Hakenkreuz" swastika</a>" tail fin-flashes, the captured B-17s were used to determine the B-17's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in attack tactics. Others, with the cover designations Dornier Do 200 and Do 288, were used as long-range transports by the <a href="Kampfgeschwader%20200">"Kampfgeschwader" 200</a> special duties unit, carrying out agent drops and supplying secret airstrips in the Middle East and North Africa. They were chosen specifically for these missions as being more suitable for this role than other available German aircraft; they never attempted to deceive the Allies and always wore full "Luftwaffe" markings. One B-17 of KG200, bearing the "Luftwaffe's" KG 200 "Geschwaderkennung" (combat wing code) markings "A3+FB", was interned by Spain when it landed at <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> airfield, 1944, remaining there for the rest of the war. It has been alleged that some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used by the "Luftwaffe" in attempts to infiltrate B-17 bombing formations and report on their positions and altitudes. According to these allegations, the practice was initially successful, but Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any "stranger" trying to join a group's formation.

The U.S. did not offer B-17s to the Soviet Union as part of its war materiel assistance program, but at least 73 aircraft were acquired by the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a>. These aircraft had landed with mechanical trouble during the <a href="Operation%20Frantic">shuttle bombing raids</a> over Germany or had been damaged by a "Luftwaffe" raid in <a href="Poltava">Poltava</a>. The Soviets restored 23 to flying condition and concentrated them in the 890th bomber regiment of the 45th bomber division, but they never saw combat. In 1946 the regiment was assigned to the <a href="Kazan">Kazan</a> factory to aid in the Soviet effort to reproduce the more advanced <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29</a> as the <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-4">Tupolev Tu-4</a>.

During the war, the <a href="Strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20II">Allied bomber offensive</a> sometimes took U.S. or British bombers into Swiss airspace, either damaged craft seeking safety or on rare occasions <a href="Bombings%20of%20Switzerland%20in%20World%20War%20II">bombing Swiss cities</a> by accident. Swiss aircraft would attempt to intercept and force individual aircraft to land, interning their crews; one Swiss pilot was killed, shot down by a U.S. bomber crew in September 1944. From then on, red and white neutrality bands were added to the wings of Swiss aircraft to stop accidental attacks by Allied aircraft.

Official Swiss records identify 6,501 airspace violations during the course of the war, with 198 foreign aircraft landing on Swiss territory and 56 aircraft crashing there. In October 1943 the Swiss <a href="interned">interned</a> Boeing B-17F-25-VE, tail number 25841, and her U.S. flight crew after the Flying Fortress developed engine trouble and was forced to land following its bombing raid over Germany. The aircraft was then turned over to the <a href="Swiss%20Air%20Force">Swiss Air Force</a>, who then flew the bomber until the end of the war, using other interned but non-flyable B-17s for spare parts. The bomber was repainted a dark <a href="olive%20drab">olive drab</a>, but retained its light gray-painted under surfaces. It carried Swiss national white cross insignia in red squares on both sides of its rudder, fuselage sides, and the underside wings, with white crosses in red <a href="roundel">roundel</a>s atop both upper wings. As on its gray under surfaces, the B-17F also carried light gray flash letters "RD" and "I" on either side of the Swiss national insignia.

Three damaged B-17s, one "D" model and two "E" models, were rebuilt to flying status by Japanese technicians and mechanics; the parts used were stripped from captured B-17 wrecks in both the Philippines and the Netherlands East Indies. The three bombers, containing captured top secret <a href="Norden%20Bombsight">Norden Bombsight</a>s, were then flown to Japan where they underwent extensive technical evaluation by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Force">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a>'s Air Technical Research Laboratory (Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo). The "D" model was later deemed an obsolescent design. The two "E" models were used to develop B-17 air combat counter-tactics; they were also used as enemy aircraft in several Japanese propaganda films. One of the captured "E" Flying Fortresses was photographed and code named "Tachikawa 105" after its wing span was measured; U. S. aerial photo recon analysts never identified it as a captured B-17 until after the war. No traces of these captured Flying Fortresses were found in Japan by <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> occupation forces; they were assumed scrapped late in the war for their vital war materials.

Following the end of World War II, the B-17 was quickly phased out of use as a bomber and the Army Air Forces retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States where the majority were sold for scrap and melted down, although significant numbers remained in use in second-line roles such as VIP transports, air-sea rescue and photo-reconnaissance. <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a> (SAC), established in 1946, used reconnaissance B-17s (at first called F-9 ["F" for "Fotorecon"], later RB-17) until 1949. With the disestablishment of the U.S. Army Air Forces and the establishment of an independent <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> in 1947, most extant B-17s were transferred to USAF.

The USAF <a href="Air%20Rescue%20Service">Air Rescue Service</a> of the <a href="Military%20Air%20Transport%20Service">Military Air Transport Service</a> (MATS) operated B-17s as so-called <a href="Dumbo%20%28air-sea%20rescue%29">"Dumbo"</a> <a href="air-sea%20rescue">air-sea rescue</a> aircraft. Work on using B-17s to carry <a href="airborne%20lifeboat">airborne lifeboat</a>s had begun in 1943, but they entered service in the European theater only in February 1945, also being used to provide search and rescue support for <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29</a> raids against Japan. About 130 B-17s were converted to the air-sea rescue role, at first designated B-17H and later SB-17G. Some SB-17s had their defensive guns removed, while others retained their guns to allow use close to combat areas. The SB-17 served through the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, remaining in service with USAF until the mid-1950s.

In 1946, surplus B-17s were chosen as <a href="Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">drone aircraft</a> for atmospheric sampling during the <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> atomic bomb tests, being able to fly close to or even through the <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a>s without endangering a crew. This led to more widespread conversion of B-17s as drones and drone control aircraft, both for further use in atomic testing and as targets for testing <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air</a> and <a href="air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air missile</a>s. were converted to drones. The last operational mission flown by a USAF Fortress was conducted on 1959, when a DB-17P, serial " 44-83684 ", directed a QB-17G, out of <a href="Holloman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Holloman Air Force Base</a>, New Mexico, as a target for an <a href="AIM-4%20Falcon">AIM-4 Falcon</a> air-to-air missile fired from a <a href="McDonnell%20F-101%20Voodoo">McDonnell F-101 Voodoo</a>. A retirement ceremony was held several days later at Holloman AFB, after which "44-83684" was retired. It was subsequently used in various films and in the 1960s television show "12 O'Clock High" before being retired to the <a href="Planes%20of%20Fame">Planes of Fame</a> aviation museum in Chino, California. Perhaps the most famous B-17, the "<a href="Memphis%20Belle%20%28aircraft%29">Memphis Belle</a>", is currently being restored – simultaneously with the B-17D "The Swoose" – to its World War II wartime appearance by the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a>, Ohio.

During the last year of World War II and shortly thereafter, the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> acquired 48 ex-USAAF B-17s for patrol and air-sea rescue work. The first two ex-USAAF B-17s, a B-17F (later modified to B-17G standard) and a B-17G were obtained by the Navy for various development programs. At first, these aircraft operated under their original USAAF designations, but on 31 July 1945 they were assigned the naval aircraft designation PB-1, a designation which had originally been used in 1925 for the <a href="Boeing%20Model%2050">Boeing Model 50</a> experimental flying boat.

Thirty-two B-17Gs were used by the Navy under the designation PB-1W, the suffix -W indicating an airborne early warning role. A large radome for an <a href="S-band">S-band</a> <a href="List%20of%20radars">AN/APS-20</a> search radar was fitted underneath the fuselage and additional internal fuel tanks were added for longer range, with the provision for additional underwing fuel tanks. Originally, the B-17 was also chosen because of its heavy defensive armament, but this was later deleted. These aircraft were painted dark blue, a standard Navy paint scheme which had been adopted in late 1944. The PB-1W eventually evolved into an early warning aircraft by virtue of its APS-20 search radar. PB-1Ws continued in USN service until 1955, gradually being phased out in favor of the Lockheed WV-2 (known in the USAF as the <a href="EC-121">EC-121</a>, a designation adopted by USN in 1962), a military version of the <a href="Lockheed%20Constellation">Lockheed 1049 Constellation</a> commercial airliner.

In July 1945, 16 B-17s were transferred to the Coast Guard via the Navy; these aircraft were initially assigned U.S. Navy Bureau Numbers (BuNo), but were delivered to the Coast Guard designated as PB-1Gs beginning in July 1946. Coast Guard PB-1Gs were stationed at a number of bases in the U.S. and Newfoundland, with five at <a href="Coast%20Guard%20Air%20Station%20Elizabeth%20City">Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City</a>, North Carolina, two at <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Airport">CGAS San Francisco</a>, two at <a href="NAS%20Argentia">NAS Argentia</a>, Newfoundland, one at <a href="CGAS%20Kodiak">CGAS Kodiak</a>, Alaska, and one in Washington state. They were used primarily for air-sea rescue, but were also used for iceberg patrol duties and for photo mapping. Air-sea rescue PB-1Gs, often nicknamed as <a href="Dumbo%20%28air-sea%20rescue%29">"Dumbo"</a> patrol aircraft, usually carried a droppable lifeboat underneath the fuselage and the chin turret was often replaced by a radome. The Coast Guard PB-1Gs served throughout the 1950s, the last example not being withdrawn from service until 14 October 1959.

B-17s were used by the CIA front companies Civil Air Transport, Air America and Intermountain Aviation for special missions. These included B-17G "44-85531", registered as N809Z. These aircraft were primarily used for agent drop missions over the People's Republic of China, flying from Taiwan, with Taiwanese crews. Four B-17s were shot down in these operations.

In 1957 the surviving B-17s had been stripped of all weapons and painted black. One of these Taiwan-based B-17s was flown to <a href="Clark%20Air%20Base">Clark Air Base</a> in the Philippines in mid-September, assigned for covert missions into Tibet.

On 28 May 1962, N809Z, piloted by Connie Seigrist and Douglas Price, flew Major James Smith, USAF and Lieutenant Leonard A. LeSchack, USNR to the abandoned Soviet arctic ice station NP 8, as <a href="Operation%20Coldfeet">Operation Coldfeet</a>. Smith and LeSchack parachuted from the B-17 and searched the station for several days. On 1 June, Seigrist and Price returned and picked up Smith and LeSchack using a <a href="Fulton%20Skyhook">Fulton Skyhook</a> system installed on the B-17. N809Z was used to perform a Skyhook pick up in the James Bond movie "<a href="Thunderball%20%28film%29">Thunderball</a>" in 1965. This aircraft, now restored to its original B-17G configuration, is on display in the <a href="Evergreen%20Aviation%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Museum">Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum</a> in <a href="McMinnville%2C%20Oregon">McMinnville, Oregon</a>.

The B-17 was a versatile aircraft, serving in dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat throughout World War II, and in other roles for the RAF. Its main use was in <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Europe</a>, where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper it as much as in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater</a>. Peak USAAF inventory (in August 1944) was 4,574 worldwide.

The B-17 Flying Fortress became symbolic in the United States of that country's air power. In a 1943 <a href="Consolidated%20Aircraft">Consolidated Aircraft</a> poll of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated adverts had been run in newspapers, 73% had heard of the B-24 and 90% knew of the B-17.

After the first B-17s were delivered to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they were used on promotional flights promoting their long range and navigational capabilities. In January 1938, group commander <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Robert%20Olds">Robert Olds</a> flew a YB-17 from the United States's east coast to its west coast, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours 27 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging in 11 hours 1 minute. Six bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group took off from <a href="Langley%20Field">Langley Field</a> on 1938 as part of a goodwill flight to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires, Argentina</a>. Covering they returned on , with seven aircraft setting off on a flight to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil, three days later. In a well-publicized mission on 12 May of the same year, three B-17s "intercepted" and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner <a href="SS%20Rex">SS "Rex"</a> off the Atlantic coast.

Many pilots who flew both preferred the B-17 over the B-24 for its greater stability and ease in formation flying. Its electrical systems were less vulnerable to damage than the B-24's hydraulics, and the B-17 flew better than the B-24 when missing an engine. During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the <a href="Eighth%20Air%20Force">Eighth Air Force</a>, had an open preference for the B-17. <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">Jimmy Doolittle</a> wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s, citing the logistical advantage in keeping field forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their individual servicing and spares. For this reason, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24. Making it back to base on numerous occasions despite extensive battle damage, its durability became mythical; stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage were widely circulated during the war. Despite an inferior performance and smaller bombload than the more numerous B-24, a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.



Many B-17 crew members received military honors and 17 received the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States:


<a href="Classical%20Hollywood%20cinema">Hollywood</a> featured the B-17 in its period films, such as director <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>' "<a href="Air%20Force%20%28film%29">Air Force</a>" starring <a href="John%20Garfield">John Garfield</a> and "<a href="Twelve%20O%27Clock%20High">Twelve O'Clock High</a>" starring <a href="Gregory%20Peck">Gregory Peck</a>. Both films were made with the full cooperation of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> and used USAAF aircraft and (for "Twelve O'Clock High") combat footage. In 1964, the latter film was made into a <a href="Twelve%20O%27Clock%20High%20%28TV%20series%29">television show of the same name</a> and ran for three years on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC TV</a>. Footage from "Twelve O' Clock High" was also used, along with three restored B-17s, in the 1962 film "<a href="The%20War%20Lover">The War Lover</a>". The B-17 also appeared in the 1938 movie "<a href="Test%20Pilot%20%28film%29">Test Pilot</a>" with <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a> and <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, with Clark Gable in "<a href="Command%20Decision%20%28film%29">Command Decision</a>" in 1948, in "<a href="Tora%21%20Tora%21%20Tora%21">Tora!

The most famous B-17, the "<a href="Memphis%20Belle%20%28B-17%29">Memphis Belle</a>", toured the U. S. with its crew to reinforce national morale (and to sell <a href="war%20bond">war bond</a>s). It starred in a USAAF documentary, "".

B-17's are seen flying (and crashing in flames) in the British film <a href="The%20Way%20to%20the%20Stars">The Way to the Stars</a>.

The song, "Icarus II (Borne On Wings Of Steel)" by <a href="Kansas%20%28band%29">Kansas</a>, from the album <a href="Somewhere%20to%20Elsewhere">Somewhere to Elsewhere</a>, has lyrics sung by <a href="Steve%20Walsh%20%28musician%29">Steve Walsh</a> that describe the heroic sacrifice a B-17 pilot makes to save his crew after they are hit and going down, ordering them to jump, leaving him to steer the dying plane to its end.

The B-17 has also been featured in artistic works expressing the physical and psychological stress of the combat conditions and the high casualty rates that crews suffered. Works such as <a href="The%20Death%20of%20the%20Ball%20Turret%20Gunner">The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner</a> by <a href="Randall%20Jarrell">Randall Jarrell</a> and <a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28film%29">Heavy Metal (film)</a>'s section "B-17" depict the nature of these missions. The <a href="Ball%20turret">Ball turret</a> itself has inspired works like <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s "<a href="Amazing%20Stories%20%28TV%20series%29">The Mission</a>". Artists who served on the bomber units also created paintings and drawings depicting the combat conditions in World War II.

Bathyscaphe Trieste

Trieste is a <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a>-designed, <a href="Italy">Italian</a>-built deep-diving research <a href="bathyscaphe">bathyscaphe</a>, which with its crew of two reached a record maximum depth of about , in the deepest known part of the <a href="Earth%27s%20oceans">Earth's oceans</a>, the <a href="Challenger%20Deep">Challenger Deep</a>, in the <a href="Mariana%20Trench">Mariana Trench</a> near <a href="Guam">Guam</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. On 23 January 1960, <a href="Jacques%20Piccard">Jacques Piccard</a> (son of the boat's designer <a href="Auguste%20Piccard">Auguste Piccard</a>) and US Navy Lieutenant <a href="Don%20Walsh">Don Walsh</a> achieved the goal of <a href="Project%20Nekton">Project Nekton</a>.

"Trieste" was the first manned vessel to have reached the bottom of the Challenger Deep.

"Trieste" consisted of a float chamber filled with <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> (petrol) for <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a>, with a separate pressure sphere to hold the crew. This configuration (dubbed a "<a href="bathyscaphe">bathyscaphe</a>" by the Piccards), allowed for a free dive, rather than the previous <a href="bathysphere">bathysphere</a> designs in which a sphere was lowered to depth and raised again to the surface by a cable attached to a ship.

"Trieste" was designed by the Swiss scientist Auguste Piccard and originally built in Italy. His pressure sphere, composed of two sections, was built by the company Acciaierie <a href="Terni">Terni</a>. The upper part was manufactured by the company <a href="Cantieri%20Riuniti%20dell%27Adriatico">Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico</a>, in the <a href="Free%20Territory%20of%20Trieste">Free Territory of Trieste</a> (on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia); hence the name chosen for the bathyscaphe. The installation of the pressure sphere was done in the Cantiere navale di <a href="Castellammare%20di%20Stabia">Castellammare di Stabia</a>, near <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. "Trieste" was launched on 26 August 1953 into the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> near the <a href="Capri">Isle of Capri</a>. The design was based on previous experience with the bathyscaphe "<a href="FNRS-2">FNRS-2</a>". "Trieste" was operated by the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>. After several years of operation in the Mediterranean Sea, the "Trieste" was purchased by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in 1958 for $250,000.

At the time of <a href="Project%20Nekton">Project Nekton</a>, "Trieste" was more than 15 m (50 ft) long. The majority of this was a series of floats filled with of gasoline, and water ballast tanks were included at either end of the vessel, as well as releasable iron ballast in two conical hoppers along the bottom, fore and aft of the crew sphere. The crew occupied the 2.16 m (7.09 ft) pressure sphere, attached to the underside of the float and accessed from the deck of the vessel by a vertical shaft that penetrated the float and continued down to the sphere hatch.

The pressure sphere provided just enough room for two people. It provided completely independent life support, with a closed-circuit <a href="rebreather">rebreather</a> system similar to that used in modern spacecraft and spacesuits: oxygen was provided from pressure cylinders, and carbon dioxide was scrubbed from breathing air by being passed through canisters of <a href="Soda%20lime">soda-lime</a>. Power was provided by batteries.

"Trieste" was subsequently fitted with a new pressure sphere, manufactured by the <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> Steel Works of <a href="Essen%2C%20Germany">Essen, Germany</a>, in three finely-machined sections (an equatorial ring and two caps).

To withstand the enormous pressure of 1.25 <a href="tonne">metric tons</a> per cm² (110 <a href="MPa">MPa</a>) at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the sphere's walls were thick (it was <a href="Factor%20of%20safety">overdesigned</a> to withstand considerably more than the rated pressure). The sphere weighed in air and in water (giving it an average specific gravity of 13/(13-8) = 2.6 times that of sea water). The float was necessary because of the sphere's density: it was not possible to design a sphere large enough to hold a person that could withstand the necessary pressures, yet also have metal walls thin enough for the sphere to be neutrally buoyant. Gasoline was chosen as the float fluid because it is less dense than water and incompressible even at extreme pressure, thus retaining its buoyant properties and negating the need for thick, heavy walls for the float chamber.

Observation of the sea outside the craft was conducted directly by eye, via a single, very tapered, cone-shaped block of <a href="acrylic%20glass">acrylic glass</a> (Plexiglas), the only transparent substance identified which would withstand the external pressure. Outside illumination for the craft was provided by quartz <a href="arc%20lamp">arc-light</a> bulbs, which proved to be able to withstand the over (100 MPa) of pressure without any modification.

Transported to the <a href="Naval%20Electronics%20Laboratory">Naval Electronics Laboratory</a>'s facility in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>, "Trieste" was modified extensively by the Americans, and then used in a series of deep-submergence tests in the Pacific Ocean during the next few years, culminating in the dive to the bottom of the Challenger Deep during January 1960.

"Trieste" departed San Diego on 5 October 1959 for Guam aboard the freighter "Santa Maria" to participate in "Project Nekton", a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench.

On 23 January 1960; she reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh. This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest known point of the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of , although this was revised later to ; fairly recently, more accurate measurements have found Challenger Deep to be between and deep.

The descent to the ocean floor took 4 hours 47 minutes at a descent rate of . After passing , one of the outer Plexiglas window panes cracked, shaking the entire vessel. The two men spent barely twenty minutes on the ocean floor. The temperature in the cabin was 7 °C (45 °F) at the time. While at maximum depth, Piccard and Walsh unexpectedly regained the ability to communicate with the support ship, <a href="USS%20Wandank%20%28ATA-204%29%23Mariana%20Islands%20service.2C%201955-1967">USS "Wandank" (ATA-204)</a>, using a <a href="sonar">sonar</a>/<a href="hydrophone">hydrophone</a> voice communications system. At a speed of almost – about five times the speed of sound in air – it took about seven seconds for a voice message to travel from the craft to the support ship and another seven seconds for answers to return.

While at the bottom, Piccard and Walsh observed a number of small <a href="sole%20%28fish%29">sole</a> and <a href="flounder">flounder</a>. Their claim the fish were swimming would prove at least some vertebrate life can withstand the extreme pressure at the oceans' deepest point. They noted that the floor of the Challenger Deep consisted of "<a href="diatom">diatom</a>aceous ooze". The ascent took 3 hours and 15 minutes.
Beginning in April 1963, "Trieste" was modified and used in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to search for the missing nuclear submarine . "Trieste" was delivered to Boston Harbor by USS "Point Defiance" (LSD-31) under the command of Captain H. H. Haisten. In August 1963, "Trieste" found the wreck off the coast of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, below the surface. "Trieste" was changed, improved and redesigned so many times that almost no original parts remain. She was transported to the Washington Navy Yard where she was exhibited along with the Krupp pressure sphere in the <a href="U.S.%20Navy%20Museum">National Museum of the U.S. Navy</a> at the <a href="Washington%20Navy%20Yard">Washington Navy Yard</a> in 1980. Her original Terni pressure sphere was incorporated into the "<a href="Bathyscaphe%20Trieste%20II">Trieste II</a>".

The song "The Trench" by Danish composer <a href="Ste%20van%20Holm">Ste van Holm</a> is a tribute to the Mariana Trench dives.

"Voyage Of The Trieste" - an instrumental track on <a href="The%20Chocolate%20Watchband">The Chocolate Watchband</a>'s 1968 LP "<a href="The%20Inner%20Mystique">The Inner Mystique</a>".

The producers of the TV show "" named one of the show's <a href="starship">starship</a>s U.S.S. "Trieste", after the bathyscaphe.

"Trieste" appears in the 2008 novel "<a href="Flood%20%28Baxter%20novel%29">Flood</a>" by <a href="Stephen%20Baxter%20%28author%29">Stephen Baxter</a>.

Battle of Bouvines

The Battle of Bouvines, which took place on 27 July 1214, was a medieval battle which ended the <a href="Anglo-French%20War%20%281202%E2%80%9314%29">1202–1214 Anglo-French War</a>. It was fundamental in the early development of <a href="France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">France in the Middle Ages</a> by confirming the French crown's <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> over the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin lands</a> of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a>.

<a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip Augustus</a> of France defeated an army consisting of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Imperial German</a>, English and Flemish soldiers, led by <a href="Otto%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor</a> in the north. Allied with Philip was <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a> <a href="House%20of%20Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</a>, who controlled the southern Holy Roman Empire and afterwards deposed Otto. Other leaders included Count <a href="Ferdinand%2C%20Prince%20of%20Portugal">Ferrand of Flanders</a>, <a href="William%20de%20Longespee%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William de Longespee</a> and <a href="Renaud%20de%20Dammartin">Renaud of Boulogne</a>. Ferrand and Renaud were captured and imprisoned and <a href="John%20of%20England">King John of England</a> was forced to agree to the <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a> by his discontented barons. Philip was himself able to take undisputed control of most of the territories in France that had belonged to <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John of England</a>, Otto's maternal uncle and ally.

In 1214, <a href="Ferdinand%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Ferdinand, Infante of Portugal, and Count of Flanders</a> desired the return of the cities of Aire-sur-la-Lys and Saint-Omer, which he had recently lost to <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II, King of France</a> in the Treaty of Pont-à-Vendin. He thus broke allegiance with Philip and assembled a broad coalition including <a href="Otto%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Otto IV</a>, <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John I of England</a>, <a href="Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brabant">Duke Henry I of Brabant</a>, <a href="William%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Holland">Count William I of Holland</a>, <a href="Theobald%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lorraine">Duke Theobald I of Lorraine</a>, and <a href="Henry%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Limburg">Duke Henry III of Limburg</a>.

The campaign was planned by John, who was the fulcrum of the alliance; his plan was to draw the French away from Paris southward towards his forces and keep them occupied, while the main army, under Emperor Otto IV, marched on Paris from the north. John's plan was carried out at first, but the allies in the north moved slowly. John, after two encounters with the French, retreated to <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> on 3 July.

On 23 July, after having summoned all his <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s, Philip had an army consisting of 4,000 cavalry and 11,000 foot soldiers. The emperor finally succeeded in concentrating his forces at <a href="Valenciennes">Valenciennes</a>, although John was out of the picture, and in the interval Philip Augustus had counter marched northward and regrouped. Philip now took the offensive himself, and in maneuvering to get a good cavalry ground upon which to fight he offered battle (27 July), on the plain east of Bouvines and the river Marque. Otto was surprised by the speed of his enemy and was thought to have been caught unprepared by the King of France (who probably attracted the emperor into this trap). Although he was under a Church <a href="interdict">interdict</a>, Otto, already an excommunicate, decided to launch an attack on what was then the French rearguard. Philippe Auguste gave battle. His army quickly retreated.

The Allied army drew up facing south-westward towards Bouvines, the heavy cavalry on the wings, the infantry in one great mass in the center, supported by the cavalry corps under the emperor himself. The French army took ground exactly opposite in a similar formation, cavalry on the wings, infantry, including the town militias in the centre, Philip with the cavalry reserve and the royal standard, the <a href="Oriflamme">Oriflamme</a>, in rear of the men on foot. Philip's army contained about 2,000 knights (750 were from the <a href="Crown%20lands%20of%20France">royal demesne</a>) and 2,000 mounted <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>s with the rest being infantry.

Even today, the evaluation of forces is controversial. The classic French historiography often refers to Coalition troops three times more numerous than those of the King of France. <a href="Philippe%20Contamine">Philippe Contamine</a> is not of this opinion: "On the face of it, his opponents did not have a clear numerical superiority". It is said by <a href="William%20the%20Breton">William the Breton</a>, chaplain to Philip at the Battle of Bouvines, that the lines of soldiers stood in line in a space of 40,000 steps (), which leaves very little clearance and predisposes to hand-to-hand fighting (<a href="melee">melee</a>). William the Breton also says in his column that "the two lines of combatants were separated by a pretty small space".

Philip Augustus had then launched an appeal to the municipalities in northern France, in order to obtain their support.

Seventeen of the thirty-nine municipalities of the <a href="Crown%20lands%20of%20France">royal demesne</a> answered the call for <a href="militia">militia</a>:

In total, the royal army totalled 7,000 soldiers.

The royal army was divided into three parts:

The bridge of Bouvines, the only means of retreat across the marshes, was guarded by 150 sergeants at arms of the king who formed the only reserve for the French.

Otto also divided his army into three groups:

At the extreme right, the English archers supported the flank of both the Brabant infantry and the nobles of the two Lorraines.

The battle opened with a simultaneous cavalry charge between the French right and the Flemish left. The French quickly routed the Flemings, who retreated. The serious fighting was between the two centers. The infantry of the Low Countries, who were at this time among the best in Europe, drove back the French. Philip led the cavalry reserve of nobles and knights to retrieve the day, and after a long and doubtful fight (in which he himself was unhorsed and narrowly escaped death), began to drive back the Flemings.

Meanwhile, on the French left Robert de Dreux's troops are at first pressed by men led by William Longespée and Renaud de Dammartin are forced to defend the Bouvines bridge foot by foot. William Longespée was unhorsed and taken prisoner by <a href="Philip%20of%20Dreux">Philip of Dreux</a>, (a.k.a. the fighting <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Beauvais">Bishop of Beauvais</a>) and the English soldiers fled. <a href="Matthieu%20II%20of%20Montmorency">Mathieu de Montmorency</a> captured twelve enemy banners (in memory of this feat, the shield of Montmorency includes an additional twelve eagles or sixteen altogether instead of four previously).

On the other wing the French at last routed the Flemish cavalry and captured <a href="Ferdinand%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Ferdinand, Count of Flanders</a>, one of the leaders of the coalition. In the centre the battle was now a melee between the two mounted reserves led by the King and the Emperor in person. Here too the Imperial forces suffered defeat, Otto himself being saved only by the devotion of a handful of Saxon knights. The Imperial Eagle Standard was captured by the French.

The day was already decided in favour of the French when their wings began to close inwards to cut off the retreat of the imperial centre. The battle closed with the celebrated stand of <a href="Reginald%20of%20Boulogne">Reginald of Boulogne</a> (Renaud de Dammartin), a former vassal of King Philip, who formed a ring of seven hundred <a href="Brabant%20%28duchy%29">Brabant</a> pikemen, and not only defied every attack of the French cavalry, but himself made repeated charges or sorties with his small force of knights. Eventually, and long after the Imperial army had begun its retreat, the gallant <a href="Sheltron">schiltrom</a> formation was ridden down and annihilated by a charge of three thousand men-at-arms. Reginald was taken prisoner in the melee. The prisoners also included two other counts, Hainaut Ferrand and <a href="William%20Longesp%C3%A9e%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">William Longespée</a>, twenty-five barons and over a hundred knights. The death toll amounted to about 170 knights of the defeated party, and many thousands of foot soldiers on either side.

According to Jean Favier, Bouvines is "one of the most decisive and symbolic battles in the history of France". For Philippe Contamine, "the battle of Bouvines had both important consequences and a great impact".

Philip returned to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> triumphant, marching his captive prisoners behind him in a long procession, as his grateful subjects came out to greet the victorious king. In the aftermath of the battle, Otto retreated to his castle of <a href="Harzburg">Harzburg</a> and was soon overthrown as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> by <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a>, who had already been recognized as emperor in the south a year and a half prior. Count Ferdinand remained imprisoned following his defeat, while King John obtained a five-year truce, on very lenient terms given the circumstances.

Philip's decisive victory was crucial in ordering politics in both England and France. In the former, so weakened was the defeated King <a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a> that he soon needed to submit to his barons' demands and agree to the <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, limiting the power of the crown and establishing the basis for common law. In the latter, the battle was instrumental in forming the <a href="Absolute%20monarchy%20in%20France">strong central monarchy</a> that would characterize France until the first <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. It was also the first battle in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> in which the full value of infantry was realized.

Philip conquered most of Plantagenet's continental possessions, namely <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>, <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a>, and the <a href="Touraine">Touraine</a>, leading to the effective end of the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a>.

In thanksgiving for the victory, Philip Augustus founded the Abbey of Notre Dame de la Victoire, between Senlis and Mont l'Evêque.

In 1914, to mark the seventh centenary, <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Dehau">Félix Dehau</a> had the parish church of Bouvines rebuilt with a number of stained-glass windows representing the history of the battle.

In 2014, the eighth centenary was commemorated in Bouvines by an association called Bouvines 2014. A series of events, including an official ceremony and a show called "Bouvines la Bataille" gathering more than 6000 viewers in Bouvines.

The battle of Bouvines is the subject of one episode of the French documentary series "Butterfly Effect" ("Points de repères" in French) broadcast on Curiosity Stream in 2016, called "King Philippe of France and Richard the Lionheart of England".

Battle of Actium

The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the <a href="Final%20War%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">Final War of the Roman Republic</a>, a naval engagement between <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a> and the combined forces of <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> on 2 September 31 BC, on the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a> near the promontory of <a href="Actium">Actium</a>, in the Roman province of <a href="Epirus%20vetus">Epirus Vetus</a> in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. Octavian's fleet was commanded by <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a>, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>.

Octavian's victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions. He adopted the title of <a href="Princeps">Princeps</a> ("first citizen") and some years later was awarded the title of <a href="Augustus%23First%20settlement">Augustus</a> ("revered") by the Roman Senate. This became the name by which he was known in later times. As Augustus, he retained the trappings of a restored Republican leader, but historians generally view this consolidation of power and the adoption of these honorifics as the end of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> and the beginning of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

The alliance between <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a>, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Marcus Lepidus</a>, commonly known as the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a>, was renewed for a five-year term in 38 BC. However, the triumvirate broke down when Octavian saw <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>, the professed son of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and Queen <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra VII</a> of Egypt, as a major threat to his power. This occurred when <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, the other most influential member of the triumvirate, abandoned his wife, Octavian's sister <a href="Octavia%20the%20Younger">Octavia Minor</a>. Afterwards he moved to Egypt to start a long-term romance with Cleopatra, becoming the de facto stepfather to Caesarion. Such an affair was doomed to become a political scandal. Antony was inevitably perceived by Octavian and the majority of the Roman Senate as the leader of a separatist movement that threatened to break the unity of the Roman Republic.
Octavian's prestige and, more importantly, the loyalty of his legions, had been initially boosted by Julius Caesar's legacy of 44 BC, by which 19-year-old Octavian was officially adopted as Caesar's only son and the sole legitimate heir of his enormous wealth. Antony had been the most important and most successful senior officer in Caesar's army ("<a href="Master%20of%20the%20Horse%23Magister%20Equitum%20%28Ancient%20Rome%29">magister equitum</a>") and, thanks to his military record, claimed a substantial share of the political support of Caesar's soldiers and veterans. Both Octavian and Antony had fought against their common enemies in the civil war that followed the assassination of Caesar.

After years of loyal cooperation with Octavian, Antony started to act independently, eventually raising his rival's suspicion that he was vying to become sole master of Rome. When he left Octavia Minor and moved to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> to become Cleopatra's official partner, he led many Roman politicians to believe that he was trying to become the unchecked ruler of Egypt and of other eastern kingdoms, while still maintaining his command over the many Roman legions in the East. As a personal challenge to Octavian's prestige, Antony tried to get Caesarion accepted as a true heir of Caesar, even though the legacy did not mention him. Antony and Cleopatra formally elevated Caesarion, then 13, to power in 34 BC, giving him the vague but alarming title of <a href="King%20of%20Kings">"King of the Kings"</a> (<a href="Donations%20of%20Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria</a>). Being a son of Caesar, such an entitlement was felt as a threat to Roman republican traditions. According to a widespread belief, Antony had once offered a <a href="diadem">diadem</a> to Caesar. Thereafter, Octavian started a propaganda war, denouncing Antony as an enemy of Rome, asserting that he was seeking to establish a personal monarchy over the entire Roman Empire on the behalf of Caesarion, circumventing the Roman Senate. It was also said that Antony intended to move the capital of the empire to Alexandria.

As the Second Triumvirate formally expired on the last day of 33 BC, Antony wrote to the Senate that he did not wish to be reappointed. He hoped that he might be regarded by them as their champion against the ambition of Octavian, whom he presumed would not be willing to abandon his position in a similar manner. The causes of mutual dissatisfaction between the two had been continually accumulating. Antony complained that Octavian had exceeded his powers in deposing <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Lepidus</a>, in taking over the countries held by <a href="Sextus%20Pompeius">Sextus Pompeius</a>, and in enlisting soldiers for himself without sending half to him. Octavian complained that Antony had no authority for being in Egypt; that his execution of Sextus Pompeius was illegal; that his treachery to the <a href="king%20of%20Armenia">king of Armenia</a> disgraced the Roman name; that he had not sent half the proceeds of the spoils to Rome according to his agreement; and that his connection with Cleopatra and the acknowledgment of Caesarion as a legitimate son of Caesar were a degradation of his office and a menace to himself.

During 32 BC, a third of the Senate and both <a href="consul">consul</a>s allied with Antony. The consuls had determined to conceal the extent of Antony's demands. <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Ahenobarbus%20%28consul%2032%20BC%29">Gnaeus Ahenobarbus</a> seems to have wished to keep quiet, but <a href="Gaius%20Sosius">Gaius Sosius</a> on 1 January made an elaborate speech in favor of Antony, and would have proposed the confirmation of his act had it not been vetoed by a tribune. Octavian was not present, but at the next meeting made a reply of such a nature that the consuls both left Rome to join Antony; Antony, when he heard of it, after publicly divorcing Octavia, came at once to <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> with Cleopatra, where a vast fleet was gathered from all parts of the East, of which Cleopatra furnished a large proportion. After staying with his allies at Samos, Antony moved to Athens. His land forces, which had been in Armenia, came down to the coast of Asia, and embarked under L. Canidius Crassus.

Octavian was not behind in his strategic preparations. Military operations began in 31 BC, when Octavian's general <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a> captured <a href="Methoni%2C%20Messenia">Methone</a>, a Greek town allied to Antony. However, by the publication of Antony's will, which had been put into his hands by the traitor <a href="Plancus">Plancus</a>, and by carefully letting it be known in Rome what preparations were going on at <a href="Samos">Samos</a> and how entirely Antony was acting as the agent of Cleopatra, Octavian produced such a violent outburst of feeling that he easily obtained Antony's deposition from the consulship of 31 BC, for which Antony had been designated. In addition to the deposition Octavian procured a vote for a proclamation of war against Cleopatra – well understood to mean against Antony, though he was not named. In doing this, the Senate issued a war declaration and deprived Antony of any legal authority.

Antony meant to anticipate an attack by a descent upon Italy towards the end of 32 BC, and went as far as <a href="Corcyra">Corcyra</a>. But finding the sea guarded by a squadron of Octavian's ships, he retired to winter at <a href="Patrae">Patrae</a> while his fleet for the most part lay in the <a href="Ambracian%20Gulf">Ambracian Gulf</a>, and his land forces encamped near the promontory of Actium, while the opposite side of the narrow strait into the Ambracian Gulf was protected by a tower and troops.

After Octavian's proposals for a conference with Antony had been scornfully rejected, both sides prepared for the struggle the next year. The early months passed without notable event, beyond some successes of Agrippa on the coasts of Greece, meant to divert Antony's attention. It was not until the latter part of August that troops were landed in the neighborhood of Antony's camp on the north side of the strait. Still Antony could not be tempted out. It took some months for his full strength to arrive from the various places in which his allies or his ships had wintered, and during these months not only was Agrippa continuing his descent upon Greek towns and coasts, but in various cavalry skirmishes Octavian had so far prevailed that Antony abandoned the north side of the strait and confined his soldiers to the southern camp. Cleopatra now earnestly advised that garrisons should be put into strong towns, and that the main fleet should return to Alexandria. The large contingent furnished by Egypt gave her advice as much weight as her personal influence over Antony, and it appears that this movement was agreed.

Octavian learned of this and debated how to prevent it. At first of a mind to let Antony sail and then attack him, he was prevailed upon by <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a> to give battle. On 1 September he issued an address to his fleet, preparing them for battle. The next day was wet and the sea was rough. When the trumpet signal for the start rang out, Antony's fleet began issuing from the straits, and the ships moved into line and remained quiet. Octavian, after a short hesitation, ordered his vessels to steer to the right and pass the enemy's ships. For fear of being surrounded, Antony was forced to give the word to attack.

The two fleets met outside the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Actium">Gulf of Actium</a> (today <a href="Preveza">Preveza</a>), on the morning of 2 September 31 BC. Antony's fleet numbered 500, of which 230 were large <a href="warship">war galleys</a> with towers full of armed men. He led these through the straits towards the open sea. Octavian had about 250 warships. Octavian's fleet was waiting beyond the straits, led by the experienced admiral Agrippa, commanding from the left wing of the fleet, <a href="Lucius%20Arruntius">Lucius Arruntius</a> the centre and <a href="Marcus%20Lurius">Marcus Lurius</a> the right. <a href="Titus%20Statilius%20Taurus">Titus Statilius Taurus</a> commanded Octavian's armies, who observed the battle from shore to the north of the straits. Antony and <a href="Lucius%20Gellius%20Publicola%20%28consul%2036%20BC%29">Gellius Publicola</a> commanded the right wing of the Antonian fleet, while Marcus Octavius and Marcus Insteius commanded the center, with Cleopatra's squadron positioned behind them. <a href="Gaius%20Sosius">Gaius Sosius</a> launched the initial attack from the left wing of the fleet, while Antony's chief lieutenant <a href="Publius%20Canidius%20Crassus">Publius Canidius Crassus</a> was in command of the triumvir's land forces.

It is estimated that Antony had around 140 ships, vs 260 ships of Octavian's fleet. What Antony lacked in quantity was made up for in quality (of vessel), as his ships were mainly the standard Roman warship, <a href="quinquereme">quinquereme</a>s with smaller <a href="quadrireme">quadrireme</a>s, heavier and wider than Octavian's and making them ideal weapon platforms. Antony's personal flag ship, like those of his admirals, was a "ten". An "eight" war galley had around 200 heavy marines, archers, and at least 6 ballista catapults. Being larger than Octavian's ships, Antony's war galleys were very difficult to board in close combat, and were able to rain down missiles onto their smaller and lower opponent's ships. The bows of the galleys were armored with <a href="bronze">bronze</a> plates and square-cut timbers, making a successful ramming attack with similar equipment difficult. The only way to disable such a ship was to smash its oars, rendering it immobile and hopefully, isolated from the rest of its fleet. The main weakness of Antony's ships was their lack of maneuverability; such a ship, once isolated from support of its fleet, could be swamped with boarding attacks. However many of his ships were undermanned with rowing crews; there had been a severe malaria outbreak while they were waiting for Octavian's fleet to arrive.

Octavian's fleet was largely made up of smaller "<a href="Liburna">Liburnian</a>" vessels. Octavian's ships, although smaller, were still manageable in the heavy surf and could out-manoeuvre Antony's ships, get in close, attack the above-deck crew with a shower of arrows and ballista-launched stones, and then retreat. Moreover, his crews were better-trained, professional, well fed and rested.
A medium ballista was capable of penetrating the sides of most warships at close range and had an effective range of around 200 yards. Most ballista firing was aimed at the marines on the fighting decks of the ships.

Before the battle one of Antony's generals, <a href="Quintus%20Dellius">Quintus Dellius</a>, had defected to Octavian, bringing with him Antony's battle plans.

Shortly after midday, Antony was forced to extend his line from the protection of the shore and finally engage the enemy. Seeing this Octavian's fleet put to sea. Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet, aware of this strategy, stayed out of range. By about noon the fleets were in formation but Octavian refused to be drawn out so Antony was forced to attack. The battle raged all afternoon without decisive result.

Cleopatra's fleet, in the rear, retreated to the open sea without engaging. A breeze sprang up in the right direction, and the Egyptian ships were soon hurrying out of sight.

Antony had not observed the signal, and believing that it was mere panic and all was lost, followed the flying squadron. The contagion spread fast; everywhere sails were seen unfurling, and towers and other heavy fighting gear going by the board. Some fought on, and it was not until long after nightfall, when many a ship was blazing from the firebrands thrown upon them, that the work was done. Making the best of the situation, he burned those ships he could no longer man, while clustering the remainder tightly together. With many oarsmen dead or unfit to serve, the powerful, head-on ramming tactic for which the Octaries had been designed was now impossible. Antony transferred to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape, taking a few ships with him as an escort to help break through Octavian's lines. Those left behind were captured or sunk.

A differing account of the battle is argued by J.M. Carter. He postulates that Antony knew he was surrounded and had nowhere to run. To try to turn this to his advantage, Antony gathered his ships around him in a quasi-horseshoe formation, staying close to the shore for safety. Then, should Octavian's ships approach Antony's, the sea would push them into the shore. Antony foresaw that he would not be able to defeat Octavian's forces, so he and Cleopatra stayed in the rear of the formation. Eventually, Antony sent the ships on the northern part of the formation to attack. He had them move out to the north, spreading out Octavian's ships which up until now were tightly arranged. He sent <a href="Gaius%20Sosius">Gaius Sosius</a> down to the south to spread the remaining ships out to the south. This left a hole in the middle of Octavian's formation. Antony seized the opportunity and with Cleopatra on her ship and him on a different ship, sped through the gap and escaped, abandoning his entire force.

With the end of the battle, Octavian exerted himself to save the crews of the burning vessels, and had to spend the whole night on board. On the next day, as much of the land army as had not escaped to their own lands submitted or were followed in their retreat to Macedonia and forced to surrender, and Antony's camp was occupied, bringing an end to the war.

The political consequences were far-reaching. Under cover of darkness some 19 legions and 12,000 <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> fled before Antony was able to engage Octavian in a land battle. Thus, after Antony lost his fleet, his army, which had been equal to that of Octavian, deserted. Antony, though he had not laid down his imperium, was a fugitive and a rebel without that shadow of a legal position which the presence of the consuls and senators had given him in the previous year. Some of the victorious fleet went in pursuit of him; but Octavian himself visited Greece and Asia, and spent the winter at Samos; though he was obliged to go for a short time to Brundisium to settle a mutiny and arrange for assignations of land.

At <a href="Samos">Samos</a>, Octavian received a message from <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a> with the present of a gold crown and throne, offering to abdicate in favor of her sons. She was allowed to believe that she would be well treated, for Octavian was anxious to secure her for his triumph. Antony, who had found himself generally deserted, after vainly attempting to secure the army stationed near Paraetonium under Pinarius and sending his eldest son <a href="Marcus%20Antonius%20Antyllus">Antyllus</a> with money to Octavian and an offer to live at Athens as a private citizen, found himself in the spring attacked on two sides. <a href="Cornelius%20Gallus">C. Cornelius Gallus</a> was advancing from Paraetonium; and Octavian landed at Pelusium, with the connivance it was believed of Cleopatra. Antony was defeated by Gallus, and returning to Egypt, advanced on Pelusium.

Despite a victory at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on 31 July 30 BC, more of Antony's men deserted, leaving him with insufficient forces to fight Octavian. A slight success over Octavian's tired soldiers encouraged him to make a general attack, in which he was decisively beaten. Failing to escape on board a ship, he stabbed himself upon mistakenly believing that Cleopatra had already died. He did not die at once, and when he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, he insisted on being taken to the mausoleum in which Cleopatra was hiding, and died in her arms. She was shortly afterwards brought to the palace and vainly attempted to move Octavian to pity.

Cleopatra committed suicide, on 12 August 30 BC. In one account, she put an end to her life by the bite of an <a href="asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a> conveyed to her in a basket of figs. Octavian had <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a> killed later that month, finally securing his legacy as Caesar's only 'son'.

Octavian's victory at <a href="Actium">Actium</a> gave him sole and uncontested control of "Mare Nostrum" (Our Sea, i.e., the Roman Mediterranean) and he became "Augustus Caesar" and the "first citizen" of Rome. This victory, consolidating his power over every Roman institution, marked the transition of Rome from Republic to Empire. Egypt's surrender following Cleopatra's death marked the final demise of both the <a href="Hellenistic%20Period">Hellenistic Period</a> and the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>.

Zebrafish are also closely related to the genus "<a href="Devario">Devario</a>", as demonstrated by a <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a> of close species. The zebrafish was referred to in scientific literature as "Brachydanio rerio" for many years until its reassignment to the genus "Danio".

The zebrafish is native to the streams of the southeastern <a href="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> region, and is found in parts of <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, and <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>. The species arose in the <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> region in eastern India, and commonly inhabits streams, canals, ditches, ponds, and slow-moving or <a href="stagnant%20%28water%29">stagnant</a> water bodies, including <a href="rice%20paddy">rice fields</a>. Zebrafish have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to parts of the United States, presumably by deliberate release or by escape from <a href="fish%20farming">fish farms</a>.

The zebrafish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal, blue stripes on the side of the body, which are reminiscent of a <a href="zebra">zebra</a>'s stripes, and which extend to the end of the <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a>. Its shape is <a href="wikt%3Afusiform">fusiform</a> and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. The male is <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>-shaped, with gold stripes between the blue stripes; the female has a larger, whitish belly and silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females exhibit a small <a href="Fish%20anatomy%23Reproductive%20system">genital papilla</a> in front of the <a href="anal%20fin">anal fin</a> origin. The zebrafish can grow to in length, although it seldom grows larger than in captivity. Its lifespan in captivity is around two to three years, although in ideal conditions, this may be extended to over five years.

The approximate <a href="generation%20time">generation time</a> for "Danio rerio" is three months. A male must be present for <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a> and <a href="spawn%20%28biology%29">spawning</a> to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of two to three days, laying hundreds of eggs in each <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes "D. rerio" a convenient research model <a href="species">species</a>.

The zebrafish embryo develops rapidly, with precursors to all major organs appearing within 36 hours of fertilization. The embryo begins as a yolk with a single enormous cell on top (see image, 0 h panel), which divides into two (0.75 h panel) and continues dividing until there are thousands of small cells (3.25 h panel). The cells then migrate down the sides of the yolk (8 h panel) and begin forming a head and tail (16 h panel). The tail then grows and separates from the body (24 h panel). The yolk shrinks over time because the fish uses it for food as it matures during the first few days (72 h panel). After a few months, the adult fish reaches reproductive maturity (bottom panel).

To encourage the fish to spawn, some researchers use a fish tank with a sliding bottom insert, which reduces the depth of the pool to simulate the shore of a river. Zebrafish spawn best in the morning due to their <a href="Circadian%20rhythms">Circadian rhythms</a>. Researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes using this method. Male zebrafish are furthermore known to respond to more pronounced markings on females, i.e., "good stripes", but in a group, males will mate with whichever females they can find. What attracts females is not currently understood. The presence of plants, even plastic plants, also apparently encourages spawning.

Zebrafish are <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>, primarily eating <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>, <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, insects and insect <a href="larva">larva</a>e, although they can eat a variety of other foods, such as worms and small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, if their preferred food sources are not readily available.

In research, adult zebrafish are often fed with brine shrimp, or paramecia.

Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists. Their enduring popularity can be attributed to their playful disposition, as well as their rapid breeding, aesthetics, cheap price and broad availability. They also do well in schools or <a href="Shoaling%20and%20schooling">shoals</a> of six or more, and interact well with other fish species in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to "<a href="Oodinium">Oodinium</a>" or velvet disease, <a href="microsporidia">microsporidia</a> ("Pseudoloma neurophilia"), and "<a href="Mycobacterium">Mycobacterium</a>" species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank.

The Zebra Danio was also used to make genetically modified fish and were the first species to be sold as <a href="GloFish">GloFish</a> (fluorescent colored fish).

The min. aquarium base dimensions should be 90x30cm.

In late 2003, <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a> zebrafish that express <a href="green%20fluorescent%20protein">green</a>, red, and <a href="yellow%20fluorescent%20protein">yellow fluorescent protein</a>s became commercially available in the United States. The fluorescent strains are tradenamed <a href="GloFish">GloFish</a>; other cultivated varieties include "golden", "sandy", "longfin" and "leopard".

The leopard danio, previously known as "Danio frankei", is a spotted colour <a href="morph%20%28zoology%29">morph</a> of the zebrafish which arose due to a pigment mutation. <a href="Xanthochromism">Xanthistic</a> forms of both the zebra and leopard pattern, along with long-finned subspecies, have been obtained via selective breeding programs for the aquarium trade.

Various transgenic and mutant strains of zebrafish were stored at the <a href="China%20Zebrafish%20Resource%20Center">China Zebrafish Resource Center</a> (CZRC), a <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a>, which was jointly supported by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology%20of%20China">Ministry of Science and Technology of China</a> and the <a href="Chinese%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a>.

The <a href="Zebrafish%20Information%20Network">Zebrafish Information Network</a> (<a href="ZFIN">ZFIN</a>) provides up-to-date information about current known wild-type (WT) strains of "D. rerio", some of which are listed below.



Hybrids between different "Danio" species may be fertile: for example, between "D. rerio" and "D. nigrofasciatus".

"D. rerio" is a common and useful scientific <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> for studies of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> development and <a href="gene">gene</a> function. Its use as a laboratory animal was pioneered by the American <a href="molecular%20biologist">molecular biologist</a> <a href="George%20Streisinger">George Streisinger</a> and his colleagues at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> in the 1970s and 1980s; Streisinger's zebrafish <a href="List%20of%20animals%20that%20have%20been%20cloned">clones</a> were among the earliest successful vertebrate clones created. Its importance has been consolidated by successful large-scale forward <a href="genetic%20screen">genetic screen</a>s (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens). The fish has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the <a href="Zebrafish%20Information%20Network">Zebrafish Information Network</a> (ZFIN). The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) is a genetic resource repository with 29,250 alleles available for distribution to the research community. "D. rerio" is also one of the few fish species <a href="Animals%20in%20space">to have been sent into space</a>.

Research with "D. rerio" has yielded advances in the fields of <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental biology</a>, <a href="oncology">oncology</a>, <a href="toxicology">toxicology</a>, reproductive studies, <a href="teratology">teratology</a>, <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="neurobiology">neurobiology</a>, <a href="environmental%20science">environmental science</a>s, <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> research and <a href="regenerative%20medicine">regenerative medicine</a>, and <a href="evolutionary%20theory">evolutionary theory</a>.

As a model biological system, the zebrafish possesses numerous advantages for scientists. Its <a href="genome">genome</a> has been <a href="whole%20genome%20sequencing">fully sequenced</a>, and it has well-understood, easily observable and testable developmental behaviors. Its <a href="embryogenesis">embryonic development</a> is very rapid, and its embryos are relatively large, robust, and transparent, and able to develop outside their mother. Furthermore, well-characterized mutant strains are readily available.

Other advantages include the species' nearly constant size during early development, which enables simple <a href="staining">staining</a> techniques to be used, and the fact that its two-celled embryo can be fused into a single cell to create a <a href="homozygous">homozygous</a> embryo. The zebrafish is also demonstrably similar to mammalian models and humans in toxicity testing, and exhibits a diurnal sleep cycle with similarities to mammalian sleep behavior. However, zebrafish are not a universally ideal research model; there are a number of disadvantages to their scientific use, such as the absence of a standard diet and the presence of small but important differences between zebrafish and mammals in the roles of some genes related to human disorders.

Zebrafish have the ability to <a href="Regeneration%20%28biology%29">regenerate</a> their fins, skin, heart, <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> <a href="hair%20cell">hair cell</a>s, and brain during their larval stages. In 2011, the <a href="British%20Heart%20Foundation">British Heart Foundation</a> ran an advertising campaign publicising its intention to study the applicability of this ability to humans, stating that it aimed to raise £50 million in research funding.

Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate <a href="photoreceptor%20cells">photoreceptor cells</a> and <a href="retina">retina</a>l neurons following injury, which has been shown to be mediated by the dedifferentiation and proliferation of <a href="Muller%20glia">Müller glia</a>. Researchers frequently <a href="amputate">amputate</a> the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations. It has been found that <a href="Histone%20methylation">histone demethylation</a> occurs at the site of the amputation, switching the zebrafish's cells to an "active", regenerative, stem cell-like state. In 2012, Australian scientists published a study revealing that zebrafish use a specialised <a href="protein">protein</a>, known as <a href="fibroblast%20growth%20factor">fibroblast growth factor</a>, to ensure their <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a>s heal without <a href="glial%20scar">glial scar</a>ring after injury. In addition, <a href="hair%20cell">hair cell</a>s of the posterior <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> have also been found to regenerate following damage or developmental disruption. Study of gene expression during regeneration has allowed for the identification of several important signaling pathways involved in the process, such as <a href="Wnt%20signaling">Wnt signaling</a> and <a href="Fibroblast%20growth%20factor">Fibroblast growth factor</a>.

In probing disorders of the nervous system, including neurodegenerative diseases, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and deafness, researchers are using the zebrafish to understand how the genetic defects underlying these conditions cause functional abnormalities in the human brain, spinal cord and sensory organs. Researchers have also studied the zebrafish to gain new insights into the complexities of human musculoskeletal diseases, such as <a href="muscular%20dystrophy">muscular dystrophy</a>. Another focus of zebrafish research is to understand how a gene called <a href="Hedgehog%20%28gene%29">Hedgehog</a>, a biological signal that underlies a number of human cancers, controls cell growth.

Due to their short lifecycles and relatively large clutch sizes, zebrafish are a useful model for genetic studies. A common <a href="reverse%20genetics">reverse genetics</a> technique is to <a href="gene%20knockdown">reduce gene expression</a> or modify <a href="Splicing%20%28genetics%29">splicing</a> using <a href="Morpholino">Morpholino</a> <a href="antisense">antisense</a> technology. Morpholino <a href="oligonucleotide">oligonucleotide</a>s (MO) are stable, synthetic <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s that contain the same <a href="nucleoside">bases</a> as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they can reduce the <a href="gene%20expression">expression</a> of specific genes or block other processes from occurring on RNA. MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules, allowing diffusion between cells.

A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a <a href="genome%23Genome%20evolution">duplication</a> after the divergence of <a href="ray-finned%20fish">ray-finned fish</a>es and <a href="lobe-finned%20fish">lobe-finned fish</a>es, it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene <a href="paralog">paralog</a>s reliably due to <a href="Complementation%20%28genetics%29">complementation</a> by the other paralog. Despite the complications of the zebrafish <a href="genome">genome</a>, a number of commercially available global platforms exist for analysis of both gene expression by <a href="expression%20profiling">microarrays</a> and promoter regulation using <a href="ChIP-on-chip">ChIP-on-chip</a>.

The <a href="Wellcome%20Trust%20Sanger%20Institute">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</a> started the zebrafish genome sequencing project in 2001, and the full genome sequence of the Tuebingen reference strain is publicly available at the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Biotechnology%20Information">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> (NCBI)'s <a href="https%3A//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome%3Fterm%3Ddanio%2520rerio">Zebrafish Genome Page</a>. The zebrafish reference genome sequence is annotated as part of the <a href="Ensembl">Ensembl</a> <a href="http%3A//www.ensembl.org/Danio_rerio/Info/Index">project</a>, and is maintained by the <a href="Genome%20Reference%20Consortium">Genome Reference Consortium</a>.

In 2009, researchers at the <a href="Institute%20of%20Genomics%20and%20Integrative%20Biology">Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology</a> in <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, India, announced the sequencing of the genome of a wild zebrafish strain, containing an estimated 1.7 billion genetic letters. The genome of the wild zebrafish was sequenced at 39-fold coverage. Comparative analysis with the zebrafish reference genome revealed over 5 million single nucleotide variations and over 1.6 million insertion deletion variations. The zebrafish reference genome sequence of 1.4GB and over 26,000 protein coding genes was published by Kerstin Howe "et al." in 2013.

In October 2001, researchers from the <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> published "D. rerio's" complete <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence. Its length is 16,596 base pairs. This is within 100 base pairs of other related species of fish, and it is notably only 18 pairs longer than the <a href="goldfish">goldfish</a> ("Carassius auratus") and 21 longer than the <a href="carp">carp</a> ("Cyprinus carpio"). Its gene order and content are identical to the common <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> form of mitochondrial DNA. It contains 13 <a href="protein">protein</a>-coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the <a href="origin%20of%20replication">origin of replication</a> for the heavy strand. In between a grouping of five <a href="tRNA">tRNA</a> genes, a sequence resembling vertebrate origin of light strand replication is found. It is difficult to draw evolutionary conclusions because it is difficult to determine whether base pair changes have adaptive significance via comparisons with other vertebrates' <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> sequences.

In 1999, the "nacre" mutation was identified in the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian "MITF" transcription factor. Mutations in human "<a href="MITF">MITF</a>" result in eye defects and loss of pigment, a type of <a href="Waardenburg%20Syndrome">Waardenburg Syndrome</a>. In December 2005, a study of the "golden" strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as <a href="SLC24A5">SLC24A5</a>, a <a href="Solution">solute</a> carrier that appeared to be required for <a href="melanin">melanin</a> production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The <a href="Orthologue">orthologous</a> gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans. Zebrafish with the "nacre" mutation have since been bred with fish with a "roy orbison (roy)" mutation to make fish that have no melanophores or iridophores, and are transparent into adulthood. These fish are characterized by uniformly pigmented eyes and translucent skin.

Transgenesis is a popular approach to study the function of genes in zebrafish. Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system.

In 2008, researchers at <a href="Boston%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Boston Children's Hospital</a> developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies had transparent skin. This allows for detailed visualization of cellular activity, circulation, <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a> and many other phenomena. Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, the Casper strain is expected to yield insights into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers. In January 2013, Japanese scientists genetically modified a transparent zebrafish specimen to produce a visible glow during periods of intense brain activity, allowing the fish's "thoughts" to be recorded as specific regions of its brain lit up in response to external stimuli.

In January 2007, Chinese researchers at <a href="Fudan%20University">Fudan University</a> genetically modified zebrafish to detect <a href="oestrogen">oestrogen</a> pollution in lakes and rivers, which is linked to male infertility. The researchers cloned oestrogen-sensitive genes and injected them into the fertile eggs of zebrafish. The modified fish turned green if placed into water that was polluted by oestrogen.

In 2015, researchers at <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> discovered that 10% of zebrafish genes do not need to rely on the <a href="U2AF2">U2AF2</a> <a href="protein">protein</a> to initiate <a href="RNA%20splicing">RNA splicing</a>. These genes have the DNA base pairs AC and TG as repeated sequences at the ends of each <a href="intron">intron</a>. On the 3'ss (3' splicing site), the base pairs <a href="adenine">adenine</a> and <a href="cytosine">cytosine</a> alternate and repeat, and on the 5'ss (5' splicing site), their complements <a href="thymine">thymine</a> and <a href="guanine">guanine</a> alternate and repeat as well. They found that there was less reliance on U2AF2 protein than in humans, in which the protein is required for the splicing process to occur. The pattern of repeating base pairs around introns that alters RNA <a href="nucleic%20acid%20secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> was found in other <a href="teleost">teleost</a>s, but not in <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s. This indicates that an evolutionary change in tetrapods may have led to humans relying on the U2AF2 protein for RNA splicing while these genes in zebrafish undergo splicing regardless of the presence of the protein.

When close relatives mate, progeny may exhibit the detrimental effects of <a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a>. Inbreeding depression is predominantly caused by the <a href="Zygosity%23homozygous">homozygous</a> expression of recessive deleterious alleles. For zebra fish, inbreeding depression might be expected to be more severe in stressful environments, including those caused by <a href="Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic pollution</a>. Exposure of zebra fish to environmental stress induced by the chemical clotrimazole, an imidazole fungicide used in agriculture and in veterinary and human medicine, amplified the effects of inbreeding on key reproductive traits. Embryo viability was significantly reduced in inbred exposed fish and there was a tendency for inbred males to sire fewer offspring.

Zebrafish have been used to make several transgenic models of cancer, including <a href="melanoma">melanoma</a>, <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>, <a href="pancreatic%20cancer">pancreatic cancer</a> and <a href="hepatocellular%20carcinoma">hepatocellular carcinoma</a>. Zebrafish expressing mutated forms of either the BRAF or NRAS <a href="oncogene">oncogene</a>s develop melanoma when placed onto a p53 deficient background. <a href="Histology">Histologically</a>, these tumors strongly resemble the human disease, are fully transplantable, and exhibit large-scale genomic alterations. The BRAF melanoma model was utilized as a platform for two screens published in March 2011 in the journal "Nature". In one study, by Ceol, Houvras and Zon, the model was used as a tool to understand the functional importance of genes known to be amplified and overexpressed in human melanoma. One gene, SETDB1, markedly accelerated tumor formation in the zebrafish system, demonstrating its importance as a new melanoma oncogene. This was particularly significant because SETDB1 is known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation that is increasingly appreciated to be central to tumor cell biology.

In another study, by White and Zon, an effort was made to therapeutically target the genetic program present in the tumor's origin <a href="neural%20crest">neural crest</a> cell using a chemical screening approach. This revealed that an inhibition of the DHODH protein (by a small molecule called leflunomide) prevented development of the neural crest stem cells which ultimately give rise to melanoma via interference with the process of transcriptional elongation. Because this approach would aim to target the "identity" of the melanoma cell rather than a single genetic mutation, leflunomide may have utility in treating human melanoma.

In cardiovascular research, the zebrafish has been used to model <a href="Coagulation">blood clotting</a>, <a href="Angiogenesis">blood vessel development</a>, heart failure, and <a href="congenital%20heart%20defect">congenital heart and kidney disease</a>.

In programmes of research into acute <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, a major underpinning process in many diseases, researchers have established a zebrafish model of inflammation, and its resolution. This approach allows detailed study of the genetic controls of inflammation and the possibility of identifying potential new drugs.

Zebrafish has been extensively used as a model organism to study vertebrate innate immunity. The innate immune system is capable of phagocytic activity by 28 to 30 h postfertilization (hpf) while adaptive immunity is not functionally mature until at least 4 weeks postfertilization.

As the immune system is relatively conserved between zebrafish and humans, many human infectious diseases can be modeled in zebrafish. The transparent early life stages are well suited for "in vivo" imaging and genetic dissection of host-pathogen interactions. Zebrafish models for a wide range of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens have already been established; for example, the zebrafish model for tuberculosis provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of mycobacteria. Furthermore, robotic technology has been developed for high-throughput antimicrobial drug screening using zebrafish infection models.

Another notable characteristic of the zebrafish is that it possesses four types of <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>, with <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>-sensitive cells supplementing the red, green and blue cone cell subtypes found in humans. Zebrafish can thus observe a very wide spectrum of colours. The species is also studied to better understand the development of the retina; in particular, how the cone cells of the retina become arranged into the so-called 'cone mosaic'. Zebrafish, in addition to certain other <a href="teleost">teleost</a> fish, are particularly noted for having extreme precision of cone cell arrangement.

This study of the zebrafish's retinal characteristics has also extrapolated into medical enquiry. In 2007, researchers at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> grew a type of zebrafish adult <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> found in the eyes of fish and mammals that develops into <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s in the retina. These could be injected into the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons—nearly every disease of the eye, including <a href="macular%20degeneration">macular degeneration</a>, <a href="glaucoma">glaucoma</a>, and <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>-related blindness. The researchers studied Müller <a href="glial%20cells">glial cells</a> in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years, and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were also able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats' retinas, and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team stated that they intended to develop the same approach in humans.

As demonstrated through ongoing research programmes, the zebrafish model enables researchers not only to identify genes that might underlie human disease, but also to develop novel therapeutic agents in drug discovery programmes. Zebrafish embryos have proven to be a rapid, cost-efficient, and reliable <a href="Teratogen">teratology</a> assay model. Drug screens in zebrafish can be used to identify novel classes of compounds with biological effects, or to repurpose existing drugs for novel uses; an example of the latter would be a screen which found that a commonly used statin (<a href="rosuvastatin">rosuvastatin</a>) can suppress the growth of <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> To date, 65 small-molecule screens have been carried out and at least one has led to clinical trials. Within these screens, many technical challenges remain to be resolved, including differing rates of drug absorption resulting in levels of internal exposure that cannot be extrapolated from the water concentration, and high levels of natural variation between individual animals. To understand drug effects, the internal drug exposure is essential, as this drives the pharmacological effect. Translating experimental results from zebrafish to higher vertebrates (like humans) requires concentration-effect relationships, which can be derived from <a href="pharmacokinetic">pharmacokinetic</a> and <a href="pharmacodynamic">pharmacodynamic</a> analysis. To date, only a pharmacokinetic model for <a href="paracetamol">paracetamol</a> has been developed in zebrafish larvae. The potential for pharmacological analyses in this organism is however promising.

Battle of Adwa

The Battle of Adwa (<a href="Amharic">Amharic</a>: አድዋ; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name "Adua") was fought on 2 March 1896/Yekatit 23, 1889 according to Ethiopian calendar between the <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Ethiopian Empire</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Kingdom of Italy</a> near the town of <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a>, Ethiopia, in <a href="Tigray%20Region">Tigray</a>. This climactic battle of the <a href="First%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">First Italo-Ethiopian War</a>, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.

As the 20th century approached, Africa had been carved up among the European powers at the <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference</a>. The two independent exceptions were the <a href="Liberia">Republic of Liberia</a> on the west coast and Ethiopia, or then still commonly known as Abyssinia, in the eastern Horn of Africa region. The newly unified <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861-1946%29">Kingdom of Italy</a> was a relative newcomer to the imperialist <a href="scramble%20for%20Africa">scramble for Africa</a>. Italy had two recently obtained African territories: <a href="Italian%20Eritrea">Eritrea</a> and <a href="Italian%20Somalia">Italian Somalia</a>. Both were near Ethiopia on the Horn of Africa. Italy sought to improve its position in Africa by conquering Ethiopia and joining it with its two territories. Menelik II as the contemporary Ethiopian leader pitted Italy against its European rivals while stockpiling weapons to defend Ethiopia against the Italians.

In 1889, the Italians signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wuchale">Treaty of Wuchale</a> with then "<a href="Negus">Negus</a>" <a href="Menelik%20II%20of%20Ethiopia">Menelik</a> of <a href="Shewa">Shewa</a>. The treaty ceded territories previously part of Ethiopia, namely the provinces of <a href="Bogos">Bogos</a>, <a href="Hamasien">Hamasien</a>, <a href="Akkele%20Guzay">Akkele Guzay</a>, <a href="Serae">Serae</a>, and parts of <a href="Tigray%20Province">Tigray</a>. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> of the Kingdom of Italy. The <a href="Amharic">Amharic</a> version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.

The Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of the treaty. As a result, Italy and Ethiopia faced off in what was later to be known as the <a href="First%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">First Italo-Ethiopian War</a>. In December 1894, <a href="Bahta%20Hagos">Bahta Hagos</a> led a rebellion against the Italians in <a href="Akkele%20Guzay">Akkele Guzay</a>, in what was then Italian controlled <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>. Units of General <a href="Oreste%20Baratieri">Oreste Baratieri</a>'s army under Major crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the <a href="Tigray%20Province">Tigrayan</a> capital, <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a>. In January 1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat <a href="Ethiopian%20aristocratic%20and%20court%20titles%23Men%27s%20honorifics">Ras</a> <a href="Mengesha%20Yohannes">Mengesha Yohannes</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coatit">Battle of Coatit</a>, forcing Mengesha to retreat further south.

By late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 1895, "<a href="Ethiopian%20aristocratic%20and%20court%20titles%23Men%27s%20honorifics">Ras</a>" <a href="Ras%20Makonnen">Makonnen</a>, "Ras" <a href="Welle%20Betul">Welle Betul</a> and "Ras" <a href="Mengesha%20Yohannes">Mengesha Yohannes</a> commanding a larger Ethiopian group of Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amba%20Alagi%20%281895%29">Battle of Amba Alagi</a>. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible positions in <a href="Tigray%20Province">Tigray</a>, where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General <a href="Oreste%20Baratieri">Oreste Baratieri</a>, commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor <a href="Menelik%20II%20of%20Ethiopia">Menelik</a> the second's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.

On the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera, met with his <a href="Brigadier%20General">brigadiers</a> <a href="Matteo%20Albertone">Matteo Albertone</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Arimondi">Giuseppe Arimondi</a>, <a href="Vittorio%20Dabormida">Vittorio Dabormida</a>, and <a href="Giuseppe%20Ellena">Giuseppe Ellena</a>, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note, revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as <a href="Asmara">Asmara</a>. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale. Dabormida exclaiming, "Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat." Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00. His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.

The Italian army comprised four <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s totaling 17,978 troops, with fifty-six artillery pieces. However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that "several thousand" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effectives. One brigade under General Albertone was made up of <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>n <a href="askari">askari</a> led by Italian officers. The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. While these included elite <a href="Bersaglieri">Bersaglieri</a> and <a href="Alpini">Alpini</a> units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed "d'Africa" <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s for service in Africa. Additionally a limited number of troops were drafted from the <a href="Cacciatori%20d%27Africa">Cacciatori d'Africa</a> units of local Italian settlers.

As Chris Prouty describes:



Estimates for the Ethiopian forces under Menelik range from a low of 73,000 to a high of over 120,000, outnumbering the Italians by an estimated five or six times. The forces were divided among Emperor Menelik, Empress <a href="Taytu%20Betul">Taytu Betul</a>, "<a href="Ethiopian%20aristocratic%20and%20court%20titles">Ras</a>" <a href="Wale%20Betul">Wale Betul</a>, "Ras" <a href="Mengesha%20Atikem">Mengesha Atikem</a>, "Ras" <a href="Ras%20Mengesha%20Yohannes">Mengesha Yohannes</a>, "Ras" <a href="Alula%20Engida">Alula Engida</a>, "Ras" <a href="Mikael%20of%20Wollo">Mikael of Wollo</a>, "Ras" <a href="Ras%20Makonnen">Makonnen Wolde Mikael</a>, "<a href="Fitawrari">Fitawrari</a>" <a href="Gebeyyehu">Gebeyyehu</a>, and "<a href="Ethiopian%20aristocratic%20and%20religious%20titles">Negus</a>" <a href="Tekle%20Haymanot%20of%20Gojjam">Tekle Haymanot Tessemma</a>. In addition, the armies were followed by a similar number of <a href="camp%20follower">camp follower</a>s who supplied the army, as had been done for centuries. Most of the army was composed of riflemen, a significant percentage of which were in Menelik's reserve; however, there were also a significant number of cavalry and infantry only armed with <a href="lance">lance</a>s. The <a href="Kuban%20Cossacks">Kuban Cossack</a> army officer <a href="Nikolay%20Leontiev">N. S. Leontiev</a> who visited Ethiopia in 1895, according to some sources, led a small team of Russian advisers and volunteers. Other sources assert that Leontiev did not in fact participate in the battle, rather he visited Ethiopia first unofficially in January 1895, and then officially as a representative of Russia in August 1895, but then left later that year, only to return after the battle of Adwa.

On the night of 29 February and the early morning of 1 March three Italian brigades advanced separately towards Adwa over narrow mountain tracks, while a fourth remained camped. <a href="David%20Levering%20Lewis">David Levering Lewis</a> states that the Italian battle plan: However, the three leading Italian brigades had become separated during their overnight march and at dawn were spread across several miles of very difficult terrain. Their sketchy maps caused Albertone to mistake one mountain for Kidane Meret, and when a scout pointed out his mistake, Albertone advanced directly into Ras Alula's position.
Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik knew his troops had exhausted the ability of the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael at the head of the <a href="Oromo%20people">Oromo</a> cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable to crossfire.

Albertone's Askari Brigade was the first to encounter the onrush of Ethiopians at 6:00, near Kidane Meret, where the Ethiopians had managed to set up their mountain artillery. Accounts of the Ethiopian artillery deployed at Adwa differ; Russian advisor <a href="Leonid%20Artamonov">Leonid Artamonov</a> wrote that it comprised forty-two Russian mountain guns supported by a team of fifteen advisers, but British historians suggest that the Ethiopian guns were Hotchkiss and Maxim pieces captured from the Egyptians or purchased from French and other European suppliers. Albertone's heavily outnumbered Askaris held their position for two hours until Albertone's capture, and under Ethiopian pressure the survivors sought refuge with Arimondi's brigade. Arimondi's brigade beat back the Ethiopians who repeatedly charged the Italian position for three hours with gradually fading strength until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 <a href="Shewa">Shewa</a>ns and swamped the Italian defenders. Two <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a> of Bersaglieri who arrived at the same moment could not help and were cut down.

Dabormida's Italian Brigade had moved to support Albertone but was unable to reach him in time. Cut off from the remainder of the Italian Army, Dabormida began a fighting retreat towards friendly positions. However, he inadvertently marched his command into a narrow valley where the Oromo cavalry under Ras Mikael slaughtered his brigade, while shouting "Ebalgume! Ebalgume!" ("Reap! Reap!"). Dabormida's remains were never found, although his brother learned from an old woman living in the area that she had given water to a mortally wounded Italian officer, "a chief, a great man with spectacles and a watch, and golden stars".

The remaining two brigades under Baratieri himself were outflanked and destroyed piecemeal on the slopes of <a href="Mount%20Belah">Mount Belah</a>. Menelik watched as <a href="Gojjam">Gojjam</a> forces under the command of <a href="Tekle%20Haymanot%20of%20Gojjam">Tekle Haymonot</a> made quick work of the last intact Italian brigade. By noon, the survivors of the Italian army were in full retreat and the battle was over.

The Italians suffered about 7,000 killed and 1,500 wounded in the battle and subsequent retreat back into Eritrea, with 3,000 taken prisoner. Brigadiers Dabormida and Arimondi were amongst the dead. Ethiopian losses have been estimated at around 4,000–5,000 killed and 8,000 wounded. In their flight to <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, the Italians left behind all of their artillery and 11,000 rifles, as well as most of their transport. As Paul B. Henze notes, "Baratieri's army had been completely annihilated while Menelik's was intact as a fighting force and gained thousands of rifles and a great deal of equipment from the fleeing Italians." The 3,000 Italian prisoners, who included Brigadier Albertone, appear to have been treated as well as could be expected under difficult circumstances, though about 200 died of their wounds in captivity. However, 800 captured askaris, regarded as traitors by the Ethiopians, had their right hands and left feet amputated. Augustus Wylde records when he visited the battlefield months after the battle, the pile of severed hands and feet was still visible, "a rotting heap of ghastly remnants." Further, many had not survived their punishment, Wylde writing how the neighborhood of Adwa "was full of their freshly dead bodies; they had generally crawled to the banks of the streams to quench their thirst, where many of them lingered unattended and exposed to the elements until death put an end to their sufferings." There does not appear to be any foundation for reports that some Italians were castrated and these may reflect confusion with the atrocious treatment of the askari prisoners.
Baratieri was relieved of his command and later charged with preparing an "inexcusable" plan of attack and for abandoning his troops in the field. He was acquitted on these charges but was described by the court martial judges as being "entirely unfit" for his command.

Public opinion in Italy was outraged. Chris Prouty offers a panoramic overview of the response in Italy to the news:
The Russian support for Ethiopia led to the advent of a Russian Red Cross mission. The Russian mission was a military mission conceived as a medical support for the Ethiopian troops. It arrived in Addis Ababa some three months after Menelik's Adwa victory.

Emperor Menelik decided not to follow up on his victory by attempting to drive the routed Italians out of their colony. The victorious Emperor limited his demands to little more than the abrogation of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wuchale">Treaty of Wuchale</a>. In the context of the prevailing balance of power, the emperor's crucial goal was to preserve Ethiopian independence. In addition, Ethiopia had just begun to emerge from a long and brutal <a href="Famines%20in%20Ethiopia">famine</a>; Harold Marcus reminds us that the army was restive over its long service in the field, short of rations, and the short rains which would bring all travel to a crawl would soon start to fall. At the time, Menelik claimed a shortage of cavalry horses with which to harry the fleeing soldiers. Chris Prouty observes that "a failure of nerve on the part of Menelik has been alleged by both Italian and Ethiopian sources." Lewis believes that it "was his farsighted certainty that total annihilation of Baratieri and a sweep into Eritrea would force the Italian people to turn a bungled colonial war into a national crusade" that stayed his hand.

As a direct result of the battle, Italy signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Addis%20Ababa">Treaty of Addis Ababa</a>, recognizing Ethiopia as an independent state. Almost forty years later, on 3 October 1935, after the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>'s weak response to the <a href="Abyssinia%20Crisis">Abyssinia Crisis</a>, the Italians launched a new military campaign endorsed by <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a>. This time the Italians employed vastly superior military technology such as tanks and aircraft, as well as <a href="chemical%20warfare">chemical warfare</a>, and the Ethiopian forces were defeated by May 1936. Following the war, Italy occupied Ethiopia for five years (1936–41), before eventually being driven out during World War II by <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and Ethiopian "Arbegnoch" (patriot) forces.

"The confrontation between Italy and Ethiopia at Adwa was a fundamental turning point in Ethiopian history," writes Henze. On a similar note, the Ethiopian historian <a href="Bahru%20Zewde">Bahru Zewde</a> observed that "few events in the modern period have brought Ethiopia to the attention of the world as has the victory at Adwa".

The <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> had sold some artillery pieces to the Ethiopian forces and paid enthusiastic compliments to the Ethiopian success. One of the documents of that time stated "The Victory immediately gained the general sympathy of Russian society and it continued to grow." The unique outlook which polyethnic Russia exhibited to Ethiopia disturbed many supporters of European nationalism during the twentieth century. The Russian <a href="Cossacks">Cossack</a> captain <a href="Nikolay%20Leontiev">Nikolay Leontiev</a> with a small escort was present at the battle as an observer.

This defeat of a colonial power and the ensuing recognition of African sovereignty became rallying points for later African nationalists during their struggle for decolonization, as well as activists and leaders of the <a href="Pan-African">Pan-African</a> movement. As the <a href="Afrocentric">Afrocentric</a> scholar Molefe Asante explains,
On the other hand, many writers have pointed out how this battle was a humiliation for the Italian military. One student of Ethiopia, Donald N. Levine, points out that for the Italians Adwa "became a national trauma which demagogic leaders strove to avenge. It also played no little part in motivating Italy's revanchist adventure in 1935". Levine also noted that the victory "gave encouragement to isolationist and conservative strains that were deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture, strengthening the hand of those who would strive to keep Ethiopia from adopting techniques imported from the modern West – resistances with which both Menelik and Ras Teferi/<a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a> would have to contend".

The victory of <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a>, which is officially celebrated across Ethiopia on the 1st of March every year, marks the momentous victory that <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> achieved against the invading <a href="Italian%20army">Italian army</a> on March 1, 1896. Most historians agree that the Battle of Adwa is the first inter-state conflict of its kind where an African army has definitively defeated a European army. Ethiopia’s decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa has inspired several <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n countries in their fight against <a href="European%20colonialism">European colonialism</a>. During the 121 years anniversary of <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a>, Ethiopian academic and <a href="social%20media">social media</a> contributor Wondwesen Tafesse posted a message on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> that reads, “Most nations have independence day, we [Ethiopians] have victory day. And, we call it…A D W A”. This message resonated with the Ethiopian social media community, and has since been shared, retweeted and posted on different social media networking sites thousands of times. The message has inspired Ethiopians, and served as a motto during the 121st celebration of the Victory of Adwa on social media.

The Victory of <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a> is a public holiday in all regional states and <a href="charter%20cities">charter cities</a> across Ethiopia. All schools, banks, post offices and government offices are closed, with the exceptions of health facilities. Some taxi services and public transports choose not to operate on this day. Shops are normally open but most close earlier than usual.

The Victory of Adwa, being a <a href="public%20holiday">public holiday</a>, is commemorated in public spaces. In <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, the Victory of Adwa is celebrated at <a href="Menelik%20Square">Menelik Square</a> with the presence of government officials, patriots, foreign diplomats and the general public. Ethiopian Police Orchestra play various patriotic songs as they walk around Menelik Square.

The public dress up in traditional Ethiopian patriotic attire. Men often wear <a href="Jodhpurs">Jodhpurs</a> pants, various types of vest tops, and carry the Ethiopian flag, various patriotic banners and placards, and traditional Ethiopian shields and swords called <a href="Shotel">Shotel</a>. Women dress up in different patterns of handcrafted traditional <a href="Ethiopian%20clothing">Ethiopian clothing</a>, known in <a href="Amharic">Amharic</a> as <a href="Habesha%20kemis">Habesha kemis</a>. Some wear black gowns on top, while others put royal crowns on their head. Women’s dressing style, like their male counterparts, imitate the traditional style of Ethiopian patriotic women. Of particular note is the dominant presence of Empress <a href="Taytu%20Betul">Taytu Betul</a> during these celebrations.

Empress <a href="Taytu%20Betul">Taytu Betul</a> is the beloved and influential wife of Emperor <a href="Menelik%20II">Menelik II</a>, who played a significant role during the Battle of Adwa. Although often overlooked, thousands of women fought during the Battle of Adwa alongside men. Some were trained as nurses to attend to the wounded, while others mainly cooked and supplied food and water to the soldiers and comforted the wounded.

In addition to <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, other major cities in Ethiopia, including <a href="Bahir%20Dar">Bahir Dar</a>, <a href="Debre%20Markos">Debre Markos</a> and the town of <a href="Adwa">Adwa</a> itself, where the Battle of Adwa took place, celebrate the Victory of Adwa in public ceremonies.

Several images and symbols are used during the commemoration of the Victory of Adwa, including the tri-coloured Green, Gold and Red Ethiopian flag, images of <a href="Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Menelik%20II">Menelik II</a> and <a href="Empress">Empress</a> <a href="Taytu%20Betul">Taytu Betul</a>, as well as other prominent kings and war generals of the time including <a href="King">King</a> <a href="Tekle%20Haymanot%20of%20Gojjam">Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam</a>, <a href="Michael%20of%20Wollo">King Michael</a> of <a href="Wollo">Wollo</a>, <a href="Dejazmach">Dejazmach</a> <a href="Balcha%20Safo">Balcha Safo</a>, <a href="Fitawrari">Fitawrari</a> <a href="Habte%20Giyorgis%20Dinagde">Habte Giyorgis Dinagde</a>, and <a href="Fitawrari">Fitawrari</a> <a href="Gebeyehu">Gebeyehu</a>, among others. Surviving members of the Ethiopian patriotic battalions wear the various medals that they collected for their participation during different battle fields. Young people often wear T-shirts adorned by Emepror <a href="Menelik%20II">Menelik II</a>, Empress <a href="Taytu">Taytu</a>, Emperor <a href="Haile%20Selassie">Haile Selassie</a> and other notable members of the Ethiopian monarchy. Popular and <a href="patriotic%20songs">patriotic songs</a> are often played on amplifiers. Of particular note are <a href="Ejigayehu%20Shibabaw">Ejigayehu Shibabaw</a>’s <a href="ballad">ballad</a> dedicated to the Battle of Adwa and <a href="Teddy%20Afro">Teddy Afro</a>’s popular song “Tikur Sew”, which literally translates to “black man or black person” – a poetic reference to Emperor <a href="Menelik%20II">Menelik II</a>’s decisive African victory over Europeans, as well as the Emperor’s darker skin complexion.

Bistability

In a <a href="dynamical%20system">dynamical system</a>, bistability means the system has two <a href="stable%20equilibrium%20%28disambiguation%29">stable equilibrium states</a>. Something that is bistable can be resting in either of two states. These rest states need not be symmetric with respect to <a href="Energy%20storage">stored energy</a>. In terms of <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a>, a bistable system has two <a href="local%20minimum">local minima</a> of potential energy separated by a peak (local maximum). An example of a mechanical device which is bistable is a <a href="light%20switch">light switch</a>. The switch lever is designed to rest in the "on" or "off" position, but not between the two.

In a <a href="conservative%20force">conservative force</a> field, bistability stems from the fact that the <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> has three <a href="equilibrium%20point">equilibrium point</a>s. Two of them are <a href="minimum">minima</a> and one is a <a href="maximum">maximum</a>. By mathematical arguments, the maximum must lie between the two minima. At rest, a particle will be in one of the minimum equilibrium positions, because that corresponds to the state of lowest energy. The maximum can be visualized as a barrier between them.

A system can transition from one state of minimal energy to the other if it is given enough activation energy to penetrate the barrier (compare <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a> and <a href="Arrhenius%20equation">Arrhenius equation</a> for the chemical case). After the barrier has been reached, the system will relax into the other minimum state in a time called the <a href="relaxation%20time">relaxation time</a>.

Bistability is widely used in <a href="digital%20electronics">digital electronics</a> devices to store <a href="binary%20number">binary</a> data. It is the essential characteristic of the <a href="flip-flop%20%28electronics%29">flip-flop</a>, a circuit widely used in latches and some types of <a href="semiconductor%20memory">semiconductor memory</a>. A bistable device can store one <a href="binary%20digit">bit</a> of binary data, with one state representing a "0" and the other state a "1". It is also used in <a href="relaxation%20oscillator">relaxation oscillator</a>s, <a href="multivibrator">multivibrator</a>s, and the <a href="Schmitt%20trigger">Schmitt trigger</a>.
<a href="Optical%20bistability">Optical bistability</a> is an attribute of certain optical devices where two resonant transmissions states are possible and stable, dependent on the input.
Bistability can also arise in biochemical systems, where it creates digital, switch-like outputs from the constituent chemical concentrations and activities. It is often associated with <a href="Hysteresis%23In%20biology">hysteresis</a> in such systems.

In the mathematical language of <a href="Dynamical%20systems%20theory">dynamic systems analysis</a>, one of the simplest bistable systems is

formula_1

This system describes a ball rolling down a curve with shape formula_2, and has three steady-states: formula_3, formula_4, and formula_5. The middle steady-state formula_6 is unstable, while the other two states are stable. The direction of change of formula_7 over time depends on the initial condition formula_8. If the initial condition is positive (formula_9), then the solution formula_7 approaches 1 over time, but if the initial condition is negative (formula_11), then formula_7 approaches −1 over time. Thus, the dynamics are "bistable". The final state of the system can be either formula_3 or formula_14, depending on the initial conditions. For the detail techniques of mathematical modelling of bistability, you are encouraged to read an accessible tutorial by Chong et al. (2015). The tutorial provides a simple example illustration of bistability using a synthetic toggle switch proposed by Gardner et al. (2000). The tutorial also use a dynamical system software XPPAUT to show practically how to see bistability captured by a saddle-node bifurcation diagram and the hysteresis behaviours when the bifurcation parameter is increased or decreased slowly over the tipping points and a protein gets turned 'On' or turned 'Off'.

The appearance of a bistable region can be understood for the model system 
formula_15
which undergoes a supercritical <a href="pitchfork%20bifurcation">pitchfork bifurcation</a> with <a href="Bifurcation%20theory">bifurcation parameter</a> formula_16.

Bistability is key for understanding basic phenomena of cellular functioning, such as decision-making processes in <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> progression, <a href="cellular%20differentiation">cellular differentiation</a>, and <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>. It is also involved in loss of cellular homeostasis associated with early events in <a href="cancer">cancer</a> onset and in <a href="prion">prion</a> diseases as well as in the origin of new species (<a href="speciation">speciation</a>).

Bistability can be generated by a positive feedback loop with an ultrasensitive regulatory step. Positive feedback loops, such as the simple X activates Y and Y activates X motif, essentially links output signals to their input signals and have been noted to be an important regulatory motif in cellular signal transduction because positive feedback loops can create switches with an all-or-nothing decision. Studies have shown that numerous biological systems, such as "Xenopus" oocyte maturation, mammalian calcium signal transduction, and polarity in budding yeast, incorporate temporal (slow and fast) positive feedback loops, or more than one feedback loop that occurs at different times. Having two different temporal positive feedback loops or “dual-time switches” allows for (a) increased regulation: two switches that have independent changeable activation and deactivation times; and (b) linked feedback loops on multiple timescales can filter noise.

Bistability can also arise in a biochemical system only for a particular range of parameter values, where the parameter can often be interpreted as the strength of the feedback. In several typical examples, the system has only one stable fixed point at low values of the parameter. A <a href="saddle-node%20bifurcation">saddle-node bifurcation</a> gives rise to a pair of new fixed points emerging, one stable and the other unstable, at a critical value of the parameter. The unstable solution can then form another saddle-node bifurcation with the initial stable solution at a higher value of the parameter, leaving only the higher fixed solution. Thus, at values of the parameter between the two critical values, the system has two stable solutions. An example of a dynamical system that demonstrates similar features is

formula_17

where formula_18 is the output, and formula_19 is the parameter, acting as the input.

Bistability can be modified to be more robust and to tolerate significant changes in concentrations of reactants, while still maintaining its "switch-like" character. Feedback on both the activator of a system and inhibitor make the system able to tolerate a wide range of concentrations. An example of this in cell biology is that activated CDK1 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 1) activates its activator Cdc25 while at the same time inactivating its inactivator, Wee1, thus allowing for progression of a cell into mitosis. Without this double feedback, the system would still be bistable, but would not be able to tolerate such a wide range of concentrations.

Bistability has also been described in the embryonic development of "Drosophila melanogaster" (the fruit fly). Examples are anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axis formation and eye development.

A prime example of bistability in biological systems is that of <a href="Sonic%20hedgehog">Sonic hedgehog</a> (Shh), a secreted signaling molecule, which plays a critical role in development. Shh functions in diverse processes in development, including patterning limb bud tissue differentiation. The Shh signaling network behaves as a bistable switch, allowing the cell to abruptly switch states at precise Shh concentrations. "gli1" and "gli2" transcription is activated by Shh, and their gene products act as transcriptional activators for their own expression and for targets downstream of Shh signaling. Simultaneously, the Shh signaling network is controlled by a negative feedback loop wherein the Gli transcription factors activate the enhanced transcription of a repressor (Ptc). This signaling network illustrates the simultaneous positive and negative feedback loops whose exquisite sensitivity helps create a bistable switch.

Bistability can only arise in biological and chemical systems if three necessary conditions are fulfilled: positive <a href="feedback">feedback</a>, a mechanism to filter out small stimuli and a mechanism to prevent increase without bound.

Bistable chemical systems have been studied extensively to analyze relaxation kinetics, <a href="non-equilibrium%20thermodynamics">non-equilibrium thermodynamics</a>, <a href="stochastic%20resonance">stochastic resonance</a>, as well as <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. In bistable spatially extended systems the onset of local correlations and propagation of traveling waves have been analyzed.

Bistability is often accompanied by <a href="hysteresis">hysteresis</a>. On a population level, if many realisations of a bistable system are considered (e.g. many bistable cells (<a href="speciation">speciation</a>)), one typically observes <a href="bimodal%20distribution">bimodal distribution</a>s. In an ensemble average over the population, the result may simply look like a smooth transition, thus showing the value of single-cell resolution.

Bistability is the ability of a material to present in two stable phases that can both exist within a given range of temperatures but above and below that range only one or the other phase exists.

Bistability as applied in the design of mechanical systems is more commonly said to be "over centre"—that is, work is done on the system to move it just past the peak, at which point the mechanism goes "over centre" to its secondary stable position. The result is a toggle-type action- work applied to the system below a threshold sufficient to send it 'over center' results in no change to the mechanism's state.

<a href="spring%20%28device%29">Springs</a> are a common method of achieving an "over centre" action. A spring attached to a simple two position ratchet-type mechanism can create a button or plunger that is clicked or toggled between two mechanical states. Many <a href="Ballpoint%20Pen">ballpoint</a> and <a href="Rollerball%20Pen">rollerball</a> retractable pens employ this type of bistable mechanism.

An even more common example of an over-center device is an ordinary electric wall switch. These switches are often designed to snap firmly into the "on" or "off" position once the toggle handle has been moved a certain distance past the center-point.

A <a href="ratchet%20%28device%29">ratchet-and-pawl</a> is an elaboration—a multi-stable "over center" system used to create irreversible motion. The pawl goes over center as it is turned in the forward direction. In this case, "over center" refers to the ratchet being stable and "locked" in a given position until clicked forward again; it has nothing to do with the ratchet being unable to turn in the reverse direction.

Bjørn Lomborg

Bjørn Lomborg (; born 6 January 1965) is a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> author and <a href="visiting%20professor">visiting professor</a> at the <a href="Copenhagen%20Business%20School">Copenhagen Business School</a> as well as President of the <a href="Copenhagen%20Consensus%20Center">Copenhagen Consensus Center</a>. He is former director of the Danish government's <a href="Environmental%20Assessment%20Institute">Environmental Assessment Institute</a> (EAI) in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, "<a href="The%20Skeptical%20Environmentalist">The Skeptical Environmentalist</a>" (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world’s rising temperature.

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the <a href="Copenhagen%20Consensus">Copenhagen Consensus</a>, a project-based conference where prominent <a href="economists">economists</a> sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of <a href="welfare%20economics">welfare economics</a>.

In 2009, "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>" cited Lomborg as one of "The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics". While Lomborg campaigned against the <a href="Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions. His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 <a href="United%20Nations%20Conference%20on%20Environment%20and%20Development">United Nations Conference on Environment and Development</a>, Lomborg stated: "Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat." In 2011 and 2012, Lomborg was named a "Top 100 Global Thinker" by <a href="Foreign%20Policy">Foreign Policy</a> "for looking more right than ever on the politics of climate change".

Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the <a href="University%20of%20Georgia">University of Georgia</a>, earned an <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">M.A.</a> degree in <a href="political%20science">political science</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Aarhus">University of Aarhus</a> in 1991, and a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> degree in political science at the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a> in 1994.

Lomborg lectured in <a href="statistics">statistics</a> in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an <a href="assistant%20professor">assistant professor</a> (1994–1996) and <a href="associate%20professor">associate professor</a> (1997–2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, <a href="Copenhagen%20Business%20School">Copenhagen Business School</a>.

Early in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in <a href="collective%20action">collective action</a> <a href="Ethical%20dilemma">dilemmas</a>, simulation of <a href="political%20party">party</a> behavior in <a href="Party-list%20proportional%20representation">proportional voting systems</a>, and the use of surveys in <a href="public%20administration">public administration</a>. In 1996, Lomborg's paper, "Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma", was published in the <a href="academic%20journal">academic journal</a>, "<a href="American%20Sociological%20Review">American Sociological Review</a>".

Later, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the <a href="Environmental%20movement">environmental arena</a>. In 1998, Lomborg published four <a href="essay">essay</a>s about the state of the <a href="environment%20%28biophysical%29">environment</a> in the leading Danish newspaper "<a href="Politiken">Politiken</a>", which according to him "resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers." This led to the "Skeptical Environmentalist", whose English translation was published as a work in <a href="environmental%20economics">environmental economics</a> by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited "Global Crises, Global Solutions", which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled "."

In March 2002, the newly elected <a href="Centre-right">center-right</a> <a href="prime%20minister">prime minister</a>, <a href="Anders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen">Anders Fogh Rasmussen</a>, appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new <a href="Environmental%20Assessment%20Institute">Environmental Assessment Institute</a> (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

Lomborg has created several short videos for the prominent educational website <a href="Prager%20University">Prager University</a>, an unaccredited conservative Institute, founded by talk show host, Dennis Prager. His videos focus on environmental science.

Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing <a href="world">global</a> welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>". A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, "<a href="Global%20Crises%2C%20Global%20Solutions">Global Crises, Global Solutions</a>", edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Press">Cambridge University Press</a>.

In 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established <a href="Copenhagen%20Consensus%20Center">Copenhagen Consensus Center</a>, a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference. Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure. Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States. The Center was based out of a "Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center" in <a href="Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, though Lomborg himself was based in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> in the Czech Republic. In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as "a little more than $1m a year...from private donations", of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.

In April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the <a href="University%20of%20Western%20Australia">University of Western Australia</a> would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the Center's goals as a "focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.". This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer. Reports indicated that Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>'s office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation. $4 million of the total funding for the Center was to be provided by the Australian federal government, with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.

On 8 May 2015 UWA cancelled the contract for hosting the Australian Consensus Centre as "the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support". The Australian federal education minister, <a href="Christopher%20Pyne">Christopher Pyne</a>, said that he would find another university to host the ACC.

In July 2015, <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a> senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union) and Scott Ludlam. The story appeared the next day in The Australian, but described as "academic conversations" with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg’s involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University. The following week, a story appeared in the Guardian quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff’s withering rejection of the idea. Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg, citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The <a href="Australian%20Youth%20Climate%20Coalition">Australian Youth Climate Coalition</a> and <a href="350.org">350.org</a> launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.

On 21 October 2015 education minister <a href="Simon%20Birmingham">Simon Birmingham</a> told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn. It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.

In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing "The Skeptical Environmentalist", a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

In the chapter on climate change in "The Skeptical Environmentalist", he states: "This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible". <a href="Cost%E2%80%93benefit%20analyses">Cost–benefit analyses</a>, calculated by the <a href="Copenhagen%20Consensus">Copenhagen Consensus</a>, ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004. In a 2010 interview with the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>", Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: "Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world."

After the publication of "The Skeptical Environmentalist", Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the <a href="Danish%20Committees%20on%20Scientific%20Dishonesty">Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty</a> (DCSD), a body under Denmark's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Science%2C%20Technology%20and%20Innovation%20of%20Denmark">Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation</a> (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a "debate" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges claimed that "The Skeptical Environmentalist" contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

In January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question. That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a <a href="petition">petition</a> signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices. In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.

The alumni network of the <a href="Cambridge%20Programme%20for%20Sustainability%20Leadership">Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</a> (CPSL) voted "The Skeptical Environmentalist" among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.

The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

"The Lomborg Deception", a book by <a href="Howard%20Friel">Howard Friel</a>, claims to offer a "careful analysis" of the ways in which Lomborg has "selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence", and that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book; Lomborg has denied these claims in a public response. Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument response. Friel has written a reply to this response, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.

A group of scientists, Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Information%20Ethics">Journal of Information Ethics</a>",</ref> in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of "Journal of Information Ethics" by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called "the <a href="Galileo%20affair">Galileo</a> hypothesis", which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called "a history of misrepresenting" climate science.

In 2014 the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4 million to establish a "consensus centre" with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed itself and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution. On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn. (For further details see the "Copenhagen Consensus" sub-section of the "<a href="%23Copenhagen%20Consensus">Career</a>" section, above.)

Lomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that "a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich"...making fossil fuel so "inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming". In publications such as the "Wall Street Journal" he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.

Lomborg is <a href="gay">gay</a> and a <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a>. As a <a href="public%20figure">public figure</a> he has been a participant in information campaigns in Denmark about homosexuality, and states that "Being a public gay is to my view a civic responsibility. It's important to show that the width of the gay world cannot be described by a tired stereotype, but goes from leather gays on parade-wagons to suit-and-tie yuppies on the direction floor, as well as everything in between".


After the release of "The Skeptical Environmentalist" in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the <a href="News%20media">media</a>, where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international <a href="mass%20media">mass media</a>. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and <a href="Publishing">print media</a> around the world.


Bjørn Lomborg released a documentary feature film, "Cool It", on 12 November 2010 in the US. The film in part explicitly challenged <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>'s 2006 Oscar-winning environmental awareness documentary, "<a href="An%20Inconvenient%20Truth">An Inconvenient Truth</a>", and was frequently presented by the media in that light, as in the "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" headline, "Controversial ‘Cool It’ Documentary Takes on 'An Inconvenient Truth'." Reviews were generally favorable, with a media critic collective rating of 51% from <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and 61% from <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" review described it as "An urgent, intelligent, and entertaining account of the climate policy debate, with a strong focus on cost-effective solutions."

Banda Islands

The Banda Islands () are a <a href="volcanic%20group">volcanic group</a> of ten small <a href="volcanic%20island">volcanic island</a>s in the <a href="Banda%20Sea">Banda Sea</a>, about south of <a href="Seram%20Island">Seram Island</a> and about east of <a href="Java%20%28island%29">Java</a>, and are part of the <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n province of <a href="Maluku%20%28Indonesian%20province%29">Maluku</a>. The main town and administrative centre is <a href="Bandanaira">Bandanaira</a>, located on the island of the same name. They rise out of deep ocean and have a total land area of approximately . They have a population of about 15,000. Until the mid-19th century the Banda Islands were the world's only source of the spices <a href="nutmeg">nutmeg</a> and <a href="mace%20%28spice%29">mace</a>, produced from the nutmeg tree. The islands are also popular destinations for <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> and <a href="snorkeling">snorkeling</a>.

The first documented human presence in the Banda Islands comes from a rockshelter site on Pulau Ay that was in use at least 8000 years ago.

Before the arrival of Europeans, Banda had an <a href="oligarchic">oligarchic</a> form of government led by "orang kaya" ('rich men') and the Bandanese had an active and independent role in trade throughout the archipelago. Banda was the world's only source of <a href="nutmeg">nutmeg</a> and <a href="mace%20%28spice%29">mace</a>, spices used as flavourings, medicines, and preserving agents that were at the time highly valued in European markets. They were sold by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> traders to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a>s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location.

The first written accounts of Banda are in "Suma Oriental", a book written by the <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> <a href="Tom%C3%A9%20Pires">Tomé Pires</a> who was based in <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a> from 1512 to 1515 but visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500–3000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to Malacca, although shipments from Banda were also being made by <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a> traders.

In addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant <a href="entrep%C3%B4t">entrepôt</a> trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from <a href="Ternate">Ternate</a> and <a href="Tidore">Tidore</a> in the north, <a href="bird-of-paradise">bird-of-paradise</a> feathers from the <a href="Aru%20Islands">Aru Islands</a> and western <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, "massoi" bark for traditional medicines and salves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton "<a href="batik">batik</a>" from <a href="Java">Java</a>, "<a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calicoes</a>" from <a href="India">India</a> and "<a href="ikat">ikat</a>" from the <a href="Lesser%20Sundas">Lesser Sundas</a>. In 1603, an average quality "<a href="sarong">sarong</a>"-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg. Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a> and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Coarser "ikat" from the Lesser Sundas was traded for <a href="sago">sago</a> from the <a href="Kei%20Islands">Kei Islands</a>, <a href="Aru%20Islands">Aru</a> and <a href="Seram">Seram</a>.

In August 1511 on behalf of the king of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, <a href="Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque">Afonso de Albuquerque</a> conquered <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a>, which at the time was the hub of Asian trade. In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Abreu">António de Abreu</a> to find them. <a href="Malay%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malay</a> pilots, either recruited or forcibly conscripted, guided them via <a href="Java">Java</a>, the <a href="Lesser%20Sundas">Lesser Sundas</a> and <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a> to Banda, arriving in early 1512. The first Europeans to reach the Bandas, the expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with Banda's nutmeg and mace, and with <a href="clove">clove</a>s in which Banda had a thriving entrepôt trade. D'Abreu sailed through <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a> and <a href="Seram%20Island">Seram</a> while his second in command <a href="Francisco%20Serr%C3%A3o">Francisco Serrão</a> went ahead towards the Maluku islands, was shipwrecked and ended up in <a href="Ternate">Ternate</a>. Distracted by hostilities elsewhere in the archipelago, such as Ambon and Ternate, the Portuguese did not return until 1529; a Portuguese trader Captain Garcia Henriques landed troops in the Bandas. Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were, however, hostile to such a plan, and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort. From then on, the Portuguese were infrequent visitors to the islands preferring to buy their nutmeg from traders in Malacca.

Unlike other eastern Indonesian islands, such as <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a>, <a href="Solor">Solor</a>, <a href="Ternate">Ternate</a> and <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, the Bandanese displayed no enthusiasm for Christianity or the Europeans who brought it in the sixteenth century, and no serious attempt was made to Christianise the Bandanese. Maintaining their independence, the Bandanese never allowed the Portuguese to build a fort or a permanent post in the islands. Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.

The Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland’s first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch—heavy woolens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example—were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The <a href="Javanese%20people">Javanese</a>, <a href="Arab">Arab</a> and <a href="India">India</a>n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along with steel knives, copper, medicines and prized <a href="China">Chinese</a> <a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>.

As much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that in trade with the East Indies, competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the "Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)" (the ‘<a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20Company">Dutch East Indies Company</a>) in 1602.

Until the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the "orang kaya" (literally 'rich men'); each of these was head of a district. At the time nutmeg was one of the "fine spices" kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian <a href="Fernand%20Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a> notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe. A number of Banda’s "orang kaya" were persuaded by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly.

In April 1609, Admiral <a href="Pieter%20Willemsz.%20Verhoeff">Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff</a> arrived at Banda Neira with a request by <a href="Maurice%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">Maurice, Prince of Orange</a> to build a fort on the island (the eventual <a href="Fort%20Nassau%2C%20Banda%20Islands">Fort Nassau</a>). The Bandanese were not excited about this idea. On May 22, before building of the fort had started, the "orang kaya" called a meeting with the Dutch admiral, purportedly to negotiate prices. Instead, they led Verhoeff and two high-ranked men into an ambush and decapitated them and subsequently killed 46 of the Dutch visitors. <a href="Jan%20Pietersz%20Coen">Jan Pietersz Coen</a>, who was a lower-ranked merchant on the expedition, managed to escape, but the traumatic event likely influenced his future attitude towards the Bandanese.

While Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and <a href="Run%20%28island%29">Run</a> islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the British paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Anglo-Dutch tensions increased in 1611 the Dutch built the larger and more strategic <a href="Fort%20Belgica">Fort Belgica</a> above Fort Nassau.

In 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men whereupon the English retreated to Run where they regrouped. Japanese mercenaries served in the Dutch forces. That same night, the English launched a surprise counter-attack on Ai, retaking the island and killing 200 Dutchmen. A year later, a much stronger Dutch force attacked Ai. This time the defenders were able to hold off the attack with cannon fire, but after a month of siege they ran out of ammunition. The Dutch slaughtered the defenders, and afterwards strengthened the fort, renaming it 'Fort Revenge'.

Newly appointed VOC governor-general <a href="Jan%20Pieterszoon%20Coen">Jan Pieterszoon Coen</a> set about enforcing Dutch monopoly over the Banda’s spice trade. In 1621 well-armed soldiers were landed on Bandaneira Island and within a few days they had also occupied neighbouring and larger <a href="Lontar%20island">Lontar</a>. The "orang kaya" were forced at gunpoint to sign an unfeasibly arduous treaty, one that was in fact impossible to keep, thus providing Coen an excuse to use superior Dutch force against the Bandanese. The Dutch quickly noted a number of alleged violations of the new treaty, in response to which Coen launched a punitive massacre. Japanese mercenaries were hired to deal with the "orang kaya", forty of whom were beheaded with their heads impaled and displayed on bamboo spears. The butchering and beheadings were carried out by the Japanese for the Dutch.

The islanders were also tortured by the Dutch. The Bandanese chiefs were tortured by the Dutch and Japanese.

The Dutch carved 68 parcels out of the islands after the enslavement and slaughter of the natives.

The population of the Banda Islands prior to Dutch conquest is generally estimated to have been around 13,000–15,000 people, some of whom were Malay and Javanese traders, as well as Chinese and Arabs. The actual numbers of Bandanese who were killed, forcibly expelled or fled the islands in 1621 remain uncertain. But readings of historical sources suggest around one thousand Bandanese likely survived in the islands, and were spread throughout the nutmeg groves as forced labourers. The Dutch subsequently re-settled the islands with imported slaves, convicts and indentured labourers (to work the nutmeg plantations), as well as immigrants from elsewhere in Indonesia. Most survivors fled as refugees to the islands of their trading partners, in particular <a href="Keffing">Keffing</a> and <a href="Guli%20Guli">Guli Guli</a> in the <a href="Seram">Seram Laut</a> chain and <a href="Kei%20Islands">Kei Besar</a>. Shipments of surviving Bandanese were also sent to Batavia (<a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) to work as slaves in developing the city and its fortress. Some 530 of these individuals were later returned to the islands because of their much-needed expertise in nutmeg cultivation (something sorely lacking among newly arrived Dutch settlers).

Whereas up until this point the Dutch presence had been simply as traders, that was sometimes treaty-based, the Banda conquest marked the start of the first overt colonial rule in Indonesia, albeit under the auspices of the VOC.

Having nearly eradicated the islands' native population, Coen divided the productive land of approximately half a million nutmeg trees into sixty-eight 1.2-hectare "perken". These land parcels were then handed to Dutch planters known as "perkeniers" of which 34 were on <a href="Lontar%20island">Lontar</a>, 31 on Ai and 3 on Neira. With few Bandanese left to work them, slaves from elsewhere were brought in. Now enjoying control of the nutmeg production, the VOC paid the "perkeniers" 1/122nd of the Dutch market price for nutmeg; however, the "perkeniers" still profited immensely building substantial villas with opulent imported European decorations.

The outlying island of Run was harder for the VOC to control and they exterminated all nutmeg trees there. The production and export of nutmeg was a VOC monopoly for almost two hundred years. <a href="Fort%20Belgica">Fort Belgica</a>, one of many forts built by the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, is one of the largest remaining European forts in Indonesia.

Though not physically present at the Banda Islands, the English claimed the small island of <a href="Run%20%28island%29">Run</a> until 1667 when, under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Breda%20%281667%29">Treaty of Breda (1667)</a>, the Dutch and English agreed to maintain the colonial <a href="status%20quo">status quo</a> and relinquish their respective claims.

In 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was a vassal of Napoleonic France and hence in conflict with Britain. The French and British were each seeking to control lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes. On 10 May 1810, a squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate "<a href="HMS%20Caroline">HMS Caroline</a>", formerly French frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20Pi%C3%A9montaise%20%281804%29">HMS Piedmontaise</a>", 18-gun <a href="Cruizer%20class%20brig-sloop">sloop</a> "<a href="HMS%20Barracouta">HMS Barracouta</a>", and the 12-gun transport "<a href="HMS%20Mandarin%20%281810%29">HMS Mandarin</a>" left <a href="Chennai">Madras</a> with money, supplies and troops to support the garrison at <a href="Ambon%20Island">Amboyna</a>, recently captured from the Dutch. The frigates and sloop carried a hundred officers and men of the <a href="102nd%20Regiment%20of%20Foot%20%28Royal%20Madras%20Fusiliers%29">Madras European Regiment</a>, while the "Mandarin" carried supplies. The squadron was commanded by Captain <a href="Christopher%20Cole%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Christopher Cole</a>, with Captain Charles Foote on the "Piedmontaise" and Captain Richard Kenah aboard the "Barracouta". After departing from Madras, Cole informed Foote and Kenah of Cole's plan to capture the Bandas; Foote and Kenah agreed. In Singapore, Captain <a href="Richard%20Spencer%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Spencer</a> informed Cole that over 700 regular Dutch troops may be located in the Bandas.

The squadron took a circuitous route to avoid alerting the Dutch. On 9 August 1810, the British appeared at <a href="Banda%20Neira">Banda Neira</a>. They quickly stormed the island and attacked <a href="Fort%20Belgica">Belgica Castle</a> at sunrise. The battle was over within hours, with the Dutch surrendering <a href="Fort%20Nassau%2C%20Banda%20Islands">Fort Nassau</a> – after some subterfuge – and within days the remainder of the Banda Islands. After the Dutch surrender, Captain Charles Foote (of the "Piedmontaise") was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Banda Islands. This action was a prelude to Britain's <a href="Invasion%20of%20Java%20%281811%29">invasion of Java</a> in 1811.

Before the Dutch retook control of the islands, the British removed many nutmeg trees and transplanted them to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a> and other British colonies. The competition largely destroyed the value of the Banda Islands to the Dutch.

In the late 1990s, violence between Christians and Muslims and between indigenous locals and <a href="Transmigration%20program">transmigrants</a> spilled over from <a href="Maluku%20sectarian%20conflict">intercommunal conflict</a> in Ambon. The disturbance and resulting deaths damaged the previously prosperous <a href="tourism">tourism</a> industry.

There are seven inhabited islands and several that are uninhabited. The inhabited islands are:

Others, possibly small and/or uninhabited, are:

The islands are part of the <a href="Banda%20Sea%20Islands%20moist%20deciduous%20forests">Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests</a> <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>.

Most of the present-day inhabitants of the Banda Islands are descended from migrants and plantation labourers from various parts of Indonesia, as well as from indigenous Bandanese. They have inherited aspects of pre-colonial ritual practices in the Bandas that are highly valued and still performed, giving them a distinct and very local cultural identity.

In addition, Bandanese speak a distinct dialect of <a href="Malay%20language">Malay language</a> which has several features distinguishing it from <a href="Ambonese%20Malay">Ambonese Malay</a>, the better-known and more widespread dialect that forms a lingua franca in central and southeast Maluku. Bandanese Malay is famous in the region for its unique, lilting accent, but it also has a number of locally identifying words in its lexicon, many of them borrowings or <a href="loanwords">loanwords</a> from <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>.

Examples :

Banda Malay shares many <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> loanwords with Ambonese Malay not appearing in the national language, <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a>. But it has comparatively fewer, and they differ in pronunciation.

Examples :

Finally, and most noticeably, Banda Malay uses some distinct pronouns. The most immediately distinguishing is that of the second person singular familiar form of address: pané.

The descendants of some of the Bandanese who fled Dutch conquest in the seventeenth century live in the <a href="Kai%20Islands">Kai Islands</a> (Kepulauan Kei) to the east of the Banda group, where a version of the original <a href="Banda%20language%20%28Indonesia%29">Banda language</a> is still spoken in the villages of Banda Eli and Banda Elat on Kai Besar Island. While long integrated into Kei Island society, residents of these settlements continue to value the historical origins of their ancestors.

Brisbane Broncos

The Brisbane Broncos are an Australian professional <a href="rugby%20league%20football">rugby league football</a> club based in the city of <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, the capital of the state of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Founded in 1988, the Broncos play in Australia's elite competition, the <a href="National%20Rugby%20League">National Rugby League</a> (NRL) premiership. They have won five premierships, a Super League title and two <a href="World%20Club%20Challenge">World Club Challenge</a>s. The Broncos have achieved four <a href="minor%20premiership">minor premiership</a>s during their 29 years in competition, making them the League's most successful club over the past three decades. Until 2015 Brisbane had never been defeated in a <a href="grand%20final">grand final</a>, and between 1991 and 2009 they never failed to qualify for the finals. They are the most successful club since the National Rugby League began in 1998, winning a record three premierships in this era. They are also one of the most successful clubs in the history of rugby league, having won 63% of their games since their induction in 1988, second only to Melbourne Storm with 64%.

The club records the highest annual revenue out of all NRL clubs–$32.8m for the 2012 financial year–and is one of the most valuable clubs of any code in Australia, worth over $42 million. Along with financial competitiveness, the Broncos have been voted one of Australia's most popular and most watched football teams, and has one of the highest average attendances of any <a href="rugby%20football">rugby</a> club in the world; 33,337 in the <a href="NRL%202012">2012 NRL season</a>.

The club was founded in 1988 as part of the <a href="Winfield%20Cup">Winfield Cup</a>'s national expansion, becoming, along with the <a href="Gold%20Coast-Tweed%20Giants">Gold Coast-Tweed Giants</a>, one of Queensland's first two participants in the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League%20premiership">New South Wales Rugby League premiership</a>. The Broncos later became a dominant force in the competition before playing a significant role in the <a href="Super%20League%20War">Super League War</a> of the mid-1990s, then continuing to compete successfully in the reunified National Rugby League competition. The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of <a href="Red%20Hill%2C%20Queensland">Red Hill</a> where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at <a href="Milton%2C%20Queensland">Milton</a>'s <a href="Suncorp%20Stadium">Suncorp Stadium</a>. They are the only publicly listed sporting club on the <a href="Australian%20Securities%20Exchange">Australian Securities Exchange</a>, trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ().

Queensland's success in the 1980s, the early years of the <a href="State%20of%20Origin%20series">State of Origin series</a> between <a href="Queensland%20rugby%20league%20team">Queensland</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20rugby%20league%20team">New South Wales</a>, in addition to the inclusion of a combined <a href="Brisbane%20Rugby%20League">Brisbane Rugby League</a> team in the <a href="Amco%20Cup">mid-week competition</a>, convinced the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> (NSWRL) to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition. After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane licence, the <a href="Queensland%20Rugby%20League">Queensland Rugby League</a> chose the bid of former <a href="Brisbane%20Rugby%20League">Brisbane Rugby League</a> (BRL) players, <a href="Barry%20Maranta">Barry Maranta</a> and <a href="Paul%20Morgan%20%28rugby%20league%29">Paul "Porky" Morgan</a>.
The Broncos secured the services of <a href="Australian%20Kangaroos">Australian Kangaroos</a> captain <a href="Wally%20Lewis">Wally Lewis</a> and former <a href="Brisbane%20Rugby%20League">BRL</a> coach <a href="Wayne%20Bennett%20%28rugby%20league%29">Wayne Bennett</a>. The team made their debut in the NSWRL's <a href="1988%20Winfield%20Cup">1988 Winfield Cup</a> premiership against reigning premiers, the <a href="Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles">Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles</a>, and defeated them 44–10. However, after this promising start they failed to make the finals. In their <a href="1989%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season">second season</a> they won the mid-week knockout competition, the <a href="1989%20Panasonic%20Cup%20%28rugby%20league%29">1989 Panasonic Cup</a>. The club first tasted <a href="1992%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season%23Grand%20final">premiership success in 1992</a>, and <a href="1993%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season%23Grand%20final">again in 1993</a>, defeating the <a href="St.%20George%20Dragons">St. George Dragons</a> in both years.

In <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%201995">1995</a>, the <a href="Super%20League%20War">Super League War</a> broke out. After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Broncos were one of the last clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit (The Canberra Raiders, Canterbury Bulldogs and Cronulla Sharks were the first to sign, and it was only revealed many years later that the Broncos were in fact one of the last clubs to sign for either competition). Broncos CEO <a href="John%20Ribot">John Ribot</a> moved to take over the running of the rebel <a href="Super%20League%20%28Australia%29">Super League</a>, leading to a perception that the conflict was orchestrated by the club. Brisbane won the only <a href="Super%20League%20%28Australia%29%20season%201997">Super League premiership</a> in <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%201997">1997</a>, before winning the first National Rugby League trophy in the re-unified <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%201998">1998</a> competition.

<a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%201999">1999</a> was disappointing for the club with a terrible early-season form hindering their attempt at a third consecutive premiership losing 8 of their first 10 matches. Club legend <a href="Allan%20Langer">Allan Langer</a> retired mid-season, perhaps as a result of the team's form. Despite the club's mid-season turnaround, which resulted in qualification for the finals after an 11-match winning streak, the team was eliminated by the <a href="Cronulla%20Sharks">Cronulla Sharks</a> in the first week of the finals. However, the Broncos' rebounded in 2000 with their fifth premiership, defeating the <a href="Sydney%20Roosters">Sydney Roosters</a>. The game marked the retirement of veterans <a href="Kevin%20Walters">Kevin Walters</a> and <a href="Michael%20Hancock%20%28rugby%20league%29">Michael Hancock</a>.
Allan Langer returned to the club in <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%202002">2002</a> for one season before eventually retiring. 2002 was also the beginning of Brisbane's "post-Origin slump", which has haunted the club in the years since. Many players represent <a href="Queensland%20rugby%20league%20team">Queensland</a> in the <a href="State%20of%20Origin%20series">State of Origin series</a>, with 7 Broncos players on average included in the Queensland Origin team. This extra workload has caused a loss of form for the club immediately after the series, evidenced in 2003 when the ladder-leading Broncos lost 10 of their last 11 games. Despite faring better in <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%202004">2004</a> and <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%202005">2005</a>, the team still struggled in the latter stages of the season, losing all of their finals matches.

In <a href="Brisbane%20Broncos%202006">2006</a>, after a strong early and mid-season performance, the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 consecutive games. However, they reversed this run of form, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the <a href="2006%20NRL%20Grand%20Final">premiership decider</a> against the <a href="Melbourne%20Storm">Melbourne Storm</a> and keeping their perfect Grand Final record intact.

Their 2010 season started moderately: a 30–24 win against North Queensland, a 14–22 loss to Canberra, and a 48–16 hammering by the Warriors on 28 March 2010. On Monday 29 March, former Broncos player and recruitment agent Allan Langer was caught drink-driving in Brisbane's northside.

Apart from a late season 10–6 win against eventual premiers <a href="St.%20George%20Illawarra%20Dragons">St George Illawarra</a>, the 2010 season was one to forget; with injuries and poor form seeing the Broncos out of the finals for the first time since 1991. The Broncos missing the finals now means that every club has missed the finals at least once since the 2002 season.

In February 2011, it was announced that <a href="Ivan%20Henjak">Ivan Henjak</a> was to be sacked from the club, only three weeks before the beginning of the season. <a href="Anthony%20Griffin%20%28rugby%20league%29">Anthony Griffin</a> took over as coach for the 2011 season, becoming just the third head coach in the history of the Brisbane Broncos. He led the club to a third-place finish at the end of the season, losing to eventual premiers <a href="Manly-Warringah%20Sea%20Eagles">Manly</a> in the preliminary finals.

2012 marked the Broncos' 25th season in the NRL competition. They finished eighth on the premiership ladder, and were knocked out of the finals in the first week, losing 33–16 to the <a href="North%20Queensland%20Cowboys">North Queensland Cowboys</a> in Townsville. 2013 saw the Broncos finish 12th on the NRL ladder, marking its lowest ever finish in the club's history and seeing the club out of the finals for only the second time since 1991.

In what is considered by some commentators to be one of the best Grand Finals in recent history the 2015 Grand Final against the <a href="North%20Queensland%20Cowboys">North Queensland Cowboys</a> went in to <a href="Golden%20Point">Golden Point</a> overtime for the first time. <a href="Jonathan%20Thurston">Jonathan Thurston</a>, after missing a match winning <a href="Rugby%20league%20gameplay">try conversion</a> after the 80 minutes, kicked a field goal 2 minutes into the Golden Point period to win the match for the North Queensland Cowboys 17-16.

As of 2017, the Broncos are currently experiencing their longest premiership drought, having endured eleven completed seasons without winning the premiership since their most recent success in <a href="2006%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season">2006</a>.

It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a> and a stylised "Q" which had been featured in the logo for the Queensland Rugby League for many years. However, with the <a href="Australian%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Australian national rugby league team</a> also known as the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The state flower the <a href="Cooktown%20Orchid">Cooktown Orchid</a> and the <a href="Poinsettia">Poinsettia</a> which had long been used by Brisbane representative teams in the <a href="Bulimba%20Cup%20%28rugby%20league%20competition%29">Bulimba Cup</a> and midweek knockout competitions was also ruled out, along with other <a href="Fauna%20of%20Australia">Australian animals</a> such as the <a href="brumby">brumby</a>, <a href="Phalangeriformes">possum</a>, <a href="galah">galah</a> and the <a href="kookaburra">kookaburra</a>, which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen <a href="Paddle%20steamer">paddleships</a>.

The original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly gold colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more maroon design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general. This design continues to be used to date.

Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favoured the official blue and gold colours of <a href="Brisbane%20City%20Council">Brisbane City Council</a>. However, Sydney advertiser <a href="John%20Singleton%20%28Australian%20entrepreneur%29">John Singleton</a> advised the board that "Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century." As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Queensland along with gold, symbolising the Queensland sunshine,

In the inaugural <a href="1988%20Brisbane%20Broncos%20season">1988 season</a>, the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of <a href="Manly%20Sea%20Eagles">Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles</a> and the maroon of the <a href="Queensland%20rugby%20league%20team">Queensland rugby league team</a>. Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.

At the 1995 <a href="Rugby%20League%20World%20Sevens">Rugby League World Sevens</a> tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours – mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it "will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours." In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the <a href="Penrith%20Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a>, Melbourne Storm and <a href="New%20Zealand%20Warriors">New Zealand Warriors</a>. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.

In their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 32,500 capacity <a href="Lang%20Park">Lang Park</a>, the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with <a href="Castlemaine%20XXXX">Castlemaine XXXX</a> brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead sitting on the ground with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just happened to have prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity <a href="Queensland%20Sport%20and%20Athletics%20Centre">ANZ Stadium</a> in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the <a href="1982%20Commonwealth%20Games">1982 Commonwealth Games</a>). The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season. However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on <a href="The%20Mole%20%28Australia%20season%203%29%23Episode%208">an episode of "The Mole"</a> in April 2002.

With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park, the team moved back to the refurbished and renamed Suncorp Stadium upon its completion in mid-2003. The more centrally-located stadium has begun to attract larger crowds, with the 2006 average attendance of 31,208 being significantly higher than the <a href="Newcastle%20Knights">Newcastle Knights</a> with 21,848 and about double the regular season competition average of 15,601.

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the St. George Dragons in the final round of the 1993 season. The record attendance for a match at Suncorp Stadium is 50,859 for Darren Lockyer's final home game. Before kick-off at the Stadium an instrumental version of <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "<a href="Kashmir%20%28song%29">Kashmir</a>" is routinely played.

The Broncos all-time home attendance record was set at ANZ Stadium during the <a href="1997%20Super%20League%20%28Australia%29%20season%23Grand%20final">1997 Super League Grand Final</a> when 58,912 saw the Broncos defeat the <a href="Cronulla%20Sharks">Cronulla Sharks</a> 26-8 to claim the only <a href="Super%20League%20%28Australia%29">Super League</a> premiership played in Australia.

The Brisbane Broncos have the largest fan base of any NRL club and they have been voted the most popular rugby league team in Australia for several years. A Broncos <a href="supporters%20group">supporters group</a> called "The Thoroughbreds" which is made up of prominent businessmen, made an unsuccessful bid to purchase News Ltd's controlling share of the club in 2007.

The Broncos are the only publicly listed NRL club. The parent company of the Brisbane Broncos is Nationwide News Pty Ltd., a subsidiary of <a href="News%20Limited">News Limited</a>, which as of 30 June 2007, owns 68.87% of Broncos shares.

<a href="John%20Ribot">John Ribot</a>, a former first grade rugby league player in Queensland and New South Wales, was the club's original chief executive officer (CEO). Ribot left when he signed to become the CEO of the rebel Australian rugby league competition <a href="Super%20League%20%28Australia%29">Super League</a>. (p. 24,112) Shane Edwards, the Broncos Marketing Manager at the time, was promoted to CEO and later resigned. Bruno Cullen, who had been with the Broncos' off-field staff since 1989, became the club's third CEO in 2003.

<a href="NRMA%20Insurance">NRMA Insurance</a> are the major sponsors of the Broncos as of 2011, replacing <a href="WOW%20Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">WOW Sight & Sound</a>. <a href="Nova%20106.9">Nova 106.9</a> are the main radio sponsors after taking over from rival station <a href="B105%20FM">B105 FM</a> in late 2006. Live broadcasts of all Broncos matches are provided by both <a href="612%20ABC%20Brisbane">612 ABC Brisbane</a> (except games played on Monday Night) and <a href="4MMM">4MMM</a>. <a href="QTQ">Channel Nine Queensland</a> also sponsors the Broncos, although former player <a href="Shane%20Webcke">Shane Webcke</a> is signed to rival <a href="BTQ">Seven Queensland</a>.

In 2012, local Brisbane based company Firstmac Home Loans replaced WOW sight & Sound as sleeve sponsor for 3 years to launch into the retail financial services market. This sponsorship took only 9 days to negotiate following the announcement of WOW Sight & Sound going into receivership. Firstmac stipulated a unique clause in their contract that they could pay for 250 tickets to be distributed to WOW Sight & Sound staff that lost their jobs. Firstmac has since launched a Firstmac Broncos home loan in conjunction with their new sponsorship agreement.

Between 1997 and 2016, the club's apparel was manufactured by <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>. From the 2017 season, <a href="International%20Sports%20Clothing">International Sports Clothing</a> has replaced Nike as the club's apparel manufacturer.

Due to the club's premiership success and its being the dominant Queensland team in the competition for the majority of its participation, the Brisbane Broncos' list of representative players is extensive. Consequently, there have been a large number of Queensland Maroons in the team. In 2007, a 20-man legends team was announced to celebrate the club's 20-year anniversary.

The Brisbane Broncos are the second most successful club in terms of percentage of total games won, having won 63.63% of their games, as of 29 August 2012. This is marginally less (0.01%) than first placed <a href="Melbourne%20Storm">Melbourne Storm</a>. In their twenty completed seasons, the club has made a total of seven Grand Finals, winning 6 and losing 1 to the North Qld Cowboys in 2015. They are one of only two clubs to have won the <a href="World%20Club%20Challenge">World Club Challenge</a> twice, and were the first club to do so on British soil. They also won the now defunct <a href="Amco%20Cup">Panasonic Cup</a> in <a href="1989%20Panasonic%20Cup%20%28rugby%20league%29">1989</a>.

Former team captain Darren Lockyer holds the record for the most First Grade games for both the club and National League. Lockyer did also hold the record for the most points scored for the club, tallying 1,171 since his debut in 1995, until Corey Parker overtook him in August, 2015. Darren Lockyer also holds the club record of 272 points in a season, having achieved this in 1998. <a href="Steve%20Renouf">Steve Renouf</a> holds the record for the most career tries for the club with 142. Renouf also shares the club record for the most number of tries in a season with <a href="Darren%20Smith%20%28rugby%20league%29">Darren Smith</a> at 23. <a href="Lote%20Tuqiri">Lote Tuqiri</a>'s tally of 26 points from three tries and seven goals in a single match against the <a href="Northern%20Eagles">Northern Eagles</a> remains the club record for most individual points in a game. <a href="Corey%20Parker%20%28rugby%20league%29">Corey Parker</a> holds the record for most goals in a game kicking ten in a round one clash of 2008, breaking the previous mark of nine kicked by Lockyer in 1998 and matched by <a href="Michael%20De%20Vere">Michael De Vere</a> in 2001. Parker converted ten from ten goals in the Broncos 48–12 win over the <a href="Penrith%20Panthers">Penrith Panthers</a> in which Parker scored 24 points placing him in equal second place on the most points in a match tally. Six players have scored four tries in a match for the Brisbane Broncos including <a href="Steve%20Renouf">Steve Renouf</a>, <a href="Wendell%20Sailor">Wendell Sailor</a>, <a href="Karmichael%20Hunt">Karmichael Hunt</a>, <a href="Justin%20Hodges">Justin Hodges</a>, <a href="Denan%20Kemp">Denan Kemp</a> and <a href="Israel%20Folau">Israel Folau</a>. Renouf achieved this feat five times from 1991 to 1998.

The club's biggest winning margin is 65 points, achieved in 2007 in a 71–6 victory over the <a href="Newcastle%20Knights">Newcastle Knights</a>. Their heaviest defeat is a 56–0 loss by the Canberra Raiders on 1 August 2009.

The Paul Morgan Medal is awarded annually to the Brisbane Broncos' player of the year. it is named after one of the club's founders, <a href="Paul%20Morgan%20%28rugby%20league%29">Paul 'Porky' Morgan</a>.

Brisbane Lions

The Brisbane Lions is a professional <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> club which plays in the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL). The club is based in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Queensland, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The club was formed in 1996 from the merger of the <a href="Fitzroy%20Football%20Club">Fitzroy Lions</a> and the <a href="Brisbane%20Bears">Brisbane Bears</a>. The Lions are one of the most successful AFL clubs of the 21st century, having appeared in four consecutive <a href="AFL%20Grand%20Final">AFL Grand Final</a>s from <a href="2001%20AFL%20season">2001</a> to <a href="2004%20AFL%20season">2004</a> and winning three premierships (2001, 2002, 2003).

The club is based at <a href="the%20Gabba">the Gabba</a>. The team is captained by <a href="Dayne%20Beams">Dayne Beams</a> and coached by <a href="Chris%20Fagan%20%28Australian%20footballer%29">Chris Fagan</a>.

The Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997.

In their first year as a combined club the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the <a href="St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club">St Kilda Football Club</a> in a qualifying final. The following year, however, they finished in last position, despite boasting a talented playing list.

As the Brisbane Lions, the club won its first AFL premiership in the <a href="2001%20AFL%20Grand%20Final">2001 AFL Grand Final</a>, defeating <a href="Essendon%20Football%20Club">Essendon</a> 15.18 (108) to 12.10 (82). Lions utility player <a href="Shaun%20Hart">Shaun Hart</a> won the <a href="Norm%20Smith%20Medal">Norm Smith Medal</a> as best on ground in the <a href="AFL%20Grand%20Final">Grand Final</a>.

In 2002, the Lions won back-to-back premierships when they again defeated <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood</a> 9.12 (66) to 10.15 (75) in the <a href="2002%20AFL%20Grand%20Final">2002 AFL Grand Final</a> in cold and wet conditions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already had nine possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench.

With a number of players under an injury cloud – and having lost to Collingwood in a qualifying final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground three weeks previously – the Lions went into the game as underdogs. However, they sealed their place in history as an AFL dynasty by thrashing the Magpies in cool but sunny conditions. At one stage in the final quarter the Lions led by almost 80 points before relaxing when the match was well and truly won, allowing Collingwood to score the last four goals. The final score of 20.14 (134) to 12.12 (84) saw the club become only the fourth in VFL/AFL history to win three consecutive premierships and the first since the creation of the AFL. Simon Black claimed the Norm Smith Medal with a dominant 39 possession match, the most possessions ever gathered by a player in a grand final.

The 2004 season saw Brisbane remain in the top portion of the ladder for most of the season. Reaching the finals in second position, Brisbane controversially had to travel to Melbourne to play against <a href="Geelong%20Football%20Club">Geelong</a> in the preliminary final, due to a contract between the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG) and the <a href="Australian%20Football%20League">Australian Football League</a> (AFL) that required one preliminary final to be played each year at the MCG. <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide</a> had finished on top of the ladder and hosted the other preliminary final in Adelaide. Despite this setback, Brisbane beat Geelong and reached the <a href="AFL%20Grand%20Final">AFL Grand Final</a> for the fourth consecutive year. Their opponents, Port Adelaide, playing in their first ever grand final, were too good on the day and recorded a 40-point win.

The Lions began the <a href="2006%20AFL%20Season">2006 season</a> optimistically, but injuries again plagued the club, whose players recorded an AFL record total of 200 matches lost to injury for the season.

The Brisbane Lions finished runner up in the 2007 <a href="Australian%20Football%20League%20pre-season%20competition">NAB Cup</a> and then went on to create history by being the first team in the history of the AFL to have five co-captains. That year, the Lions failed to make the finals for a third successive year in 2007.

The Lions began the <a href="2008%20NAB%20Cup">2008 NAB Cup</a> shakily, losing to Essendon by 27 points. The team struggled for the season and missed out on the finals with a 10–12 record, losing 3 games despite having at least 5 more scoring shots in each of those games. Coach Leigh Matthews resigned at the end of the season after 10 seasons and 3 premierships with the club.

The Lions made a good start in the <a href="2009%20NAB%20Cup">2009 NAB Cup</a> under new senior coach Michael Voss by registering a 9-point win over <a href="St%20Kilda%20Football%20Club">St Kilda</a>. However this was followed by a series of losses in the pre-season to <a href="Essendon%20Football%20Club">Essendon</a>, <a href="Melbourne%20Football%20Club">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Richmond%20Football%20Club">Richmond</a>. Their season ended with a 51-point loss to the <a href="Western%20Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a>.

The 2009/2010 off-season was dominated by the arrival of <a href="Brendan%20Fevola">Brendan Fevola</a> from Carlton, and the hype was focused on Fevola and Jonathan Brown in the sense that the Lions could capitalise on their strong 2009 season. Indeed, the Lions won their first four matches of the 2010 season to be top of the ladder after four rounds, but they would only win three more games after that to crash to a lowly finish by season's end. One of those wins however, was against eventual premiers .

The Lions' 2010/2011 off-season was disrupted by the sacking of Fevola after just one season at the Lions, following repeated off-field indiscretions which included getting drunk in the Brisbane streets during New Year's Eve celebrations. On the field, the Lions won only four games for the year, but only one against any Victorian team, and that was , in Round 9. Despite their worst season since 1998, coach <a href="Michael%20Voss">Michael Voss</a> was granted a contract extension after the board recommended that Voss was the best man to take the club forward into the future. Leading into season 2012, only two players from the triple-premiership winning team of 2001–2003 remained: <a href="Simon%20Black">Simon Black</a> and <a href="Jonathan%20Brown%20%28Australian%20footballer%29">Jonathan Brown</a>.

The 2013 season started well for Brisbane, defeating <a href="Carlton%20Football%20Club">Carlton</a> in the final of the <a href="NAB%20Cup">NAB Cup</a>, with <a href="Daniel%20Rich">Daniel Rich</a> winning the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground and <a href="Aaron%20Cornelius">Aaron Cornelius</a> showing some good form. However, things began to decline from then, with losses to the <a href="Western%20Bulldogs">Western Bulldogs</a> and <a href="Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Adelaide</a>. However, in the 5th <a href="QClash">QClash</a> match against <a href="Gold%20Coast%20Suns">Gold Coast</a>, the Lions won by two points, with <a href="Jonathan%20Brown%20%28Australian%20footballer%29">Jonathan Brown</a> winning the Marcus Ashcroft Medal. Injuries were beginning to take a toll, with young players <a href="Claye%20Beams">Claye Beams</a> and <a href="Jared%20Polec">Jared Polec</a> suffering severe injuries. In Round 13, Brisbane defeated second-placed <a href="Geelong%20Football%20Club">Geelong</a>, coming from 52 points down late in the third quarter to win by 5 points due to an <a href="Ash%20McGrath">Ash McGrath</a> <a href="After%20the%20siren%20kicks%20in%20Australian%20rules%20football">goal after the siren</a> in his 200th match.

On 13 August 2013, coach Michael Voss was told that his contract would not be renewed.

On 25 August 2013, former premiership player of the Lions, <a href="Justin%20Leppitsch">Justin Leppitsch</a>, was confirmed to be the senior coach of the Lions for the next 3 seasons starting in 2014

On 18 October 2013, Brisbane Lions legend Simon Black announced his retirement.

During round 13, 2014 Lions captain Jonathan Brown was the victim of a facial injury in a clash between the Lions and the Greater Western Sydney Giants. He collided with Tomas Bugg's knee and was taken off the ground. He suffered a concussion, which caused his retirement from football. Along with the retirement of <a href="Ashley%20McGrath">Ashley McGrath</a> in August 2014, no active players remain from any of the club's triple-premiership winning sides.

On 29 August 2016, Leppitsch was sacked as coach of the Lions.

On 4 October 2016, Chris Fagan was announced as the Lions' coach from the 2017 season onwards.

Crowds and memberships for the Brisbane Lions grew dramatically during the four seasons in which they made the AFL Grand Final. Since then, with the team being less successful, attendances have declined, but have remained stable over the past three seasons. In 2009 the Lions found it so difficult to sell corporate boxes that they resorted to doing so on a game-by-game basis. 2011 saw the Brisbane Lions suffer their worst ever drop in support, as memberships decreased by 28%. 2017 memberships are the lowest the club has had since 2012.

In 1997 the club unveiled its new merger emblem it would consist of the iconic golden Fitzroy Lion on a badge (which was the style in the AFL at the time) of Maroon and Blue. The club used this from 1997 to the end of 2001 after their first premiership. In 2002 the club would unveil a new emblem in the shape of a football with the words "Brisbane Lions" in the middle with the golden Lion placed inside the O of Lion. The club continued the use of this emblem until the 2010 season when they changed the entire emblem dropping the golden Lion and replaced it with a cartoonish style Lions head. The club also removed the golden Lion from the team guernseys and introduced the new emblem on the body of the original Lion. The change was met with much backlash as many supporters dubbed the new emblem the "Paddle Pop Lion" after the popular ice cream of the same name. In 2014 after overwhelming response from the supporters the club dropped the new emblem from their guernseys and reintroduced the classic golden Lion which they wore from 1997 until 2010. Though the club has kept the current emblem for all club related advertising and marketing.

The three types of guernsey are:


As of 2016 the lions new mascot 'Roy' was introduced.
The Lion's <a href="Mascot%20Manor">Mascot Manor</a> representative and club mascot is Bernie "Gabba" Vegas, a caricature of a lion dressed in Brisbane Lions jumper, sunglasses, wide lapels, and flares, designed to resemble <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>.

The club's team song, "The Pride of Brisbane Town", is based on the Fitzroy club song, and is sung to the music of "<a href="La%20Marseillaise">La Marseillaise</a>", the French national anthem:

<poem>We are the pride of Brisbane town,
we wear maroon, blue and gold,
we will always fight for victory,
like Fitzroy and Bears of old,
all for one, and one for all,
we will answer to the call,
go Lions, Brisbane Lions,
we'll kick the winning score,
you'll hear our mighty roar!</poem>

The Brisbane Lions have three main rivals, <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood</a>, <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide</a> and <a href="Gold%20Coast%20Football%20Club">Gold Coast</a>.

The biggest rival for the Lions is <a href="Collingwood%20Football%20Club">Collingwood</a>, having built up plenty of history in the relatively short existence as a merged club. Pre-merger <a href="Fitzroy%20Football%20Club">Fitzroy</a> was a neighbouring suburb to Collingwood, with the boundary being based on Smith Street, along with the fact that Fitzroy and Collingwood topped the VFL/AFL premiership tally during the early decades of the VFL competition. The <a href="Brisbane%20Bears">Brisbane Bears</a> also had a bit of history with the Magpies as <a href="Nathan%20Buckley">Nathan Buckley</a> famously deflected to Collingwood after one season on the Bears list, citing that he wanted to win premierships, ironically retiring at the end of the 2007 season without a premiership as a player in the AFL. The Bears also lost their final regular season match in their final season to the Magpies, costing the Bears the minor premiership that season. However the rivalry between the Lions and the Magpies has been properly ignited post-merger, starting in late 1999 when Collingwood played their last ever VFL/AFL game at their spiritual home ground, <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Melbourne">Victoria Park</a> with the Lions emerging 42 point victors that day and consigning the Magpies to their second wooden spoon, to the dissatisfaction of the Collingwood supporters. The rivalry between the two clubs went to the next level as the clubs played off in two consecutive Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003, with the Lions emerging victors on both occasions. These grand final results further fueled the bitterness that Collingwood supporters and their president <a href="Eddie%20McGuire">Eddie McGuire</a> still have towards the Brisbane Lions to this day, despite the Lions having a poor decade on the field after their golden era. Due to many Collingwood supporters migrating up to Queensland and many Brisbane Lions supporters residing in Victoria (many of which were ex-Fitzroy supporters), along with the on-field history between the two clubs, many Lions supporters consider a Brisbane Lions v Collingwood match-up to be their derby, despite the clubs being over 1700 km apart and the fact that there are many clubs in the competition that are geographically closer to each other.

The third biggest rival of the Lions is <a href="Port%20Adelaide%20Football%20Club">Port Adelaide</a>, with the Brisbane Bears and Fitzroy merging to become the Brisbane Lions in order to allow Port Adelaide to enter the AFL competition. This created some dissatisfaction between old Bears and Fitzroy supporters who have felt that they have lost their clubs. In their first season in the AFL, the Lions narrowly made the finals at the expense of Port Adelaide, with the Power narrowly missing out on percentage. However the rivalry was properly ignited during the early 2000s, as both clubs fielded strong teams during that period. In 2001 the Lions defeated the Power in the Qualifying final en route to their first of three consecutive premierships, with Port bowing out in straight sets that year. In 2002 Port defeated Brisbane by 6 points in the final regular season game to narrowly claim the minor premiership, however Brisbane would eliminate Port in the Preliminary Final that year to claim their second premiership out of their hat-trick of premierships. In 2003 Port would claim their second consecutive minor premiership, however they would go on to lose their qualifying and preliminary finals again, as the Lions would claim their hat-trick of premierships that season. However, in 2004 Port Adelaide would finally break through and win their first AFL premiership, defeating the Brisbane Lions in the Grand Final and preventing them from what would have been a historic four premierships in a row. In adding further insult to injury for Lions fans, it meant that their biggest rivals, Collingwood, would remain the only team in the VFL/AFL to win four-in-a-row. The rivalry between the two clubs has cooled down since the early 2000s, however, there are a few Lions supporters that still consider Port Adelaide to be a bigger rival than Collingwood.

The introduction of the Gold Coast Suns into the competition in <a href="2011%20AFL%20Season">2011</a> saw a rivalry within Queensland Football for the first time ever. The Lions and Suns play each other two times a year. The best player on the ground is awarded the Marcus Ashcroft Medal. Gold Coast won the first Q Clash by 8 points in Round 7, 2011.

Bloody Sunday (1972)

Bloody Sunday – sometimes called the Bogside Massacre – was an incident on 30 January 1972 in the <a href="Bogside">Bogside</a> area of <a href="Derry">Derry</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, when <a href="British%20Army">British soldiers</a> shot 28 unarmed civilians during a peaceful protest march against <a href="Operation%20Demetrius">internment</a>. Fourteen people died: thirteen were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers and some were shot while trying to help the wounded. Other protesters were injured by <a href="rubber%20bullet">rubber bullet</a>s or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles. The march had been organised by the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Civil%20Rights%20Association">Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association</a> (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a>, also known as "1 Para".

Two investigations have been held by the <a href="British%20government">British government</a>. The <a href="Widgery%20Tribunal">Widgery Tribunal</a>, held in the immediate aftermath of the incident, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. It described the soldiers' shooting as "bordering on the reckless", but accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. The report was widely criticised as a "<a href="whitewash%20%28censorship%29">whitewash</a>". The <a href="Saville%20Inquiry">Saville Inquiry</a>, chaired by <a href="Mark%20Saville%2C%20Baron%20Saville%20of%20Newdigate">Lord Saville of Newdigate</a>, was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the incident. Following a 12-year inquiry, Saville's report was made public in 2010 and concluded that the killings were both "unjustified" and "unjustifiable". It found that all of those shot were unarmed, that none were posing a serious threat, that no bombs were thrown, and that soldiers "knowingly put forward false accounts" to justify their firing. On the publication of the report, British prime minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> made a formal apology on behalf of the United Kingdom. Following this, police began a murder investigation into the killings.

Bloody Sunday was one of the most significant events of "<a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a>" because a large number of civilian citizens were killed, by forces of the state, in full view of the public and the press. It was the highest number of people killed in a single shooting incident during the conflict. Bloody Sunday increased <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Catholic</a> and <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalist</a> hostility towards the British Army and exacerbated the conflict. Support for the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) rose and there was a surge of recruitment into the organisation, especially locally.

The City of Londonderry was perceived by many Catholics and <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalists</a> in Northern Ireland to be the epitome of what was described as "fifty years of Unionist misrule": despite having a nationalist majority, <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> ensured elections to the City Corporation always returned a <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a> majority. At the same time the city was perceived to be deprived of public investment – rail routes to the city were closed, motorways were not extended to it, a university was opened in the relatively small (Protestant-majority) town of <a href="Coleraine">Coleraine</a> rather than Derry and, above all, the city's housing stock was in an appalling state. The city therefore became a significant focus of the civil rights campaign led by organisations such as <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Civil%20Rights%20Association">Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association</a> (NICRA) in the late 1960s and it was in Derry that the so-called <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bogside">Battle of the Bogside</a> – the event that more than any other pushed the Northern Ireland administration to ask for military support for civil policing – took place in August 1969.

While many Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a neutral force, in contrast to what was regarded as a sectarian police force, relations between them soon deteriorated.

In response to escalating levels of violence across Northern Ireland, <a href="Operation%20Demetrius">internment without trial</a> was introduced on 9 August 1971. There was disorder across Northern Ireland following the introduction of internment, with 21 people being killed in three days of rioting. In Belfast, soldiers of the <a href="Parachute%20Regiment%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Parachute Regiment</a> shot dead 11 Catholic civilians in what became known as the <a href="Ballymurphy%20Massacre">Ballymurphy Massacre</a>. On 10 August, <a href="Bombardier%20%28rank%29">Bombardier</a> Paul Challenor became the first soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA in Derry, when he was shot by a sniper on the <a href="Creggan%2C%20Derry">Creggan estate</a>. A further six soldiers had been killed in Derry by mid-December 1971. At least 1,332 rounds were fired at the British Army, who also faced 211 explosions and 180 <a href="nail%20bomb">nail bomb</a>s, and who fired 364 rounds in return.

IRA activity also increased across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being killed in the remaining months of 1971, in contrast to the ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year. Both the <a href="Official%20IRA">Official IRA</a> and Provisional IRA had established <a href="no-go%20area">no-go area</a>s for the British Army and <a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC) in Derry through the use of barricades. By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as <a href="Free%20Derry">Free Derry</a>, 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as "aggro corner". Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by <a href="incendiary%20device">incendiary device</a>s, an estimated total of worth of damage had been done to local businesses.

On 18 January 1972 <a href="Brian%20Faulkner">Brian Faulkner</a>, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Prime Minister of Northern Ireland</a>, banned all parades and marches in Northern Ireland until the end of the year.

On 22 January 1972, a week before Bloody Sunday, an anti-internment march was held at <a href="Magilligan">Magilligan</a> strand, near Derry. The protesters marched to a new internment camp there, but were stopped by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment. When some protesters threw stones and tried to go around the barbed wire, paratroopers drove them back by firing <a href="rubber%20bullet">rubber bullet</a>s at close range and making <a href="baton%20charge">baton charge</a>s. The paratroopers badly beat a number of protesters and had to be physically restrained by their own officers. These allegations of brutality by paratroopers were reported widely on television and in the press. Some in the Army also thought there had been undue violence by the paratroopers.

NICRA intended, despite the ban, to hold another anti-internment march in Derry on Sunday 30 January. The authorities decided to allow it to proceed in the Catholic areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching <a href="Guildhall%2C%20Derry">Guildhall Square</a>, as planned by the organisers. The authorities expected that this would lead to rioting. Major General <a href="Robert%20Ford%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Ford</a>, then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (1 Para), should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters. The arrest operation was codenamed 'Operation Forecast'. The Saville Report criticised General Ford for choosing the Parachute Regiment for the operation, as it had "a reputation for using excessive physical violence". The paratroopers arrived in Derry on the morning of the march and took up positions in the city. Brigadier Pat MacLellan was the operational commander and issued orders from <a href="Ebrington%20Barracks">Ebrington Barracks</a>. He gave orders to Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Derek%20Wilford">Derek Wilford</a>, commander of 1 Para. He in turn gave orders to Major <a href="Ted%20Loden">Ted Loden</a>, who commanded the <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> who launched the arrest operation.

The protesters planned on marching from Bishop's Field, in the Creggan housing estate, to the Guildhall, in the city centre, where they would hold a rally. The march set off at about 2:45pm. There were 10–15,000 people on the march, with many joining along its route. <a href="John%20Widgery%2C%20Baron%20Widgery">Lord Widgery</a>, in his now discredited tribunal, said that there were only 3,000 to 5,000.

The march made its way along William Street but, as it neared the city centre, its path was blocked by British Army barriers. The organisers redirected the march down Rossville Street, intending to hold the rally at <a href="Free%20Derry%20Corner">Free Derry Corner</a> instead. However, some broke off from the march and began throwing stones at soldiers manning the barriers. The soldiers fired <a href="rubber%20bullet">rubber bullet</a>s, <a href="CS%20gas">CS gas</a> and <a href="water%20cannon">water cannon</a> to try to disperse the rioters. Such clashes between soldiers and youths were common, and observers reported that the rioting was not intense.

Some of the crowd spotted paratroopers hiding in a derelict three-storey building overlooking William Street, and began throwing stones at the windows. At about 3:55pm, these paratroopers opened fire. Civilians Damien Donaghy and John Johnston were shot and wounded while standing on waste ground opposite the building. These were the first shots fired. The soldiers claimed Donaghy was holding a black cylindrical object, but the Saville Inquiry concluded that all of those shot were unarmed.

At 4:07pm, the paratroopers were ordered to go through the barriers and arrest rioters. The paratroopers, on foot and in armoured vehicles, chased people down Rossville Street and into the Bogside. Two people were knocked down by the vehicles. Brigadier MacLellan had ordered that only one company of paratroopers be sent through the barriers, on foot, and that they should not chase people down Rossville Street. Colonel Wilford disobeyed this order, which meant there was no separation between rioters and peaceful marchers.

The paratroopers disembarked and began seizing people. There were many claims of paratroopers beating people, clubbing them with rifle butts, firing rubber bullets at them from close range, making threats to kill, and hurling abuse. The Saville Report agreed that soldiers "used excessive force when arresting people […] as well as seriously assaulting them for no good reason while in their custody".

One group of paratroopers took up position at a low wall about in front of a rubble barricade that stretched across Rossville Street. There were people at the barricade and some were throwing stones at the soldiers, but none were near enough to hit them. The soldiers fired on the people at the barricade, killing six and wounding a seventh.

A large group of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area was like a courtyard, surrounded on three sides by high-rise flats. The soldiers opened fire, killing one civilian and wounding six others. This fatality, Jackie Duddy, was running alongside a priest, <a href="Bishop%20Edward%20Daly">Father Edward Daly</a>, when he was shot in the back.

Another group of people fled into the car park of Glenfada Park, which was also a courtyard-like area surrounded by flats. Here, the soldiers shot at people across the car park, about 40–50 yards away. Two civilians were killed and at least four others wounded. The Saville Report says it is "probable" that at least one soldier fired from the hip towards the crowd, without aiming.

The soldiers went through the car park and out the other side. Some soldiers went out the southwest corner, where they shot dead two civilians. The other soldiers went out the southeast corner and shot four more civilians, killing two.

About ten minutes had elapsed between the time soldiers drove into the Bogside and the time the last of the civilians was shot. More than 100 rounds were fired by the soldiers.

Some of those shot were given <a href="first%20aid">first aid</a> by civilian volunteers, either on the scene or after being carried into nearby homes. They were then driven to hospital, either in civilian cars or in ambulances. The first ambulances arrived at 4:28pm. The three boys killed at the rubble barricade were driven to hospital by the paratroopers. Witnesses said paratroopers lifted the bodies by the hands and feet and dumped them in the back of their APC, as if they were "pieces of meat". The Saville Report agreed that this is an "accurate description of what happened". It says the paratroopers "might well have felt themselves at risk, but in our view this does not excuse them".

In all, 26 people were shot by the paratroopers; 13 died on the day and another died four months later. Most of them were killed in four main areas: the rubble barricade across Rossville Street, the courtyard car park of Rossville Flats (on the north side of the flats), the courtyard car park of Glenfada Park, and the forecourt of Rossville Flats (on the south side of the flats).

All of the soldiers responsible insisted that they had shot at, and hit, gunmen or bomb-throwers. The Saville Report concluded that all of those shot were unarmed and that none were posing a serious threat. It also concluded that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks, or threatened attacks, by gunmen or bomb-throwers.

The casualties are listed in the order in which they were killed.


Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds. The official army position, backed by the British <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> the next day in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, was that the paratroopers had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members. All eyewitnesses (apart from the soldiers), including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present, maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims.

On 2 February, the day that 12 of those killed were buried, there was a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in the Republic, described as the biggest general strike in Europe since the Second World War relative to population. Memorial services were held in Catholic and Protestant churches, as well as synagogues, throughout the Republic. The same day, irate crowds burned down the <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20Dublin">British embassy</a> on <a href="Merrion%20Square">Merrion Square</a> in Dublin. <a href="Ireland%E2%80%93United%20Kingdom%20relations">Anglo-Irish relations</a> hit one of their lowest ebbs with the <a href="Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade">Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Hillery">Patrick Hillery</a>, going to the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> to demand the involvement of a <a href="United%20Nations%20peacekeeping">UN peacekeeping</a> force in the Northern Ireland "Troubles".

Although there were many IRA men—both Official and Provisional—at the protest, it is claimed they were all unarmed, apparently because it was anticipated that the paratroopers would attempt to "draw them out." March organiser and MP <a href="Ivan%20Cooper">Ivan Cooper</a> had been promised beforehand that no armed IRA men would be near the march. One paratrooper who gave evidence at the tribunal testified that they were told by an officer to expect a gunfight and "We want some kills." In the event, one man was witnessed by Father Edward Daly and others haphazardly firing a revolver in the direction of the paratroopers. Later identified as a member of the Official IRA, this man was also photographed in the act of drawing his weapon, but was apparently not seen or targeted by the soldiers. Various other claims have been made to the Saville Inquiry about gunmen on the day.

The city's <a href="coroner">coroner</a>, Hubert O'Neill, a retired <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> major, issued a statement on 21 August 1973 at the completion of the <a href="inquest">inquest</a> into the deaths of those killed. He declared:
Two days after Bloody Sunday, the Westminster Parliament adopted a resolution for a <a href="tribunal">tribunal</a> into the events of the day, resulting in Prime Minister <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a> commissioning the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Lord Chief Justice</a>, Lord Widgery, to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to <a href="boycott">boycott</a> the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report—completed within 10 weeks (10 April) and published within 11 (19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. Most witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a whitewash. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation involved the use of lead-based <a href="solder">solder</a>. In 1992, <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>, writing to John Hume stated:

Following the events of Bloody Sunday <a href="Bernadette%20Devlin%20McAliskey">Bernadette Devlin</a>, an Independent Socialist nationalist MP from Northern Ireland, expressed anger at what she perceived as government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the day. Having witnessed the events firsthand, she was later infuriated that Speaker <a href="Selwyn%20Lloyd">Selwyn Lloyd</a> consistently denied her the chance to speak in Parliament about the day, although parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in the House.
Devlin punched <a href="Reginald%20Maudling">Reginald Maudling</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Home%20Department">Secretary of State for the Home Department</a> in the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government, when he made a statement to Parliament on the events of Bloody Sunday stating that the British Army had fired only in self-defence.
She was temporarily suspended from Parliament as a result of the incident. Nonetheless, six months after Bloody Sunday, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Derek%20Wilford">Derek Wilford</a> who was directly in charge of 1 Para, the soldiers who went into the Bogside, was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.

In January 1997, the UK television broadcaster <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> carried a news report suggesting that members of the <a href="Royal%20Anglian%20Regiment">Royal Anglian Regiment</a> had also opened fire on the protesters, and could have been responsible for three of the 14 deaths.

On 29 May 2007, General (then Captain) Sir <a href="Mike%20Jackson%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Mike Jackson</a>, adjutant of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: "I have no doubt that innocent people were shot." This was in sharp contrast to his insistence, for more than 30 years, that those killed on the day had not been innocent. In 2008 a former aide to British Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Powell%20%28aide%29">Jonathan Powell</a>, described Widgery as a "complete and utter whitewash."
In 1998 Lieutenant Colonel Derek Wilford expressed his anger at Tony Blair's intention of setting up the Saville inquiry, stating that he was proud of his actions on Bloody Sunday. Two years later in 2000 during an interview with the BBC, Wilford said: "There might have been things wrong in the sense that some innocent people, people who were not carrying a weapon, were wounded or even killed. But that was not done as a deliberate malicious act. It was done as an act of war."

On 10 November 2015, a 66-year-old former member of the Parachute Regiment was arrested for questioning over the deaths of William Nash, Michael McDaid and John Young.

Although British Prime Minister John Major rejected John Hume's requests for a <a href="public%20inquiry">public inquiry</a> into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday. The other judges were <a href="John%20Toohey%20%28judge%29">John Toohey</a> <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a>, a former <a href="Judge">Justice</a> of the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a> who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir <a href="Edward%20Somers">Edward Somers</a> QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Hoyt">William Hoyt</a> QC, former <a href="Chief%20Justice">Chief Justice</a> of <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and a member of the <a href="Canadian%20Judicial%20Council">Canadian Judicial Council</a>. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010. The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and made the point that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.

Evidence given by <a href="Martin%20McGuinness">Martin McGuinness</a>, a senior member of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a> and later the <a href="deputy%20First%20Minister%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland</a>, to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the Derry City brigade of the Provisional IRA and was present at the march. A claim was made at the Saville Inquiry that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the <a href="Fianna%20%C3%89ireann">Fianna Éireann</a>, the youth wing of the IRA in January 1972. He claimed that McGuinness, the second-in-command of the IRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous IRA member gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as "fantasy", while Gerry O'Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.

Many observers allege that the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> acted in a way to impede the inquiry. Over 1,000 army photographs and original army helicopter video footage were never made available. Additionally, guns used on the day by the soldiers that could have been evidence in the inquiry were lost by the MoD. The MoD claimed that all the guns had been destroyed, but some were subsequently recovered in various locations (such as <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>) despite the obstruction.

By the time the inquiry had retired to write up its findings, it had interviewed over 900 witnesses, over seven years, making it the biggest investigation in <a href="Law%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British legal</a> history. The cost of this process has drawn criticism; as of the publication of the Saville Report being .
The inquiry was expected to report in late 2009 but was delayed until after the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">general election on 6 May 2010</a>.

The report of the inquiry was published on 15 June 2010. The report concluded, "The firing by soldiers of 1 PARA on Bloody Sunday caused the deaths of 13 people and injury to a similar number, none of whom was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury." Saville stated that British paratroopers "lost control", fatally shooting fleeing civilians and those who tried to aid civilians who had been shot by the British soldiers. The report stated that British soldiers had concocted lies in their attempt to hide their acts. Saville stated that the civilians had not been warned by the British soldiers that they intended to shoot. The report states, contrary to the previously established belief, that no stones and no petrol bombs were thrown by civilians before British soldiers shot at them, and that the civilians were not posing any threat.

The report concluded that an Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers, albeit that on the balance of evidence his shot was fired "after" the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself. Ultimately the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on Martin McGuinness' role, due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was "engaged in paramilitary activity" during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a <a href="Thompson%20submachine%20gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>, there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were "sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire".

Regarding the soldiers in charge on the day of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry arrived at the following findings:


Reporting on the findings of the Saville Inquiry in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, the British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> said:

"Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic. I never want to believe anything bad about our country. I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong."

<a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, then the <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28UK%29">Leader of the Opposition</a> in the House of Commons, reiterated his belief that a <a href="united%20Ireland">united Ireland</a> was the only possible solution to Northern Ireland's Troubles. <a href="William%20Craig%20%28Northern%20Ireland%20politician%29">William Craig</a>, then Stormont Home Affairs Minister, suggested that the west bank of Derry should be ceded to the Republic of Ireland.

When it was deployed on duty in Northern Ireland, the British Army was welcomed by Roman Catholics as a neutral force there to protect them from Protestant mobs, the RUC and the <a href="Ulster%20Special%20Constabulary">B-Specials</a>. After Bloody Sunday many Catholics turned on the British army, seeing it no longer as their protector but as their enemy. Young <a href="Irish%20nationalism">nationalists</a> became increasingly attracted to violent <a href="Irish%20republicanism">republican</a> groups. With the Official IRA and <a href="Official%20Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Official Sinn Féin</a> having moved away from mainstream Irish republicanism towards <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, the Provisional IRA began to win the support of newly radicalised, disaffected young people.

In the following twenty years, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other smaller republican groups such as the <a href="Irish%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Irish National Liberation Army</a> (INLA) stepped up their <a href="Provisional%20IRA%20campaign%201969%E2%80%931997">armed campaigns</a> against the state and those seen as being in service to it. With rival paramilitary organisations appearing in both the nationalist/republican and <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionist</a>/<a href="Ulster%20loyalist">loyalist</a> communities (such as the <a href="Ulster%20Defence%20Association">Ulster Defence Association</a> (UDA), <a href="Ulster%20Volunteer%20Force%20%281966%29">Ulster Volunteer Force</a> (UVF), etc. on the loyalist side), the Troubles cost the lives of thousands of people.

In his speech to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: "These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible." He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers, and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though "there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate" as "what happened should never, ever have happened". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was "deeply sorry".

A survey conducted by <a href="Angus%20Reid%20Public%20Opinion">Angus Reid Public Opinion</a> in June 2010 found that 61 per cent of Britons and 70 per cent of Northern Irish agreed with Cameron's apology for the Bloody Sunday events.

Stephen Pollard, solicitor representing several of the soldiers, said on 15 June 2010 that Saville had cherry-picked the evidence and did not have justification for his findings.
In 2012 an actively serving British army soldier from Belfast was charged with inciting hatred by a surviving relative of the deceased, due to their online use of social media to promote sectarian slogans about the killings while featuring banners of the Parachute Regiment logo.

In January 2013, shortly before the annual Bloody Sunday remembrance march, two Parachute Regiment flags appeared in the loyalist Fountain, and Waterside, <a href="Drumahoe">Drumahoe</a> areas of Derry. The display of the flags was heavily criticised by nationalist politicians and relatives of the Bloody Sunday dead. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> also condemned the flying of the flags. The flags were removed to be replaced by Union Flags. In the run up to the loyalist marching season in 2013 the flag of the Parachute Regiment appeared alongside other loyalist flags in other parts of Northern Ireland. In 2014 loyalists in <a href="Cookstown">Cookstown</a> erected the flags in opposition, close to the route of a <a href="St.Patrick%27s%20Day">St.Patrick's Day</a> parade in the town.

<a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> (who is of Irish descent) recorded the first song in response only two days after the incident. The single entitled "<a href="Give%20Ireland%20Back%20to%20the%20Irish">Give Ireland Back to the Irish</a>", expressed his views on the matter. It was one of a few McCartney solo songs to be banned by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>.

The 1972 <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> album "<a href="Some%20Time%20in%20New%20York%20City">Some Time in New York City</a>" features a song entitled "Sunday Bloody Sunday", inspired by the incident, as well as the song "The Luck of the Irish", which dealt more with the Irish conflict in general. Lennon, who was of Irish descent, also spoke at a protest in New York in support of the victims and families of Bloody Sunday.

Irish poet <a href="Thomas%20Kinsella">Thomas Kinsella</a>'s 1972 poem "Butcher's Dozen" is a satirical and angry response to the Widgery Tribunal and the events of Bloody Sunday.

<a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s <a href="Geezer%20Butler">Geezer Butler</a> (also of Irish descent) wrote the lyrics to the Black Sabbath song "<a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath%20%28song%29">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a>" on the album of the <a href="Sabbath%20Bloody%20Sabbath">same name</a> in 1973. Butler stated, "…the Sunday Bloody Sunday thing had just happened in Ireland, when the British troops opened fire on the Irish demonstrators… So I came up with the title 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', and sort of put it in how the band was feeling at the time, getting away from management, mixed with the state Ireland was in."

The <a href="Roy%20Harper%20%28singer%29">Roy Harper</a> song "All Ireland" from the album "<a href="Lifemask">Lifemask</a>", written in the days following the incident, is critical of the military but takes a long term view with regard to a solution. In Harper's book ("The Passions of Great Fortune"), his comment on the song ends "…there must always be some hope that the children of 'Bloody Sunday', on both sides, can grow into some wisdom".

<a href="Brian%20Friel">Brian Friel</a>'s 1973 play "<a href="The%20Freedom%20of%20the%20City">The Freedom of the City</a>" deals with the incident from the viewpoint of three civilians.

Irish poet <a href="Seamus%20Heaney">Seamus Heaney</a>'s "Casualty" (published in "Field Work," 1981) criticizes Britain for the death of his friend.

The incident has been commemorated by Irish band, <a href="U2">U2</a>, in their 1983 <a href="protest%20song">protest song</a> "<a href="Sunday%20Bloody%20Sunday%20%28song%29">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>".

<a href="Christy%20Moore">Christy Moore</a>'s song "Minds Locked Shut" on the album "Graffiti Tongue" is all about the events of the day, and names the dead civilians.

The events of the day have been dramatised in two 2002 television films, "<a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%28TV%20film%29">Bloody Sunday</a>" (starring <a href="James%20Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a>) and "<a href="Sunday%20%282002%20film%29">Sunday</a>" by <a href="Jimmy%20McGovern">Jimmy McGovern</a>.

The <a href="Celtic%20metal">Celtic metal</a> band <a href="Cruachan%20%28band%29">Cruachan</a> addressed the incident in a song "Bloody Sunday" from their 2004 album "<a href="Folk-Lore">Folk-Lore</a>".

Bruno of Querfurt

Saint Bruno of Querfurt ( 974 – February 14, 1009 AD), also known as "Brun" and "Boniface", was a <a href="missionary">missionary</a> <a href="bishop">bishop</a> and <a href="Christian%20martyrs">martyr</a>, who was beheaded near the border of <a href="Kievan%20Rus">Kievan Rus</a> and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> while trying to spread Christianity in Eastern Europe. He is also called the second "Apostle of the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a>".

Bruno was from a noble family of <a href="Querfurt">Querfurt</a> (now in <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a>). He is rumored to have been a relative of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto III</a>. At the age of six, he was sent to be educated at the cathedral school in <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>, seat of <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Magdeburg">Adalbert of Magdeburg</a>, the teacher and namesake of <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Prague">Saint Adalbert</a>. While still a youth, he was made a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Magdeburg">Cathedral of Magdeburg</a>. The fifteen-year-old Otto III made Bruno a part of his royal court. While in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> for Otto's imperial coronation, Bruno met <a href="Adalbert%20of%20Prague">Saint Adalbert of Prague</a>, the first "Apostle of the Prussians", killed a year later, which inspired Bruno to write a biography of St. Adalbert when he reached the <a href="Christianization%23Hungary">recently Christianized</a> and consolidated <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> himself. Bruno spent much time at the monastery where Adalbert had become a <a href="monk">monk</a> and where abbot <a href="John%20Canaparius">John Canaparius</a> may have written a life of Saint Adalbert. Later, Bruno entered a monastery near <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a> that Otto had founded, and underwent strict <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> training under the guidance of <a href="Saint%20Romuald">Saint Romuald</a>.

<a href="Otto%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto III</a> hoped to establish a monastery between the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> and the <a href="Oder">Oder</a> (somewhere in the <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> lands that became <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> or Western <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>) to help convert the local population to Christianity and colonize the area. In 1001, two monks from his monastery traveled to Poland, while Bruno was with Otto in Italy, studying the language and awaiting the Apostolic appointment by <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a>. 

In 1003 <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Pope Sylvester II</a> appointed Bruno, at the age of 33, to head a mission amongst the pagan peoples of Eastern Europe. Bruno left Rome in 1004, and having been named an archbishop was consecrated in February of that year by Archbishop Tagino of Magdeburg. Owing to a regional conflict between the <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Henry II</a> and <a href="Boleslaus%20I%20of%20Poland">Duke Boleslaus I of Poland</a> he delayed the plans for the monastery, and so Bruno set out for Hungary. There he went to the places that Saint Adalbert of Prague had attended.

Bruno tried to persuade <a href="Ahtum">Ahtum</a>, the Duke of <a href="Banat">Banat</a>, who was under jurisdiction of <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</a> to accept the jurisdiction of the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rome">Bishop of Rome</a>, but this precipitated a large controversy leading to organized opposition from local monks. Bruno elected to gracefully exit the region after he first finished his book, the famous ""Life of <a href="Saint%20Adalbert%20of%20Prague">St. Adalbert</a>,"" a literary memorial of much worth giving a history of the (relatively recent) conversion of the Hungarians.

After this diplomatic failure, Bruno went to <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, where Grand Duke <a href="Vladimir%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Kiev">Vladimir I</a> authorized him to make <a href="Christian">Christian</a> converts among the <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a>, semi-nomadic <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic peoples</a> living between the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and the <a href="Don%20River%2C%20Russia">Don</a> rivers. Bruno spent five months there and baptized some thirty adults. He helped to bring about a peace treaty between them and the ruler of Kiev.

Before leaving for Poland, Bruno <a href="Consecration">consecrated</a> a bishop for the <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a>. While in Poland he consecrated the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sweden">Bishop of Sweden</a> and is said to have sent emissaries to baptize the king of Sweden, whose mother had come from Poland. Bruno found out that his friend Benedict and four companions had been killed by robbers in 1003. Bruno took eyewitness accounts and wrote down a touching history of the so-called Five Martyred Brothers.

In the autumn or at the end of 1008 Bruno and eighteen companions set out to found a mission among the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Old Prussians</a>; they succeeded in converting <a href="Netimer">Netimer</a> and then traveled to the east, heading very likely towards <a href="Yotvingians">Yotvingia</a>. Yotvingia was a Prussian region, then subordinate to <a href="Kievan%20Rus">Kievan Rus</a> (since 983), that intersected the borders of what was then <a href="Old%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, Kievan Rus and the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Duchy of Lithuania</a>.

Saint Bruno was <a href="decapitation">beheaded</a> on February 14, 1009, whereas most of his companions were hanged the same day by Zebeden, brother of Netimer. Duke <a href="Boleslaus%20the%20Brave">Boleslaus the Brave</a> brought the bodies to Poland (it was supposed that they were laid to rest in <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl</a>, where some historians place Bruno's diocese; such localization of the Bruno's burial place is hardly probable because Przemyśl then belonged to <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> Kievan Rus through 1018). The "Annals of Magdeburg," <a href="Thietmar%20of%20Merseburg">Thietmar of Merseburg</a>'s "Chronicle", the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Quedlinburg">Annals of Quedlinburg</a>", various works of <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a> Bishops, and many other written sources of 11th–15th centuries record this story.

Soon after his death, Bruno and his companions were venerated as martyrs and Bruno was soon after <a href="canonized">canonized</a>. It was said that <a href="Braunsberg">Braunsberg</a> was named after St Bruno.

Bo Diddley

Ellas McDaniel (born Ellas Otha Bates, December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known as Bo Diddley, was an American <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> singer, guitarist, songwriter and music producer who played a key role in the transition from the <a href="blues">blues</a> to <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, and influenced artists including <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>, the <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a>, the <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, the <a href="The%20Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>, <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, the <a href="The%20Who">Who</a>, <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="George%20Thorogood">George Thorogood</a>, <a href="Parliament-Funkadelic">Parliament-Funkadelic</a>, and <a href="The%20Clash">The Clash</a>.

His use of <a href="Music%20of%20Africa">African rhythms</a> and a <a href="Bo%20Diddley%20beat">signature beat</a>, a simple five-<a href="Accent%20%28music%29">accent</a> <a href="clave%20%28rhythm%29">hambone</a> rhythm, is a cornerstone of <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>, and <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>. In recognition of his achievements, he was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the <a href="Rhythm%20and%20Blues%20Foundation">Rhythm and Blues Foundation</a> and a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> from the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Recording%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</a>. He is also recognized for his technical innovations, including his distinctive rectangular guitar.

Born in <a href="McComb%2C%20Mississippi">McComb, Mississippi</a>, as Ellas Otha Bates, he was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the <a href="South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">South Side</a> of Chicago, where he dropped the Otha and became Ellas McDaniel. He was an active member of Chicago's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he studied the <a href="trombone">trombone</a> and the violin, becoming so proficient on the violin that the musical director invited him to join the orchestra. He performed until he was 18. However, he was more interested in the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local <a href="Pentecostal%20Church">Pentecostal church</a> and took up the guitar.

Inspired by a performance by <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>, he supplemented his income as a carpenter and mechanic by <a href="busking">playing on street corners</a> with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973), in the Hipsters band, later renamed the Langley Avenue Jive Cats. Green became a near-constant member of McDaniel's backing band, the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows. During the summers of 1943 and 1944, he played at the <a href="Maxwell%20Street">Maxwell Street</a> market in a band with <a href="Earl%20Hooker">Earl Hooker</a>. By 1951 he was playing on the street with backing from Roosevelt Jackson on <a href="washtub%20bass">washtub bass</a> and <a href="Jody%20Williams%20%28blues%20musician%29">Jody Williams</a>, whom he had taught to play the guitar. Williams later played lead guitar on "<a href="Who%20Do%20You%20Love%3F%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">Who Do You Love?</a>" (1956).

In 1951, he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club, on Chicago's South Side, with a repertoire influenced by <a href="Louis%20Jordan">Louis Jordan</a>, John Lee Hooker, and <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a>. In late 1954, he teamed up with the harmonica player <a href="Billy%20Boy%20Arnold">Billy Boy Arnold</a>, the drummer Clifton James and the <a href="Bassist">bass player</a> Roosevelt Jackson and recorded <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> of "<a href="I%27m%20a%20Man%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">I'm a Man</a>" and "<a href="Bo%20Diddley%20%28song%29">Bo Diddley</a>". They re-recorded the songs at <a href="Chess%20Records">Chess Studios</a>, with a backing <a href="musical%20ensemble">ensemble</a> comprising <a href="Otis%20Spann">Otis Spann</a> (piano), <a href="Lester%20Davenport">Lester Davenport</a> (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">A-side</a>, "Bo Diddley", became a number one R&B hit.

The origin of the stage name Bo Diddley is unclear. McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name, which he suspected was an insult. He also said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother knew. Harmonicist <a href="Billy%20Boy%20Arnold">Billy Boy Arnold</a> said that it was a local comedian's name, which <a href="Leonard%20Chess">Leonard Chess</a> adopted as McDaniel's stage name and the title of his first single. McDaniel also stated that it was his nickname as a <a href="Golden%20Gloves">Golden Gloves</a> boxer.

A <a href="diddley%20bow">diddley bow</a> is a homemade single-string instrument played mainly by farm workers in the South. It probably has influences from the <a href="West%20African">West African</a> coast. In the American slang term "bo diddly", "bo" is an intensifier and "diddly" is a truncation of "diddly squat", which means "absolutely nothing".

On November 20, 1955, Diddley appeared on the popular television program "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>". When someone on the show's staff overheard him casually singing "<a href="Sixteen%20Tons">Sixteen Tons</a>" in the dressing room, he was asked to perform the song on the show. Seeing "Bo Diddley" on the cue card, he thought he was to perform both <a href="Bo%20Diddley%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">his self-titled hit single</a> and "Sixteen Tons". Sullivan was furious and banned Diddley from his show, reputedly saying that he wouldn't last six months. Chess Records included Diddley's cover of "Sixteen Tons" on the 1960 album "<a href="Bo%20Diddley%20Is%20a%20Gunslinger">Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger</a>".

Diddley's hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s: "Pretty Thing" (1956), "Say Man" (1959), and "<a href="You%20Can%27t%20Judge%20a%20Book%20by%20the%20Cover">You Can't Judge a pageRank.Book by the Cover</a>" (1962). He also released numerous albums, including "Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger" and "Have Guitar, Will Travel". These bolstered his self-invented legend. Between 1958 and 1963, <a href="Checker%20Records">Checker Records</a> released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. In the 1960s he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the <a href="Alan%20Freed">Alan Freed</a> concerts, for example), but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. The album title "Surfing with Bo Diddley" derived from his influence on <a href="surf%20music">surf</a> guitarists rather than surfing per se.

In 1963, Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the <a href="Everly%20Brothers">Everly Brothers</a> and <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a> along with the Rolling Stones ( an unknown band at that time). 

He wrote many songs for himself and also for others. In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the <a href="pop%20music">pop song</a> "<a href="Love%20Is%20Strange">Love Is Strange</a>", a hit for <a href="Mickey%20%26amp%3B%20Sylvia">Mickey & Sylvia</a> in 1957. He also wrote "Mama (Can I Go Out)", which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer <a href="Jo%20Ann%20Campbell">Jo Ann Campbell</a>, who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film "<a href="Go%20Johnny%20Go">Go Johnny Go</a>".

After moving from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the basement of his home at 2614 Rhode Island Avenue NE, housed his first <a href="home%20recording">home recording</a> studio. Diddley's home studio was frequented by several of Washington, D.C.'s musical luminaries and the site where he recorded the commercially released album "Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger". Diddley also produced and recorded <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> (his valet), a member of the local Doo Wop group, the Marquees. Diddley co-wrote the Marquees' first single featuring Gaye titled "Wyatt Earp". It was released on <a href="Okeh%20Records">Okeh Records</a>, after the Chess brothers turned it down. During this time, <a href="Moonglows">Moonglows</a>' founder <a href="Harvey%20Fuqua">Harvey Fuqua</a> sang backing vocals on many of Diddley's home recordings. Gaye later joined the Moonglows and followed them to Motown.

Diddley included women in his band: <a href="Norma-Jean%20Wofford">Norma-Jean Wofford</a>, also known as The Duchess; Gloria Jolivet; <a href="Peggy%20Jones%20%28musician%29">Peggy Jones</a>, also known as Lady Bo, a lead guitarist (rare for a woman at that time); Cornelia Redmond, also known as Cookie V; Debby Hastings, who led his band after guitarist Jim Satten resigned.

Over the decades, Diddley's performing venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with the <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a> at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Music%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Academy of Music</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as <a href="Dick%27s%20Picks%20Volume%2030">Volume 30</a> of the band's concert album series, "<a href="Dick%27s%20Picks">Dick's Picks</a>". Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack of the ground-breaking animated film "<a href="Fritz%20the%20Cat%20%28film%29">Fritz the Cat</a>" contained his song "Bo Diddley", in which a crow idly <a href="Fingerstyle%20guitar">finger-pops</a> to the track.

Diddley spent some years in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, living in <a href="Los%20Lunas%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Lunas</a> from 1971 to 1978, while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as a deputy sheriff in the <a href="Valencia%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico">Valencia County</a> Citizens' Patrol; during that time he purchased and donated three highway-patrol pursuit cars. In the late 1970s, he left Los Lunas and moved to <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20Florida">Hawthorne, Florida</a>, where he lived on a large estate in a custom-made log cabin, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he divided his time between <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque</a> and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in <a href="Archer%2C%20Florida">Archer, Florida</a>, a small farming town near <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a>.
In 1979, he appeared as an opening act for the <a href="The%20Clash">Clash</a> on their US tour and in "Legends of Guitar" (filmed live in Spain in 1991), with <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a>, <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a>, <a href="Albert%20Collins">Albert Collins</a>, and <a href="George%20Benson">George Benson</a>, among others. He joined the Rolling Stones on their 1994 concert broadcast of "<a href="Voodoo%20Lounge">Voodoo Lounge</a>", performing "<a href="Who%20Do%20You%20Love%3F%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">Who Do You Love?</a>".

Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer <a href="Johnnie%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Johnnie Johnson</a> and his band, consisting of Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass. In 2006, he participated as the headliner of a <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a>-organized fundraiser concert to benefit the town of <a href="Ocean%20Springs%2C%20Mississippi">Ocean Springs, Mississippi</a>, which had been devastated by <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. The "Florida Keys for Katrina Relief" had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Hurricane Wilma</a> barreled through the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a> on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem. In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser, Diddley stated, "This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another". In an interview with Holger Petersen, on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Blues">Saturday Night Blues</a>" on <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a> in the fall of 2006, He commented on racism in the music industry establishment during his early career, which deprived him of <a href="royalties">royalties</a> from the most successful part of his career.

His final guitar performance on a studio album was with the <a href="New%20York%20Dolls">New York Dolls</a> on their 2006 album "<a href="One%20Day%20It%20Will%20Please%20Us%20to%20Remember%20Even%20This">One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This</a>". He contributed guitar work to the song "Seventeen", which was included as a bonus track on the limited-edition version of the disc.

In 1989, Diddley entered into a licensing agreement with the sportswear brand <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>. The Wieden & Kennedy produced commercial in the "<a href="Bo%20Knows">Bo Knows</a>" campaign, teamed Diddley with dual sportsman <a href="Bo%20Jackson">Bo Jackson</a>, and resulted in one of the most iconic advertisements in advertising history. The agreement ended in 1991, but in 1999, a T-shirt of Diddley's image and "You don't know diddley" slogan was purchased in a Gainesville, Florida sports apparel store. Diddley felt that Nike should not continue to use the slogan or his likeness and fought Nike over the copyright infringement. Despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed legal arrangement, Nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel and ignored cease-and-desist orders, and a lawsuit was filed on Diddley's behalf, in Manhattan Federal Court.

In 1996, he released A Man Amongst Men, his first major label album with guest artists like Keith Richards, Ron Wood and the Shirelles. The album earned a Grammy Award nomination in 1997 for the Best Contemporary Blues Album category. 

On May 13, 2007, Diddley was admitted to <a href="intensive%20care">intensive care</a> in <a href="Creighton%20University%20Medical%20Center">Creighton University Medical Center</a> in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, following a stroke after a concert the previous day in <a href="Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa">Council Bluffs, Iowa</a>. Starting the show, he had complained that he did not feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging south Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. Nonetheless, he delivered an energetic performance to an enthusiastic crowd. The next day, as he was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport; 911 and airport security were called, and he was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center and admitted to the <a href="intensive%20care%20unit">intensive care unit</a>, where he stayed for several days. After tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a stroke. Diddley had a history of <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> and <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, and the stroke affected the left side of his brain, causing receptive and expressive <a href="aphasia">aphasia</a> (speech impairment). The stroke was followed by a heart attack, which he suffered in Gainesville, Florida, on August 28, 2007.

While recovering from the stroke and heart attack, Diddley came back to his hometown of McComb, Mississippi, in early November 2007, for the unveiling of a plaque devoted to him on the <a href="Mississippi%20Blues%20Trail">Mississippi Blues Trail</a>. This marked his achievements and noted that he was "acclaimed as a founder of rock-and-roll." He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson, who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that Diddley wanted to perform and handed him a microphone, the only time that he performed publicly after his stroke.

Bo Diddley died on June 2, 2008, of <a href="Congestive%20heart%20failure">heart failure</a> at his home in Archer, Florida. Garry Mitchell, his grandson and one of more than 35 family members at the musician's home when he died at 1:45 a.m. EDT (05:45 GMT), said his death was not unexpected. "There was a <a href="gospel%20music">gospel song</a> that was sung (at his bedside) and (when it was done) he said 'wow' with a thumbs up," Mitchell told Reuters, when asked to describe the scene at the deathbed. "The song was 'Walk Around Heaven' and in his last words he said 'I'm going to heaven.'"

His funeral, a four-hour "homegoing" service, took place on June 7, 2008, at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida, and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley's life and career. The many in attendance chanted "Hey Bo Diddley" as a gospel band played the legend's music.

In 2004, <a href="Mickey%20Baker">Mickey</a> and <a href="Sylvia%20Vanderpool">Sylvia's</a> 1956 recording of "<a href="Love%20Is%20Strange">Love Is Strange</a>" (a song first recorded by Bo Diddley but not released until a year before his death) was inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a> as a recording of qualitative or historical significance. Also in 2004, Bo Diddley was inducted into the <a href="Blues%20Foundation">Blues Foundation</a>'s Blues Hall of Fame and was ranked number 20 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's list of the <a href="https%3A//www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/">100 Greatest Artists of All Time</a>.

In the <a href="UK">UK</a>, "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" magazine included his 1957 debut album, "Bo Diddley", in its listing of the '100 Music, Movie & TV Moments That Have Changed the World'.

Bo Diddley was honored by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a <a href="Mississippi%20Blues%20Trail">Mississippi Blues Trail</a> historic marker placed in <a href="McComb%2C%20Mississippi">McComb</a>, his birthplace, in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in Mississippi. On June 5, 2009, the city of <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville, Florida</a>, officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The plaza was the site of a benefit concert at which Bo Diddley performed to raise awareness about the plight of the homeless in <a href="Alachua%20County">Alachua County</a> and to raise money for local charities, including the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a>.

The "Bo Diddley beat" is essentially the <a href="clave%20rhythm">clave rhythm</a>, one of the most common <a href="bell%20pattern">bell pattern</a>s found in <a href="sub-Saharan%20African%20music%20traditions">sub-Saharan African music traditions</a>. One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by <a href="Johnny%20Otis">Johnny Otis</a> from 1948.

Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. Sublette asserts, "In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets." The Bo Diddley beat is similar to "<a href="Juba%20dance">hambone</a>", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes. Somewhat resembling the <a href="Shave%20and%20a%20Haircut">"shave and a haircut, two bits"</a> rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play <a href="Gene%20Autry">Gene Autry</a>'s "(I've Got Spurs That) <a href="Jingle%2C%20Jangle%2C%20Jingle">Jingle, Jangle, Jingle</a>". Three years before his "Bo Diddley", a song with similar syncopation "Hambone", was cut by the <a href="Red%20Saunders%20%28musician%29">Red Saunders</a> Orchestra with the Hambone Kids. In 1944, "<a href="Rum%20and%20Coca%20Cola">Rum and Coca Cola</a>", containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by the <a href="the%20Andrews%20Sisters">Andrews Sisters</a>. <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>'s "<a href="Not%20Fade%20Away%20%28song%29">Not Fade Away</a>" (1957) and <a href="Them%20%28band%29">Them's</a> "<a href="Mystic%20Eyes">Mystic Eyes</a>" (1965) used the beat.

Many songs (for example, "<a href="Hey%20Bo%20Diddley">Hey Bo Diddley</a>" and "<a href="Who%20Do%20You%20Love%3F%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">Who Do You Love?</a>") often have no <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chord</a> changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic <a href="tension%20%28music%29">tension and release</a>. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used various rhythms, from straight <a href="beat%20%28music%29">back beat</a> to <a href="Popular%20music">pop</a> <a href="ballad">ballad</a> style to <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a>, frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.

An influential guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied "Twang Machine" (referred to as "cigar-box shaped" by music promoter <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>) built by <a href="Gretsch">Gretsch</a>. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the "Cadillac" and the rectangular "Turbo 5-speed" (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on <a href="Triple%20J">JJJ</a> radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a <a href="Gibson%20L5">Gibson L5</a> guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin. He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the violin, which is featured on his mournful <a href="instrumental%20rock">instrumental</a> "The Clock Strikes Twelve", a <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a>.

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> themes. The song "Bo Diddley" was based on the African-American clapping rhyme "<a href="Juba%20dance">Hambone</a>" (which in turn was based on the <a href="lullaby">lullaby</a> "<a href="Hush%20Little%20Baby">Hush Little Baby</a>"). Likewise, "Hey Bo Diddley" is based on the song "<a href="Old%20MacDonald">Old MacDonald</a>". The song "Who Do You Love?" with its <a href="roots%20of%20hip%20hop">rap</a>-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as "<a href="the%20dozens">the dozens</a>" on the songs "Say Man" and "Say Man, Back Again," are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music (for example, "You got the nerve to call somebody ugly. Why, you so ugly, the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested").
