Augustin-Louis Cauchy

<a href="Baron">Baron</a> Augustin-Louis Cauchy <a href="Royal%20Society">FRS</a> <a href="FRSE">FRSE</a> (; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857) was a <a href="France">French</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="physicist">physicist</a> who made pioneering contributions to <a href="mathematical%20analysis">analysis</a>. He was one of the first to state and prove theorems of <a href="calculus">calculus</a> rigorously, rejecting the heuristic principle of the <a href="generality%20of%20algebra">generality of algebra</a> of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a> and the study of <a href="permutation%20group">permutation group</a>s in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>. A profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors. His writings range widely in mathematics and <a href="mathematical%20physics">mathematical physics</a>.

"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in <a href="Elasticity%20%28physics%29">elasticity</a> alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy)." Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks.

Cauchy was the son of <a href="Louis%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cauchy">Louis François Cauchy</a> (1760–1848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers, Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792–1857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and Eugene François Cauchy (1802–1877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.

Cauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818. She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. By her he had two daughters, Marie Françoise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823).

Cauchy's father (<a href="Louis%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Cauchy">Louis François Cauchy</a>) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime. He lost his position because of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (July 14, 1789) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born. The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> (1794) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father. After the execution of <a href="Robespierre">Robespierre</a> (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-François Cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job, and quickly moved up the ranks. When <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> came to power (1799), Louis-François Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Laplace</a> (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The famous mathematician <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Lagrange">Lagrange</a> was also a friend of the Cauchy family.

On Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Centrale%20du%20Panth%C3%A9on">École Centrale du Panthéon</a>, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802. Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and Humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>.

In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted. One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20des%20Ponts%20et%20Chauss%C3%A9es">École des Ponts et Chaussées</a> (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.

After finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the "Première Classe" (First Class) of the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a>. Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on <a href="regular%20polyhedron">polyhedra</a>) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of <a href="conic%20sections">conic sections</a>) was rejected.

In September 1812, now 23 years old, after becoming ill from overwork, Cauchy returned to Paris. Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of <a href="symmetric%20functions">symmetric functions</a>, the <a href="symmetric%20group">symmetric group</a> and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king <a href="Louis%20XVIII">Louis XVIII</a> took the restoration in hand. The <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Sciences">Académie des Sciences</a> was re-established in March 1816; <a href="Lazare%20Carnot">Lazare Carnot</a> and <a href="Gaspard%20Monge">Gaspard Monge</a> were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction by Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered his acceptance of membership of the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.

In November 1815, <a href="Louis%20Poinsot">Louis Poinsot</a>, who was an associate professor at the École Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Fermat</a>'s <a href="polygonal%20number%20theorem">polygonal number theorem</a>. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor.

When Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Aloïse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works. Aloïse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Françoise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy, who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and Eugène François Cauchy, a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.

The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother <a href="Charles%20X">Charles X</a>. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross appointments at the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>, and the .

In July 1830<a href="July%20Revolution">, France underwent another revolution</a>. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king <a href="Louis-Philippe">Louis-Philippe</a> (of the <a href="House%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">House of Orléans</a>). Riots, in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris.

These events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind. He spent a short time at <a href="Fribourg">Fribourg</a> in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the <a href="King%20of%20Sardinia">King of Sardinia</a> (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832–1833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>, and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>.

In August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux <a href="Henri%20d%27Artois">Henri d'Artois</a> (1820–1883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X. As a professor of the École Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.

During his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to <a href="Baron">Baron</a>, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.

Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838. He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance. However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science.
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the <a href="Bureau%20des%20Longitudes">Bureau des Longitudes</a>. This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could "forget" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea – mainly the <a href="longitude">longitudinal</a> coordinate, since <a href="latitude">latitude</a> is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.

In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the <a href="signed-digit%20representation">signed-digit representation</a> of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by <a href="John%20Colson">John Colson</a>. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.

Throughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20%C3%89ccl%C3%A9siastique">École Normale Écclésiastique</a>, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the <a href="Institut%20Catholique">Institut Catholique</a>. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported <a href="the%20Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a> ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.

The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Louis Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a>.

Not unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67. He received the <a href="Last%20Rites">Last Rites</a> and died at 4 a.m. on May 23, 1857.

His name is one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%2072%20names%20on%20the%20Eiffel%20Tower">72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower</a>.

The genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the <a href="problem%20of%20Apollonius">problem of Apollonius</a>—describing a <a href="circle">circle</a> touching three given circles—which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of <a href="Euler%20characteristic">Euler's formula</a> on <a href="polyhedra">polyhedra</a> in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on <a href="wave">wave</a> propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of <a href="limit%20of%20a%20sequence">convergence</a> and discovered many of the basic formulas for <a href="q-series">q-series</a>. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.

In the theory of light he worked on <a href="Augustin-Jean%20Fresnel">Fresnel's</a> wave theory and on the <a href="dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a> and <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> of light. He also contributed significant research in <a href="mechanics">mechanics</a>, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> of numbers that is now known as the <a href="Cauchy%20stress%20tensor">Cauchy stress tensor</a>. In <a href="Elasticity%20%28physics%29">elasticity</a>, he originated the theory of <a href="stress%20%28physics%29">stress</a>, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of <a href="Sim%C3%A9on%20Poisson">Siméon Poisson</a>.

Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the <a href="Fermat%20polygonal%20number%20theorem">Fermat polygonal number theorem</a>.

Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of <a href="complex%20function%20theory">complex function theory</a>. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as "<a href="Cauchy%27s%20integral%20theorem">Cauchy's integral theorem</a>", was the following:

where "f"("z") is a complex-valued function <a href="holomorphic%20function">holomorphic</a> on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve "C" (contour) lying in the <a href="complex%20plane">complex plane</a>. The "contour integral" is taken along the contour "C". The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Académie des Sciences (then still called "First Class of the Institute") on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825. The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics.

In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a <a href="residue%20%28mathematics%29">residue</a> of a function. This concept regards functions that have <a href="pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29">pole</a>s—isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function "f"("z") can be expanded in the <a href="neighborhood">neighborhood</a> of a singularity "a" as

where φ("z") is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then "f" is said to have a pole of order "n" in the point "a". If "n" = 1, the pole is called simple.
The coefficient "B" is called by Cauchy the residue of function "f" at "a". If "f" is non-singular at "a" then the residue of "f" is zero at "a". Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to,
where we replaced "B" by the modern notation of the residue.

In 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first he proposed the formula now known as <a href="Cauchy%27s%20integral%20formula">Cauchy's integral formula</a>,
where "f"("z") is analytic on "C" and within the region bounded by the contour "C" and the complex number "a" is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at "z" = "a". In the second paper he presented the <a href="residue%20theorem">residue theorem</a>,
where the sum is over all the "n" poles of "f"("z") on and within the contour "C". These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with <a href="Pierre-Alphonse%20Laurent">Pierre-Alphonse Laurent</a> being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a substantial contribution (his <a href="Laurent%20series">Laurent series</a> published in 1843).

 In his book "Cours d'Analyse" Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. "Rigor" in this case meant the rejection of the principle of "<a href="Generality%20of%20algebra">Generality of algebra</a>" (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s. Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was "the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe." The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and formula_6 arguments were introduced into Calculus. Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: "The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself."

M. Barany claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement . Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to "Analyse Algébrique" was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus . Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.

Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero. There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of "infinitesimally small quantities", arguing they lead from everything from the usual "epsilontic" definitions or to the notions of <a href="non-standard%20analysis">non-standard analysis</a>. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used. 

He was the first to prove <a href="Taylor%27s%20theorem">Taylor's theorem</a> rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder. He wrote a textbook (see the illustration) for his students at the École Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a <a href="limit%20of%20a%20function">limit</a> in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for <a href="absolute%20convergence">absolute convergence</a> stems from this book: <a href="Cauchy%20condensation%20test">Cauchy condensation test</a>. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook. In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods; thus one of his theorems was exposed to a "counter-example" by <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Abel</a>, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of <a href="uniform%20continuity">uniform continuity</a>.

In a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the "<a href="Argument%20principle">Argument Principle</a>" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the <a href="Cauchy%20argument%20principle">Cauchy argument principle</a> is quite frequently used to derive the <a href="Nyquist%20stability%20criterion">Nyquist stability criterion</a>, which can be used to predict the stability of negative <a href="feedback%20amplifier">feedback amplifier</a> and negative <a href="feedback">feedback</a> control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.

Cauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>. It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes:
His greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises:
His other works include:

Augustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his father flee with the family to <a href="Arcueil">Arcueil</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis François, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis François to his mother in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> says:

In any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.

He was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the <a href="Society%20of%20Saint%20Vincent%20de%20Paul">Society of Saint Vincent de Paul</a>. He also had links to the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for <a href="Charles%20Hermite">Charles Hermite</a> during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the <a href="Great%20Irish%20Famine">Potato Famine</a>.

His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a> called him a "bigoted Catholic" and added he was "mad and there is nothing that can be done about him", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when <a href="Guglielmo%20Libri%20Carucci%20dalla%20Sommaja">Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja</a> was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by <a href="Joseph%20Liouville">Joseph Liouville</a> rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned <a href="Jean%20Marie%20Constant%20Duhamel">Jean Marie Constant Duhamel</a> and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by <a href="Jean-Victor%20Poncelet">Jean-Victor Poncelet</a>, to be wrong.

Archimedes

Archimedes of Syracuse (; ; ) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> <a href="Greek%20mathematics">mathematician</a>, <a href="physics">physicist</a>, <a href="engineering">engineer</a>, <a href="inventor">inventor</a>, and <a href="astronomy">astronomer</a>. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading <a href="scientist">scientist</a>s in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern <a href="calculus">calculus</a> and <a href="mathematical%20analysis">analysis</a> by applying concepts of <a href="infinitesimals">infinitesimals</a> and the <a href="method%20of%20exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a> to derive and rigorously prove a range of <a href="geometry">geometrical</a> <a href="theorem">theorem</a>s, including the <a href="area">area</a> of a <a href="circle">circle</a>, the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> and <a href="volume">volume</a> of a <a href="sphere">sphere</a>, and the area under a <a href="parabola">parabola</a>.

Other mathematical achievements include deriving an accurate approximation of <a href="pi">pi</a>, defining and investigating the <a href="Archimedes%20spiral">spiral</a> bearing his name, and creating a system using <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a> for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, founding <a href="Fluid%20statics">hydrostatics</a> and <a href="statics">statics</a>, including an explanation of the principle of the <a href="lever">lever</a>. He is credited with designing innovative <a href="machine">machine</a>s, such as his <a href="Archimedes%27%20screw">screw pump</a>, <a href="block%20and%20tackle">compound pulleys</a>, and defensive war machines to protect his native <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> from invasion.

Archimedes died during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Syracuse%20%28214%E2%80%93212%20BC%29">Siege of Syracuse</a> when he was killed by a <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a>, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.

Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until by <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a> in <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <a href="Eutocius%20of%20Ascalon">Eutocius</a> in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, while the discovery in 1906 of previously unknown works by Archimedes in the <a href="Archimedes%20Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a> has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.

Archimedes was born "c". 287 BC in the seaport city of <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse, Sicily</a>, at that time a self-governing <a href="Colonies%20in%20antiquity">colony</a> in <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a>, located along the coast of <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a>. The date of birth is based on a statement by the <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantine Greek</a> historian <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a> that Archimedes lived for 75 years. In "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>", Archimedes gives his father's name as Phidias, an <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> about whom nothing is known. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> wrote in his "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>" that Archimedes was related to King <a href="Hiero%20II%20of%20Syracuse">Hiero II</a>, the ruler of Syracuse. A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost, leaving the details of his life obscure. It is unknown, for instance, whether he ever married or had children. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, where <a href="Conon%20of%20Samos">Conon of Samos</a> and <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes of Cyrene</a> were contemporaries. He referred to Conon of Samos as his friend, while two of his works ("<a href="Archimedes%27%20use%20of%20infinitesimals">The Method of Mechanical Theorems</a>" and the "<a href="Archimedes%27%20cattle%20problem">Cattle Problem</a>") have introductions addressed to Eratosthenes.

Archimedes died "c". 212 BC during the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>, when Roman forces under General <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long <a href="siege">siege</a>. According to the popular account given by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Archimedes was contemplating a <a href="mathematical%20diagram">mathematical diagram</a> when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed. Marcellus called Archimedes "a geometrical <a href="Hekatonkheires%23Hesiod">Briareus</a>".
The last words attributed to Archimedes are "Do not disturb my circles", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier. This quote is often given in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as ""<a href="Noli%20turbare%20circulos%20meos">Noli turbare circulos meos</a>"," but there is no reliable evidence that Archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by Plutarch. <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a>, writing in "Memorable Doings and Sayings" in the 1st century AD, gives the phrase as ""...sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli' inquit, 'obsecro, istum disturbare"'" - "... but protecting the dust with his hands, said 'I beg of you, do not disturb this. The phrase is also given in <a href="Katharevousa%20Greek">Katharevousa Greek</a> as "μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε!" ("Mē mou tous kuklous taratte!").

The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a <a href="sphere">sphere</a> and a <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75 BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman <a href="orator">orator</a> <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> was serving as <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a> in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.

The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a> in his "Universal History" was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and <a href="Livy">Livy</a>. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.

The most widely known <a href="anecdote">anecdote</a> about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a>, a <a href="votive%20crown">votive crown</a> for a temple had been made for King Hiero II, who had supplied the pure <a href="gold">gold</a> to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some <a href="silver">silver</a> had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its <a href="density">density</a>.
While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the <a href="volume">volume</a> of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible, so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying "<a href="Eureka%20%28word%29">Eureka</a>!" (, "heúrēka"!", meaning "I have found [it]!"). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in.

The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement. Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in <a href="fluid%20statics">hydrostatics</a> as <a href="Archimedes%27%20principle">Archimedes' principle</a>, which he describes in his treatise "On Floating Bodies". This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a <a href="buoyancy">buoyant force</a> equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly. <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> considered it "probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself." In a 12th-century text titled "Mappae clavicula" there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used, and thus solve the problem. The Latin poem "Carmen de ponderibus et mensuris" of the 4th or 5th century describes the use of a hydrostatic balance to solve the problem of the crown, and attributes the method to Archimedes.

A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a> described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the "<a href="Syracusia">Syracusia</a>", which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The "Syracusia" is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity. According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> and a temple dedicated to the goddess <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the <a href="Archimedes%27%20screw">Archimedes' screw</a> was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes' screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain. The Archimedes' screw described in Roman times by <a href="Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the <a href="Hanging%20Gardens%20of%20Babylon">Hanging Gardens of Babylon</a>. The world's first seagoing <a href="steamboat">steamship</a> with a <a href="propeller">screw propeller</a> was the <a href="SS%20Archimedes">SS "Archimedes"</a>, which was launched in 1839 and named in honor of Archimedes and his work on the screw.

The <a href="Claw%20of%20Archimedes">Claw of Archimedes</a> is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as "the ship shaker," the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled "Superweapons of the Ancient World" built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.

Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a <a href="parabolic%20reflector">parabolic reflector</a> to burn ships attacking <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>.
The 2nd century AD author <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a> wrote that during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Syracuse%20%28212%20BC%29">Siege of Syracuse</a> ("c." 214–212 BC), Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, <a href="Anthemius%20of%20Tralles">Anthemius of Tralles</a> mentions <a href="burning-glass">burning-glass</a>es as Archimedes' weapon. The device, sometimes called the "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may be referred to as a <a href="heliostat">heliostat</a> or <a href="solar%20furnace">solar furnace</a>.

This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> rejected it as false, while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes. It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished <a href="bronze">bronze</a> or <a href="copper">copper</a> shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship.

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the <a href="Skaramagas">Skaramagas</a> naval base outside <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1 m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet (50 m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of <a href="bitumen">tar</a> paint, which may have aided combustion. A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era.

In October 2005 a group of students from the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30 cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a wooden ship at a range of around 100 feet (30 m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show "<a href="MythBusters">MythBusters</a>", using a wooden fishing boat in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its <a href="autoignition%20temperature">autoignition temperature</a>, which is around 300 °C (570 °F).

When "MythBusters" broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of "busted" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. "MythBusters" also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.

In December 2010, "MythBusters" again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition entitled "President's Challenge". Several experiments were carried out, including a large scale test with 500 schoolchildren aiming mirrors at a of a Roman sailing ship 400 feet (120 m) away. In all of the experiments, the sail failed to reach the 210 °C (410 °F) required to catch fire, and the verdict was again "busted". The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding, <a href="Glare%20%28vision%29">dazzling</a>, or distracting the crew of the ship.

While Archimedes did not invent the <a href="lever">lever</a>, he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work "On the Equilibrium of Planes". Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a> of the followers of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and are sometimes attributed to <a href="Archytas">Archytas</a>. According to <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a>, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." () Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed <a href="block%20and%20tackle">block-and-tackle</a> <a href="pulley">pulley</a> systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of <a href="lever">lever</a>age to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the <a href="catapult">catapult</a>, and with inventing the <a href="odometer">odometer</a> during the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a>. The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> (106–43 BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> "<a href="De%20re%20publica">De re publica</a>", which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC. After the capture of Syracuse "c." 212 BC, General <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by <a href="Thales">Thales of Miletus</a> and <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a>. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by <a href="Gaius%20Sulpicius%20Gallus">Gaius Sulpicius Gallus</a> to <a href="Lucius%20Furius%20Philus">Lucius Furius Philus</a>, who described it thus:

This is a description of a <a href="planetarium">planetarium</a> or <a href="orrery">orrery</a>. <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript (now lost) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled . Modern research in this area has been focused on the <a href="Antikythera%20mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>, another device built  BC that was probably designed for the same purpose. Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of <a href="Differential%20%28mechanical%20device%29">differential gearing</a>. This was once thought to have been beyond the range of the technology available in ancient times, but the discovery of the Antikythera mechanism in 1902 has confirmed that devices of this kind were known to the ancient Greeks.

While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices, Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> wrote: "He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life."
Archimedes was able to use <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s in a way that is similar to modern <a href="Integral">integral calculus</a>. Through proof by contradiction (<a href="reductio%20ad%20absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the <a href="method%20of%20exhaustion">method of exhaustion</a>, and he employed it to approximate the value of π. In "<a href="Measurement%20of%20a%20Circle">Measurement of a Circle</a>" he did this by drawing a larger <a href="regular%20hexagon">regular hexagon</a> outside a <a href="circle">circle</a> and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of π lay between 3 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the <a href="area">area</a> of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the <a href="square">square</a> of the <a href="radius">radius</a> of the circle (πr). In "<a href="On%20the%20Sphere%20and%20Cylinder">On the Sphere and Cylinder</a>", Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude. This is the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a> of real numbers.
In "Measurement of a Circle", Archimedes gives the value of the <a href="square%20root">square root</a> of 3 as lying between (approximately 1.7320261) and (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused <a href="John%20Wallis">John Wallis</a> to remark that he was: "as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results." It is possible that he used an <a href="iteration">iterative</a> procedure to calculate these values.

In "<a href="The%20Quadrature%20of%20the%20Parabola">The Quadrature of the Parabola</a>", Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a <a href="parabola">parabola</a> and a straight line is times the area of a corresponding inscribed <a href="triangle">triangle</a> as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29%23History%20of%20the%20theory%20of%20infinite%20series">infinite</a> <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a> with the <a href="Geometric%20series%23Common%20ratio">common ratio</a> :

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller <a href="secant%20line">secant line</a>s, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series which sums to .

In "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>", Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: "There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of <a href="Hiero%20II%20of%20Syracuse">Hiero II</a>), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited." To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the <a href="myriad">myriad</a>. The word is from the Greek "murias", for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 <a href="Names%20of%20large%20numbers">vigintillion</a>, or 8.

The works of Archimedes were written in <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric Greek</a>, the dialect of ancient <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a>. The written work of Archimedes has not survived as well as that of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>, and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them by other authors. <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> mentions "<a href="On%20Sphere-Making">On Sphere-Making</a>" and another work on <a href="polyhedron">polyhedra</a>, while <a href="Theon%20of%20Alexandria">Theon of Alexandria</a> quotes a remark about <a href="refraction">refraction</a> from the "Catoptrica". During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> Greek architect <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a> ("c". 530 AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by <a href="Eutocius%20of%20Ascalon">Eutocius</a> in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by <a href="Th%C4%81bit%20ibn%20Qurra">Thābit ibn Qurra</a> (836–901 AD), and Latin by <a href="Gerard%20of%20Cremona">Gerard of Cremona</a> ("c." 1114–1187 AD). During the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, the "Editio Princeps" (First Edition) was published in <a href="Basel">Basel</a> in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin. Around the year 1586 <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.





Archimedes' "<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Lemmas">pageRank.Book of Lemmas</a>" or "Liber Assumptorum" is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. The scholars <a href="T.%20L.%20Heath">T. L. Heath</a> and <a href="Marshall%20Clagett">Marshall Clagett</a> argued that it cannot have been written by Archimedes in its current form, since it quotes Archimedes, suggesting modification by another author. The "Lemmas" may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost.

It has also been claimed that <a href="Heron%27s%20formula">Heron's formula</a> for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes. However, the first reliable reference to the formula is given by <a href="Hero%20of%20Alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</a> in the 1st century AD.

The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the <a href="Archimedes%20Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a>. In 1906, the Danish professor <a href="Johan%20Ludvig%20Heiberg%20%28historian%29">Johan Ludvig Heiberg</a> visited <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a <a href="palimpsest">palimpsest</a>, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as <a href="vellum">vellum</a> was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of "On Floating Bodies" in the original Greek. It is the only known source of "The Method of Mechanical Theorems", referred to by <a href="Suda">Suidas</a> and thought to have been lost forever. "Stomachion" was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the <a href="Walters%20Art%20Museum">Walters Art Museum</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> and <a href="light">light</a> to read the overwritten text.

The treatises in the Archimedes Palimpsest are: "On the Equilibrium of Planes, On Spirals, <a href="Measurement%20of%20a%20Circle">Measurement of a Circle</a>, On the Sphere and the Cylinder, On Floating Bodies, The Method of Mechanical Theorems" and "Stomachion".



a. In the preface to "On Spirals" addressed to Dositheus of Pelusium, Archimedes says that "many years have elapsed since Conon's death." <a href="Conon%20of%20Samos">Conon of Samos</a> lived , suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works.

b. The treatises by Archimedes known to exist only through references in the works of other authors are: "<a href="On%20Sphere-Making">On Sphere-Making</a>" and a work on polyhedra mentioned by Pappus of Alexandria; "Catoptrica", a work on optics mentioned by <a href="Theon%20of%20Alexandria">Theon of Alexandria</a>; "Principles", addressed to Zeuxippus and explaining the number system used in "<a href="The%20Sand%20Reckoner">The Sand Reckoner</a>"; "On Balances and Levers"; "On Centers of Gravity"; "On the Calendar".

Alternative medicine

Alternative medicine – or fringe medicine – includes practices claimed to have the <a href="healing">healing</a> effects of <a href="medicine">medicine</a> but which are disproven, unproven, impossible to prove, or are excessively harmful in relation to their effect; and where the <a href="scientific%20consensus">scientific consensus</a> is that the therapy does not, or cannot, work because the known <a href="Scientific%20law">laws of nature</a> are violated by its basic claims; or where it is considered so much worse than conventional treatment that it would be <a href="medical%20ethics">unethical</a> to offer as treatment. Alternative therapies or diagnoses are not part of <a href="medicine">medicine</a> or <a href="science">science-based</a> healthcare systems. Alternative medicine consists of a wide variety of practices, products, and therapies – ranging from those that are <a href="biologically%20plausible">biologically plausible</a> but not well tested, to those with known harmful and <a href="Toxicity">toxic</a> effects. Contrary to popular belief, significant expense is paid to test alternative medicine, including over $2.5 billion spent by the United States government. Almost none show any effect beyond that of <a href="Placebo">false treatment</a>. Perceived effects of alternative medicine may be caused by <a href="placebo">placebo</a>; decreased effect of functional treatment (and therefore potentially decreased <a href="side%20effects">side effects</a>); and <a href="regression%20toward%20the%20mean">regression toward the mean</a> where improvement that would have occurred anyway is <a href="Regression%20fallacy">credited</a> to alternative therapies; or any combination of the above. Alternative treatments are not the same as <a href="Medical%20research">experimental medicine</a> or <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>, although much of the latter is alternative when used today.

Alternative medicine has grown in popularity and is used by a significant percentage of the population in many countries. While it has extensively rebranded itself: from quackery to complementary or integrative medicine – it promotes essentially the same practices. Newer proponents often suggest alternative medicine be used together with functional medical treatment, in a <a href="belief">belief</a> that it "complements" (improves the effect of, or mitigates the side effects of) the treatment. There is no evidence showing they do so, and significant <a href="drug%20interaction">drug interaction</a>s caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively influence treatments, making them less effective, notably <a href="Treatment%20of%20cancer">cancer therapy</a>. Despite being illegal to market alternative therapies for cancer treatment in most of the developed world, many cancer patients use them.

Alternative medicine is criticized for being based on misleading statements, <a href="quackery">quackery</a>, <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, <a href="antiscience">antiscience</a>, <a href="fraud">fraud</a>, or poor <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>ology. Promoting alternative medicine has been called dangerous and <a href="ethics">unethical</a>. Testing alternative medicine that has no scientific basis has been called a waste of scarce research resources. Critics state "there is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't", and the problem with the idea of "alternative" treatments in this sense is that the "underlying logic is magical, childish or downright absurd". It has been strongly suggested that the very idea of any alternative treatment that works is <a href="paradox">paradox</a>ical, as any treatment proven to work is by definition "medicine".
Practitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect – a well-established observation in medicine. Related to it are similar psychological effects, such as the will to believe, <a href="cognitive%20bias">cognitive bias</a>es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning, and the "<a href="post%20hoc%2C%20ergo%20propter%20hoc">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</a>" fallacy.

CAM's popularity may be related to other factors that <a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> mentioned in an interview in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>":

Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. "People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. "At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.

<a href="Paul%20Offit">Paul Offit</a> proposed that "alternative medicine becomes quackery" in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients' bank accounts, or by promoting "magical thinking."

In a paper published in October 2010 entitled "The public's enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine", Ernst described these views in greater detail and concluded:

[CAM] is popular. An analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor. Providers of CAM tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals. In turn, this implies that much of the popularity of CAM is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare. We should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients.

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them "in lieu" of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of <a href="scientific%20literacy">scientific literacy</a> among the public at large and a concomitant increase in <a href="antiscience">antiscientific</a> attitudes and <a href="new%20age">new age</a> <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>. Related to this are vigorous <a href="marketing">marketing</a> of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.

There is also an increase in <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a> toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments. Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public <a href="health%20insurance">health insurance</a>, which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine. Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.

Patients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous <a href="adverse%20effect">side effects</a> of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as <a href="cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="HIV">HIV</a> infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a> can have potential to cause life-threatening <a href="anaphylactic">anaphylactic</a> reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.

Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, but whose <a href="efficacy">effectiveness</a> has not been clearly established using <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>s, or whose theory and practice is not part of <a href="biomedicine">biomedicine</a>, or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by <a href="scientific%20evidence">scientific evidence</a> or <a href="science">scientific principles</a> used in biomedicine. "Biomedicine" or "medicine" is that part of <a href="medical%20science">medical science</a> that applies principles of <a href="biology">biology</a>, <a href="physiology">physiology</a>, <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, <a href="biophysics">biophysics</a>, and other <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a>s to <a href="clinical%20practice">clinical practice</a>, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine, an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methodology, but may instead be based on <a href="testimonial">testimonial</a>s, <a href="religion">religion</a>, tradition, <a href="superstition">superstition</a>, belief in <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> energies, <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, <a href="fallacy">errors in reasoning</a>, <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, <a href="fraud">fraud</a>, or other unscientific sources.

In "General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine", published in 2000 by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), complementary and alternative medicine were defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system.

The expression also refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful.

The terms"-Alternative medicine", "complementary medicine", "integrative medicine," "holistic medicine", "natural medicine", "unorthodox medicine", "fringe medicine", "unconventional medicine", and "<a href="new%20age">new age</a> medicine" are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in some contexts, but may have different meanings in some rare cases.

The meaning of the term "alternative" in the expression "alternative medicine", is not that it is an effective alternative to <a href="medical%20science">medical science</a>, although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness. Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions "western medicine" and "eastern medicine" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> and treatments that don't work.

Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a <a href="belief">belief</a> that it improves the effect of treatments. However, significant <a href="drug%20interaction">drug interaction</a>s caused by alternative therapies may instead negatively influence treatment, making treatments less effective, notably <a href="Treatment%20of%20cancer">cancer therapy</a>. Both terms refer to use of alternative medical treatments alongside conventional medicine, an example of which is use of <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a> (sticking needles in the body to influence the flow of a supernatural energy), along with using science-based medicine, in the belief that the acupuncture increases the effectiveness or "complements" the science-based medicine.

Allopathic medicine or allopathy is an expression commonly used by <a href="Homeopathy">homeopaths</a> and proponents of other forms of alternative medicine to refer to <a href="medicine">mainstream medicine</a>. Specifically it refers to the use of pharmacologically active <a href="Active%20ingredient">agents</a> or <a href="Surgery">physical interventions</a> to treat or suppress <a href="symptoms">symptoms</a> or <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiologic</a> processes of diseases or conditions. The German version of the word, , was coined in 1810 by the creator of <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Hahnemann">Samuel Hahnemann</a> (1755–1843). The word was coined from (different) and (relating to a disease or to a method of treatment). In alternative medicine circles the expression "allopathic medicine" is still used to refer to "the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, <a href="biomedicine">biomedicine</a>, <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>, or modern medicine" (see the article on <a href="scientific%20medicine">scientific medicine</a>).

Use of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other alternative medicine practices. The meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is considered pejorative. More recently, some sources have used the term "allopathic", particularly American sources wishing to distinguish between <a href="Comparison%20of%20MD%20and%20DO%20in%20the%20United%20States">Doctors of Medicine (MD) and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) in the United States</a>. William Jarvis, an expert on alternative medicine and public health, states that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was from the start "considered highly derisive by regular medicine".

Many conventional medical treatments clearly do not fit the nominal definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove its cause.

CAM is an abbreviation of complementary and alternative medicine. It has also been called sCAM or SCAM with the addition of "so-called" or "supplements". The words balance and holism are often used, claiming to take into account a "whole" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine. Due to its many names the field has been criticized for intense <a href="rebranding">rebranding</a> of what are essentially the same practices: as soon as one name is declared synonymous with <a href="quackery">quackery</a>, a new name is chosen.

Traditional medicine refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, contrary to what is typically practiced in other cultures where medical science dominates.

"<a href="Eastern%20medicine">Eastern medicine</a>" typically refers to the traditional medicines of Asia where conventional bio-medicine penetrated much later.

Prominent members of the science and biomedical science community say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, that the expressions "conventional medicine", "alternative medicine", "complementary medicine", "integrative medicine", and "holistic medicine" do not refer to any medicine at all.

Others in both the biomedical and CAM communities say that CAM "cannot" be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between CAM and biomedicine overlap, are porous, and change. The expression "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) resists easy definition because the health systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined. Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnostic technique</a>, <a href="therapy">therapeutic practice</a> and in their relationship to the medical mainstream. Some alternative therapies, including <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)</a> and <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a>, have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems; others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some, such as <a href="osteopathy">osteopathy</a> and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as <a href="meditation">meditation</a> and <a href="prayer">prayer</a>, are based on <a href="mind-body%20intervention">mind-body intervention</a>s. Treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another. Thus, chiropractic is not considered alternative in Denmark and likewise <a href="Osteopathic%20medicine%20in%20the%20United%20States">osteopathic medicine</a> is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy in the United States.

Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that "complementary" is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a <a href="placebo">placebo</a>.

One common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as "other than" conventional medicine. For example, the widely referenced descriptive definition of complementary and alternative medicine devised by the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Alternative%20Medicine">US National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)</a> of the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, states that it is "a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine". For conventional medical practitioners, it does not necessarily follow that either it or its practitioners would no longer be considered alternative.

Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare. This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from the medical establishment and related bodies regarding access to <a href="Medical%20research%23Funding">research funding</a>, sympathetic coverage in the <a href="Medical%20literature">medical press</a>, or inclusion in the standard <a href="Medical%20education">medical curriculum</a>. In 1993, the <a href="British%20Medical%20Association">British Medical Association (BMA)</a>, one among many professional organizations who have attempted to define alternative medicine, stated that it referred to "...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses". In a US context, an influential definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician, David M. Eisenberg, characterized alternative medicine "as interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals". These descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and CAM introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training; alternative medicine is taught in more than 50 per cent of <a href="Medical%20school%20in%20the%20United%20States">US medical schools</a> and increasingly <a href="Health%20insurance%20in%20the%20United%20States">US health insurers</a> are willing to provide reimbursement for CAM therapies. In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of CAM therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008.

An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM), devised a <a href="theoretical%20definition">theoretical definition</a> of alternative medicine as "a broad domain of healing resources ... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period". This definition has been widely adopted by CAM researchers, cited by official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health, attributed as the definition used by the <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a>, and, with some modification, was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Medicine">US Institute of Medicine</a>, "Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States".

The 1995 OAM conference definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies. Its proponents hold that it thus avoids <a href="relativism">relativism</a> about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream <a href="biomedicine">biomedicine</a> is solely due to political forces. According to this definition, alternative and <a href="medicine">mainstream medicine</a> can only be differentiated with reference to what is "intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture". However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and <a href="subculture">subculture</a>s, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity. If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population.

<a href="Normative">Normative</a> definitions distinguish alternative medicine from the biomedical mainstream in its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis. These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>, they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on <a href="evidence">evidence</a> gathered with the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>. Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by <a href="Marcia%20Angell">Marcia Angell</a>, a former editor of "<a href="The%20New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">The New England Journal of Medicine</a>", argued that:

It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.

This line of division has been subject to criticism, however, as not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit, and it is also unlikely in most instances that conventional therapies, if proven to be ineffective, would ever be classified as CAM.

Similarly, the public information website maintained by the <a href="National%20Health%20and%20Medical%20Research%20Council">National Health and Medical Research Council</a> (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym "CAM" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements.

The <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Health%20%28Denmark%29">Danish National Board of Health's</a> "Council for Alternative Medicine" (Sundhedsstyrelsens Råd for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: "Sundhedsstyrelsen"), uses the term "alternative medicine" for:


Proponents of an <a href="Evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-base for medicine</a> such as the Cochrane Collaboration (founded in 1993 and from 2011 providing input for WHO resolutions) take a position that "all" systematic reviews of treatments, whether "mainstream" or "alternative", ought to be held to the current standards of scientific method. In a study titled "Development and classification of an operational definition of complementary and alternative medicine for the Cochrane Collaboration" (2011) it was proposed that indicators that a therapy is accepted include government licensing of practitioners, coverage by <a href="health%20insurance">health insurance</a>, statements of approval by government agencies, and recommendation as part of a practice guideline; and that if something is currently a standard, accepted therapy, then it is not likely to be widely considered as CAM.

A United States government agency, the National Center on Complementary and Integrative Health (<a href="NCCIH">NCCIH</a>), created its own classification system for branches of complementary and alternative medicine that divides them into five major groups. These groups have some overlap, and distinguish two types of energy medicine: "veritable" which involves scientifically observable <a href="energy">energy</a> (including <a href="magnet%20therapy">magnet therapy</a>, <a href="colorpuncture">colorpuncture</a> and <a href="light%20therapy">light therapy</a>) and "putative", which invokes physically undetectable or unverifiable energy.

The NCCIH classification system is - 

Alternative medicine consists of a wide range of health care practices, products, and therapies. The shared feature is a claim to heal that is not based on the scientific method. Alternative medicine practices are diverse in their foundations and methodologies. Alternative medicine practices may be classified by their cultural origins or by the types of beliefs upon which they are based. Methods may incorporate or be based on traditional medicinal practices of a particular culture, folk knowledge, superstition, spiritual beliefs, belief in <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> energies (<a href="antiscience">antiscience</a>), <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, <a href="fallacy">errors in reasoning</a>, propaganda, fraud, new or different concepts of health and disease, and any bases other than being proven by scientific methods. Different cultures may have their own unique traditional or belief based practices developed recently or over thousands of years, and specific practices or entire systems of practices.

Alternative medicine, such as using <a href="naturopathy">naturopathy</a> or <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a> in place of <a href="conventional%20medicine">conventional medicine</a>, is based on belief systems not grounded in science.

Alternative medical systems may be based on <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> practices, such as <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> (TCM), <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a> in India, or practices of other cultures around the world. Some useful applications of traditional medicines have been researched and accepted within ordinary medicine, however the underlying belief systems are seldom scientific and are not accepted.

Bases of belief may include belief in existence of supernatural energies undetected by the science of physics, as in biofields, or in belief in properties of the energies of physics that are inconsistent with the laws of physics, as in energy medicine.

Substance based practices use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, non-vitamin supplements and megavitamins, animal and fungal products, and minerals, including use of these products in traditional medical practices that may also incorporate other methods. Examples include healing claims for nonvitamin supplements, <a href="fish%20oil">fish oil</a>, <a href="Omega-3%20fatty%20acid">Omega-3 fatty acid</a>, <a href="glucosamine">glucosamine</a>, <a href="echinacea">echinacea</a>, <a href="flaxseed%20oil">flaxseed oil</a>, and <a href="ginseng">ginseng</a>. <a href="Herbal%20medicine">Herbal medicine</a>, or <a href="phytotherapy">phytotherapy</a>, includes not just the use of plant products, but may also include the use of animal and mineral products. It is among the most commercially successful branches of alternative medicine, and includes the tablets, powders and elixirs that are sold as "nutritional supplements". Only a very small percentage of these have been shown to have any efficacy, and there is little regulation as to standards and safety of their contents. This may include use of known toxic substances, such as use of the poison <a href="lead">lead</a> in traditional Chinese medicine.

The <a href="history%20of%20alternative%20medicine">history of alternative medicine</a> may refer to the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as "alternative medicine" beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled "irregular practices" by the western medical establishment. It includes the histories of <a href="complementary%20medicine">complementary medicine</a> and of <a href="integrative%20medicine">integrative medicine</a>. Before the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the increasingly science-based medical establishment were referred to "irregular practitioners", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific and as practicing <a href="quackery">quackery</a>. Until the 1970's, irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as <a href="quackery">quackery</a> and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the entire group collectively marketed and promoted under the single expression "alternative medicine".

Use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise following the <a href="counterculture%20movement">counterculture movement</a> of the 1960s, as part of the rising <a href="new%20age%20movement">new age movement</a> of the 1970s. This was due to misleading <a href="mass%20marketing">mass marketing</a> of "alternative medicine" being an effective "alternative" to biomedicine, changing social attitudes about not using <a href="chemicals">chemicals</a> and challenging <a href="the%20establishment">the establishment</a> and <a href="authority">authority</a> of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to beliefs and practices of other cultures (<a href="cultural%20relativism">cultural relativism</a>), and growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and <a href="side%20effect">side effect</a>s of <a href="science-based%20medicine">science-based medicine</a>. At the same time, in 1975, the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a>, which played the central role in fighting quackery in the United States, abolished its quackery committee and closed down its Department of Investigation. By the early to mid 1970s the expression "alternative medicine" came into widespread use, and the expression became mass marketed as a collection of "natural" and effective treatment "alternatives" to science-based biomedicine. By 1983, mass marketing of "alternative medicine" was so pervasive that the <a href="British%20Medical%20Journal">British Medical Journal</a> (BMJ) pointed to "an apparently endless stream of books, articles, and radio and television programmes urge on the public the virtues of (alternative medicine) treatments ranging from meditation to drilling a hole in the skull to let in more oxygen". In this 1983 article, the BMJ wrote, "one of the few growth industries in contemporary Britain is alternative medicine", noting that by 1983, "33% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 39% of those with backache admitted to having consulted an alternative practitioner".

By about 1990, the American alternative medicine industry had grown to a $27 billion per year, with polls showing 30% of Americans were using it. Moreover, polls showed that Americans made more visits for alternative therapies than the total number of visits to primary care doctors, and American out-of-pocket spending (non-insurance spending) on alternative medicine was about equal to spending on biomedical doctors. In 1991, <a href="Time%20magazine">Time magazine</a> ran a cover story, "The New Age of Alternative Medicine: Why New Age Medicine Is Catching On". In 1993, the <a href="New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">New England Journal of Medicine</a> reported one in three Americans as using alternative medicine. In 1993, the <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20System">Public Broadcasting System</a> ran a <a href="Bill%20Moyers">Bill Moyers</a> special, <a href="Healing%20and%20the%20Mind">Healing and the Mind</a>, with Moyers commenting that "...people by the tens of millions are using alternative medicine. If established medicine does not understand that, they are going to lose their clients."

Another explosive growth began in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, investing large sums of government medical research funds into testing alternative medicine, including testing of scientifically implausible treatments, and relaxing government regulation of alternative medicine products as compared to biomedical products. Beginning with a 1991 appropriation of $2 million for funding research of alternative medicine research, federal spending grew to a cumulative total of about $2.5 billion by 2009, with 50% of Americans using alternative medicine by 2013.

In 1993, Britain's <a href="Prince%20Charles">Prince Charles</a>, who claimed that homeopathy and other alternative medicine was an effective alternative to biomedicine, established <a href="The%20Prince%27s%20Foundation%20for%20Integrated%20Health">The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health</a> (FIH), as a charity to explore "how safe, proven complementary therapies can work in conjunction with mainstream medicine". The FIH received government funding through grants from Britain's <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Health</a>. In 2008, London's "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" published a letter from <a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> that asked the FIH to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying: "the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous." In 2010, the FIH closed after allegations of fraud and money laundering led to arrests of its officials.

In 2001, <a href="MEDLINE">MEDLINE</a> introduced a <a href="MeSH">MeSH</a> term to index scientific publications in alternative medicine.

In 2004, modifications of the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>'s 2001 <a href="Directive%202001/83/EC">Directive 2001/83/EC</a>, regulating all medicine products, were made with the expectation of influencing development of the European market for alternative medicine products. Regulation of alternative medicine in Europe was loosened with "a simplified registration procedure" for traditional herbal medicinal products. Plausible "efficacy" for traditional medicine was redefined to be based on long term popularity and testimonials ("the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience."), without scientific testing. The <a href="Committee%20on%20Herbal%20Medicinal%20Products">Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products</a> (HMPC) was created within the <a href="European%20Medicines%20Agency">European Medicines Agency</a> in London (EMEA). A special working group was established for homeopathic remedies under the <a href="Heads%20of%20Medicines%20Agencies">Heads of Medicines Agencies</a>.

Through 2004, alternative medicine that was traditional to Germany continued to be a regular part of the health care system, including <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a> and <a href="anthroposophic%20medicine">anthroposophic medicine</a>. The <a href="German%20Medicines%20Act">German Medicines Act</a> mandated that science-based medical authorities consider the "particular characteristics" of complementary and alternative medicines. By 2004, homeopathy had grown to be the most used alternative therapy in France, growing from 16% of the population using homeopathic medicine in 1982, to 29% by 1987, 36% percent by 1992, and 62% of French mothers using homeopathic medicines by 2004, with 95% of French pharmacists advising pregnant women to use homeopathic remedies. , 100 million people in <a href="India">India</a> depended solely on traditional German homeopathic remedies for their medical care. , homeopathic remedies continued to be the leading alternative treatment used by European physicians. By 2005, sales of <a href="homeopathic%20remedies">homeopathic remedies</a> and <a href="anthroposophical%20medicine">anthroposophical medicine</a> had grown to $930 million Euros, a 60% increase from 1995.

Since 2009, according to Art. 118a of the <a href="Swiss%20Federal%20Constitution">Swiss Federal Constitution</a>, the Swiss Confederation and the <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">Cantons of Switzerland</a> shall within the scope of their powers ensure that consideration is given to complementary medicine.

By 2013, 50% of Americans were using CAM. , CAM medicinal products in Europe continued to be exempted from documented efficacy standards required of other medicinal products.

Much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent, complete medical systems. These were developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods. Each system was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre-scientific western medicine, or with each other's systems. Examples are <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> and the <a href="Ayurvedic%20medicine">Ayurvedic medicine</a> of <a href="India">India</a>.

Other alternative medicine practices, such as <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, were developed in western Europe and in opposition to western medicine, at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities. Homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water. But homeopathy, with its remedies made of water, was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time, which included use of <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s and <a href="bloodletting">draining of blood</a>, often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death.

Other alternative practices such as <a href="chiropractic">chiropractic</a> and <a href="osteopathic%20manipulative%20medicine">osteopathic manipulative medicine</a> were developed in the United States at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories, but the biomedical model was not yet totally dominant. Practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, each considered to be irregular practices by the western medical establishment, also opposed each other, both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation. Osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing, and licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field.

Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to "irregular practitioners", and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific, as practicing <a href="quackery">quackery</a>. The Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as <a href="quackery">quackery</a> and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments.

Dating from the 1970s, medical professionals, sociologists, anthropologists and other commentators noted the increasing visibility of a wide variety of health practices that had neither derived directly from nor been verified by <a href="medical%20research">biomedical science</a>. Since that time, those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field. A variety of terms have been used, including heterodox, irregular, fringe and alternative medicine while others, particularly medical commentators, have been satisfied to label them as instances of quackery. The most persistent term has been alternative medicine but its use is problematic as it assumes a value-laden dichotomy between a medical fringe, implicitly of borderline acceptability at best, and a privileged medical orthodoxy, associated with validated medico-scientific norms. The use of the category of alternative medicine has also been criticized as it cannot be studied as an independent entity but must be understood in terms of a regionally and temporally specific medical orthodoxy. Its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists. As with near-synonymous expressions, such as unorthodox, complementary, marginal, or quackery, these linguistic devices have served, in the context of processes of professionalisation and market competition, to establish the authority of official medicine and police the boundary between it and its unconventional rivals.

An early instance of the influence of this modern, or western, scientific medicine outside Europe and North America is <a href="Peking%20Union%20Medical%20College">Peking Union Medical College</a>.

From a historical perspective, the emergence of alternative medicine, if not the term itself, is typically dated to the 19th century. This is despite the fact that there are variants of Western non-conventional medicine that arose in the late-eighteenth century or earlier and some non-Western medical traditions, currently considered alternative in the West and elsewhere, which boast extended historical pedigrees. Alternative medical systems, however, can only be said to exist when there is an identifiable, regularized and authoritative standard medical practice, such as arose in the West during the nineteenth century, to which they can function as an alternative.

During the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of Europe and, as the nineteenth century progressed, most Western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi-protected medical markets. It is at this point that an "official" medicine, created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of <a href="Legitimation">legitimacy</a>, emerges as a recognizable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable.

As part of this process, professional adherents of mainstream medicine in countries such as Germany, France, and Britain increasingly invoked the scientific basis of their discipline as a means of engendering internal professional unity and of external differentiation in the face of sustained market competition from homeopaths, naturopaths, mesmerists and other nonconventional medical practitioners, finally achieving a degree of imperfect dominance through alliance with the state and the passage of regulatory legislation. In the US the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20School%20of%20Medicine">Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</a>, based in Baltimore, Maryland, opened in 1893, with <a href="William%20H.%20Welch">William H. Welch</a> and <a href="William%20Osler">William Osler</a> among the founding physicians, and was the first medical school devoted to teaching "German scientific medicine".

Buttressed by increased authority arising from significant advances in the medical sciences of the late 19th century onwards – including development and application of the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a> by the chemist <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> and the surgeon <a href="Joseph%20Lister%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lister">Joseph Lister</a>, of <a href="microbiology">microbiology</a> co-founded by <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a> (in 1885 appointed professor of <a href="hygiene">hygiene</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a>), and of the use of <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s (<a href="R%C3%B6ntgen%20ray">Röntgen ray</a>s)—the 1910 <a href="Flexner%20Report">Flexner Report</a> called upon <a href="Medical%20school%20in%20the%20United%20States">American medical schools</a> to follow the model of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and adhere to mainstream science in their teaching and research. This was in a belief, mentioned in the Report's introduction, that the preliminary and professional training then prevailing in medical schools should be reformed, in view of the new means for diagnosing and combating disease made available by the sciences on which medicine depended.

Putative medical practices at the time that later became known as "alternative medicine" included homeopathy (founded in Germany in the early 19th century) and chiropractic (founded in North America in the late 19th century). These conflicted in principle with the developments in medical science upon which the Flexner reforms were based, and they have not become compatible with further advances of medical science such as listed in <a href="Timeline%20of%20medicine%20and%20medical%20technology">Timeline of medicine and medical technology</a>, 1900–1999 and 2000–present, nor have Ayurveda, acupuncture or other kinds of alternative medicine.

At the same time "<a href="tropical%20medicine">tropical medicine</a>" was being developed as a specialist branch of western medicine in research establishments such as <a href="Liverpool%20School%20of%20Tropical%20Medicine">Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</a> founded in 1898 by <a href="Alfred%20Lewis%20Jones">Alfred Lewis Jones</a>, <a href="London%20School%20of%20Hygiene%20%26amp%3B%20Tropical%20Medicine">London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine</a>, founded in 1899 by <a href="Patrick%20Manson">Patrick Manson</a>, and <a href="Tulane%20University%20School%20of%20Public%20Health%20and%20Tropical%20Medicine">Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine</a>, instituted in 1912. A distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems. An example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in India, including Ayurveda, submitted by <a href="Mohammad%20Usman%20of%20Madras">Mohammad Usman of Madras</a> and others in 1923. This stated that the first question the Committee considered was "to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not".

By the later twentieth century the term "alternative medicine" entered public discourse, but it was not always being used with the same meaning by all parties. <a href="Arnold%20S.%20Relman">Arnold S. Relman</a> remarked in 1998 that in the best kind of medical practice, all proposed treatments must be tested objectively, and that in the end there will only be treatments that pass and those that do not, those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not. He asked "Can there be any reasonable 'alternative'?" But also in 1998 the then <a href="Surgeon%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Surgeon General of the United States</a>, <a href="David%20Satcher">David Satcher</a>, issued public information about eight common alternative treatments (including acupuncture, holistic and massage), together with information about common diseases and conditions, on nutrition, diet, and lifestyle changes, and about helping consumers to decipher fraud and quackery, and to find healthcare centers and doctors who practiced alternative medicine.

By 1990, approximately 60 million Americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues, according to a nationwide survey in the US published in 1993 by David Eisenberg. A study published in the November 11, 1998 issue of the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>" reported that 42% of Americans had used complementary and alternative therapies, up from 34% in 1990. However, despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine, most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed.

Mainly as a result of reforms following the Flexner Report of 1910 <a href="medical%20education">medical education</a> in established <a href="medical%20schools">medical schools</a> in the US has generally not included alternative medicine as a teaching topic. Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine, and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making). Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the <a href="pathophysiological">pathophysiological</a> basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.

By 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US. Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20Baltimore">University of Maryland, Baltimore</a> includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration). Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed <a href="physicians%20in%20the%20United%20States">physicians in the US</a> who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD). All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the <a href="United%20States%20Medical%20Licensing%20Examination">United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)</a>.

The British Medical Association, in its publication "Complementary Medicine, New Approach to Good Practice" (1993), gave as a working definition of non-conventional therapies (including acupuncture, chiropractic and homeopathy): "...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the orthodox health-care professions, and the skills of which are not part of the undergraduate curriculum of orthodox medical and paramedical health-care courses." By 2000 some medical schools in the UK were offering CAM familiarisation courses to undergraduate medical students while some were also offering modules specifically on CAM.

In 1991, pointing to a need for testing because of the widespread use of alternative medicine without authoritative information on its efficacy, United States Senator <a href="Tom%20Harkin">Tom Harkin</a> used $2 million of his discretionary funds to create the <a href="Office%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Unconventional%20Medical%20Practices">Office for the Study of Unconventional Medical Practices</a> (OSUMP), later renamed to be the <a href="Office%20of%20Alternative%20Medicine">Office of Alternative Medicine</a> (OAM). The OAM was created to be within the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Health">National Institute of Health</a> (NIH), the scientifically prestigious primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The mandate was to investigate, evaluate, and validate effective alternative medicine treatments, and alert the public as the results of testing its efficacy.

Sen. Harkin had become convinced his allergies were cured by taking <a href="bee%20pollen">bee pollen</a> pills, and was urged to make the spending by two of his influential constituents. Bedell, a longtime friend of Sen. Harkin, was a former member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> who believed that alternative medicine had twice cured him of diseases after mainstream medicine had failed, claiming that cow's milk <a href="colostrum">colostrum</a> cured his <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a>, and an herbal derivative from <a href="camphor">camphor</a> had prevented post surgical recurrence of his <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>. Wiewel was a promoter of unproven cancer treatments involving a mixture of blood sera that the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> had banned from being imported. Both Bedell and Wiewel became members of the advisory panel for the OAM. The company that sold the bee pollen was later fined by the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> for making false health claims about their bee-pollen products reversing the aging process, curing allergies, and helping with weight loss.

In 1994, Sen. Harkin (D) and Senator <a href="Orrin%20Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> (R) introduced the <a href="Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act">Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act</a> (<a href="DSHEA">DSHEA</a>). The act reduced authority of the FDA to monitor products sold as "natural" treatments. Labeling standards were reduced to allow health claims for supplements based only on unconfirmed preliminary studies that were not subjected to scientific peer review, and the act made it more difficult for the FDA to promptly seize products or demand proof of safety where there was evidence of a product being dangerous. The Act became known as "<a href="The%201993%20Snake%20Oil%20Protection%20Act">The 1993 Snake Oil Protection Act</a>" following a <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> editorial under that name.

Senator Harkin complained about the "unbendable rules of <a href="randomized%20clinical%20trials">randomized clinical trials</a>", citing his use of bee pollen to treat his allergies, which he claimed to be effective even though it was biologically implausible and efficacy was not established using scientific methods. Sen. Harkin asserted that claims for alternative medicine efficacy be allowed not only without conventional scientific testing, even when they are biologically implausible, "It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies." Following passage of the act, sales rose from about $4 billion in 1994, to $20 billion by the end of 2000, at the same time as evidence of their lack of efficacy or harmful effects grew. Senator Harkin came into open public conflict with the first OAM Director <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Jacobs">Joseph M. Jacobs</a> and OAM board members from the scientific and biomedical community. Jacobs' insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with Senator Harkin. Increasing political resistance to the use of scientific methodology was publicly criticized by Dr. Jacobs and another OAM board member complained that "nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office...It's the only place where opinions are counted as equal to data." In 1994, Senator Harkin appeared on television with cancer patients who blamed Dr. Jacobs for blocking their access to untested cancer treatment, leading Jacobs to resign in frustration.

In 1995, <a href="Wayne%20Jonas">Wayne Jonas</a>, a promoter of <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a> and political ally of Senator Harkin, became the director of the OAM, and continued in that role until 1999. In 1997, the NCCAM budget was increased from $12 million to $20 million annually. From 1990 to 1997, use of alternative medicine in the US increased by 25%, with a corresponding 50% increase in expenditures. The OAM drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community with letters to the Senate Appropriations Committee when discussion of renewal of funding OAM came up. Nobel laureate <a href="Paul%20Berg">Paul Berg</a> wrote that prestigious NIH should not be degraded to act as a cover for quackery, calling the OAM "an embarrassment to serious scientists." The president of the <a href="American%20Physical%20Society">American Physical Society</a> wrote complaining that the government was spending money on testing products and practices that "violate basic laws of physics and more clearly resemble witchcraft". In 1998, the President of the North Carolina Medical Association publicly called for shutting down the OAM.

In 1998, NIH director and Nobel laureate <a href="Harold%20Varmus">Harold Varmus</a> came into conflict with Senator Harkin by pushing to have more NIH control of alternative medicine research. The NIH Director placed the OAM under more strict scientific NIH control. Senator Harkin responded by elevating OAM into an independent NIH "center", just short of being its own "institute", and renamed to be the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Alternative%20Medicine">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a> (NCCAM). NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and "integration". In 1999, the NCCAM budget was increased from $20 million to $50 million. The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent. In 2000, the budget was increased to about $68 million, in 2001 to $90 million, in 2002 to $104 million, and in 2003, to $113 million.

In 2009, after a history of 17 years of government testing and spending of nearly $2.5 billion on research had produced almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies, Senator Harkin complained, "One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving." Members of the scientific community criticized this comment as showing Senator Harkin did not understand the basics of scientific inquiry, which tests hypotheses, but never intentionally attempts to "validate approaches". Members of the scientific and biomedical communities complained that after a history of 17 years of being tested, at a cost of over $2.5 Billion on testing scientifically and biologically implausible practices, almost no alternative therapy showed clear efficacy. In 2009, the NCCAM's budget was increased to about $122 million. Overall NIH funding for CAM research increased to $300 Million by 2009. By 2009, Americans were spending $34 Billion annually on CAM.

In 2012, the <a href="Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> (JAMA) published a criticism that study after study had been funded by NCCAM, but "failed to prove that complementary or alternative therapies are anything more than placebos". The JAMA criticism pointed to large wasting of research money on testing scientifically implausible treatments, citing "NCCAM officials spending $374,000 to find that inhaling lemon and lavender scents does not promote wound healing; $750,000 to find that prayer does not cure AIDS or hasten recovery from breast-reconstruction surgery; $390,000 to find that ancient Indian remedies do not control type 2 diabetes; $700,000 to find that magnets do not treat arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or migraine headaches; and $406,000 to find that coffee enemas do not cure pancreatic cancer." It was pointed out that negative results from testing were generally ignored by the public, that people continue to "believe what they want to believe, arguing that it does not matter what the data show: They know what works for them". Continued increasing use of CAM products was also blamed on the lack of FDA ability to regulate alternative products, where negative studies do not result in FDA warnings or FDA-mandated changes on labeling, whereby few consumers are aware that many claims of many supplements were found not to have not to be supported.

In 2014 the NCCAM was renamed to the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Integrative%20Health">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a> (NCCIH) with a new charter requiring that 12 of the 18 council members shall be selected with a preference to selecting leading representatives of complementary and alternative medicine, 9 of the members must be licensed practitioners of alternative medicine, six members must be general public leaders in the fields of public policy, law, health policy, economics, and management, and 3 members must represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine.

There is a general scientific consensus that Alternative Therapies lack the requisite <a href="scientific%20validation">scientific validation</a>, and their <a href="efficacy">effectiveness</a> is either <a href="Scientific%20method">unproved</a> or <a href="Scientific%20evidence">disproved</a>. Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed. <a href="Publication%20bias">Selective publication bias</a>, marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims, call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.

"The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine" points to confusions in the general population – a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the <a href="regression%20fallacy">regression fallacy</a>) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.

<a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on "sound evidence", although he believes that may be an overestimate. Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are "statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.

In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a> (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a>. According to a 2005 book by a US <a href="Institute%20of%20Medicine">Institute of Medicine</a> panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.

, the <a href="Cochrane%20Library">Cochrane Library</a> had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the <a href="Helsinki%20Declaration">Helsinki Declaration</a> states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.

Cancer researcher <a href="Andrew%20J.%20Vickers">Andrew J. Vickers</a> has stated:

Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many <a href="alternative%20cancer%20treatments">alternative cancer treatments</a> have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label "unproven" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been "disproven".

"CAM", meaning "complementary and alternative medicine", is not as well researched as conventional medicine, which undergoes intense research before release to the public. Funding for research is also sparse making it difficult to do further research for effectiveness of CAM. Most funding for CAM is funded by government agencies. Proposed research for CAM are rejected by most private funding agencies because the results of research are not reliable. The research for CAM has to meet certain standards from research ethics committees, which most CAM researchers find almost impossible to meet. Even with the little research done on it, CAM has not been proven to be effective.

<a href="Steven%20Novella">Steven Novella</a>, a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine, wrote that government funded studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream are "used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate." Marcia Angell considered that critics felt that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">scientific evidence</a>, and if a treatment had been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, science-based medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered "alternative" to begin with. It is possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. A prominent supporter of this position is <a href="George%20D.%20Lundberg">George D. Lundberg</a>, former editor of the <a href="Journal%20of%20the%20American%20Medical%20Association">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> (JAMA).

Writing in 1999 in "CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians" <a href="Barrie%20R.%20Cassileth">Barrie R. Cassileth</a> mentioned a 1997 letter to the <a href="US%20Senate">US Senate</a> Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, which had deplored the lack of critical thinking and scientific rigor in OAM-supported research, had been signed by four Nobel Laureates and other prominent scientists. (This was supported by the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH).)

In March 2009 a staff writer for "<a href="the%20Washington%20Post">the Washington Post</a>" reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Alternative%20Medicine">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>. They quoted one of these scientists, <a href="Steven%20Salzberg">Steven Salzberg</a>, a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying "One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience." They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of <a href="physiology">physiology</a> and <a href="disease">disease</a>, and had shown little or no effect.

Writers such as <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, a noted astrophysicist, advocate of <a href="scientific%20skepticism">scientific skepticism</a> and the author of "<a href="The%20Demon-Haunted%20World">The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</a>" (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.

Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated <a href="fallacy">contradiction</a> without thorough reason and experiment. Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results. Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some "alternatives" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.

Some critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably <a href="Wallace%20Sampson">Wallace Sampson</a> and <a href="Paul%20Kurtz">Paul Kurtz</a> founders of <a href="Scientific%20Review%20of%20Alternative%20Medicine">Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Barrett">Stephen Barrett</a>, co-founder of <a href="The%20National%20Council%20Against%20Health%20Fraud">The National Council Against Health Fraud</a> and webmaster of <a href="Quackwatch">Quackwatch</a>. Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:


Many alternative medical treatments are not <a href="patent">patent</a>able, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy – also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.

English evolutionary biologist <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>, in his 2003 book "<a href="A%20Devil%27s%20Chaplain">A Devil's Chaplain</a>", defined alternative medicine as a "set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests." Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.

CAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine. There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients. CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine, and it is often described as an issue of <a href="non-maleficence">non-maleficence</a>.

According to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K. Butler, marketing is part of the training required in alternative medicine, and propaganda methods in alternative medicine have been traced back to those used by <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a> and <a href="Goebels">Goebels</a> in their promotion of pseudoscience in medicine.

In November 2011 <a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> stated that the "level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this."

A research methods expert and author of "Snake Oil Science", <a href="R.%20Barker%20Bausell">R. Barker Bausell</a>, has stated that "it's become politically correct to investigate nonsense." There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded "legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate."

Use of placebos to achieve a <a href="placebo%20effect">placebo effect</a> in integrative medicine has been criticized as, "...diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology."

Another critic has argued that academic proponents of <a href="integrative%20medicine">integrative medicine</a> sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments to achieve a placebo effect. However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.

<a href="Integrative%20medicine">Integrative medicine</a> has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science-based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending <a href="placebo">placebo</a>s are not. "<a href="Quackery%23Criticism%20of%20quackery%20in%20academia">quackademic medicine</a>" is a pejorative term used for "<a href="integrative%20medicine">integrative medicine</a>", which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic <a href="science-based%20medicine">science-based medicine</a>.

An analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965–1999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals. Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Alternative%20Medicine">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>, currently <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Integrative%20Health">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</a>). In the "condemnation" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the "reassessment" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the "integration" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.

According to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.

About 50% of people in developed countries use some kind of complementary and alternative medicine other than prayer for health. A British telephone survey by the BBC of 1209 adults in 1998 shows that around 20% of adults in Britain had used alternative medicine in the past 12 months. About 40% of cancer patients use some form of CAM.

In <a href="developing%20country">developing nations</a>, access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and <a href="poverty">poverty</a>. <a href="Traditional%20medicine">Traditional remedies</a>, often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies, may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system. In Africa, traditional medicine is used for 80% of primary healthcare, and in developing nations as a whole over one-third of the population lack access to essential medicines.

Some have proposed adopting a <a href="prize">prize</a> system to reward medical research. However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the <a href="US%20National%20Center%20for%20Complementary%20and%20Alternative%20Medicine">US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>. NCCIH and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.

That alternative medicine has been on the rise "in countries where Western science and scientific method generally are accepted as the major foundations for healthcare, and 'evidence-based' practice is the dominant paradigm" was described as an "<a href="wikt%3Aenigma">enigma</a>" in the Medical Journal of Australia.

In the United States, the 1974 <a href="Child%20Abuse%20Prevention%20and%20Treatment%20Act">Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act</a> (CAPTA) required that for states to receive federal money, they had to grant religious exemptions to <a href="child%20neglect">child neglect</a> and <a href="child%20abuse">abuse</a> laws regarding religion-based healing practices. Thirty-one states have child-abuse religious exemptions.

The use of alternative medicine in the US has increased, with a 50 percent increase in expenditures and a 25 percent increase in the use of alternative therapies between 1990 and 1997 in America. Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually. Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain. In America, women were more likely than men to use CAM, with the biggest difference in use of <a href="Terms%20and%20concepts%20in%20alternative%20medicine%23Mind-body%20interventions">mind-body therapies</a> including prayer specifically for health reasons". In 2008, more than 37% of American hospitals offered alternative therapies, up from 27 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004. More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.

A survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that "there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize". Use of magnets was the most common tool in <a href="energy%20medicine">energy medicine</a> in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least "sort of <a href="scientific%20method">scientific</a>", when it is not at all scientific. In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies. "Therapeutic touch", was taught at more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 countries before the practice was debunked by a nine-year-old child for a school science project.

The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), <a href="herbalism">herbalism</a> (19%), <a href="Terms%20and%20concepts%20in%20alternative%20medicine%23Breathing%20Meditation">breathing meditation</a> (12%), <a href="meditation%20%28alternative%20medicine%29">meditation</a> (8%), <a href="chiropractic%20medicine">chiropractic medicine</a> (8%), <a href="yoga%20%28alternative%20medicine%29">yoga</a> (5–6%), <a href="body%20work%20%28alternative%20medicine%29">body work</a> (5%), <a href="Terms%20and%20concepts%20in%20alternative%20medicine%23Diet-based%20therapy">diet-based therapy</a> (4%), <a href="Terms%20and%20concepts%20in%20alternative%20medicine%23Progressive%20Relaxation">progressive relaxation</a> (3%), <a href="Orthomolecular%20medicine">mega-vitamin therapy</a> (3%) and <a href="Visualization%20%28cam%29">Visualization</a> (2%)

In Britain, the most often used alternative therapies were <a href="Alexander%20technique">Alexander technique</a>, <a href="Aromatherapy">Aromatherapy</a>, Bach and other flower remedies, Body work therapies including massage, Counseling stress therapies, <a href="hypnotherapy">hypnotherapy</a>, <a href="Meditation">Meditation</a>, <a href="Reflexology">Reflexology</a>, <a href="Shiatsu">Shiatsu</a>, <a href="Ayurvedic%20medicine">Ayurvedic medicine</a>, Nutritional medicine, and <a href="Yoga">Yoga</a>. Ayurvedic medicine remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials. Safety concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities.

According to the <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">National Health Service (England)</a>, the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.

Complementary therapies are often used in <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a> or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. "From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable." The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ <a href="mind-body%20intervention">mind-body</a> interventions designed to "reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life."

In Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with <a href="Medical%20degree">MDs</a>, and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs. In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.

Some professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as <a href="chiropractic">chiropractic</a>, have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.

Government bodies in the USA and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud. This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud, such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.

Some commentators have said that special consideration must be given to the issue of <a href="Conflict%20of%20interest">conflicts of interest</a> in alternative medicine. <a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> has said that most researchers into alternative medicine are at risk of "unidirectional bias" because of a generally uncritical belief in their chosen subject. Ernst cites as evidence the phenomenon whereby 100% of a sample of acupuncture trials originating in China had positive conclusions. <a href="David%20Gorski">David Gorski</a> contrasts <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>, in which researchers try to disprove hyphotheses, with what he says is the frequent practice in pseudoscience-based research, of striving to confirm pre-existing notions. <a href="Harriet%20A.%20Hall">Harriet A. Hall</a> writes that there is a contrast between the circumstances of alternative medicine practitioners and disinterested scientists: in the case of acupuncture, for example, an acupuncturist would have "a great deal to lose" if acupuncture were rejected by research; but the disinterested skeptic would not lose anything if its effects were confirmed; rather their change of mind would enhance their skeptical credentials.

Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.

A commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the way it's regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws. There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.

Advocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect. Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems. An anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking "natural" potions to "build up her strength" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.

To "ABC Online", MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired <a href="Adverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29">side-effects</a>, whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the "<a href="appeal%20to%20nature">appeal to nature</a>" fallacy, i.e., "That which is natural cannot be harmful." Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is <a href="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. Since 1938, the <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in "several significantly different ways from other drugs." Homeopathic preparations, termed "remedies", are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but "their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength", and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness. For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, "unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments" and refers to this as "<a href="opportunity%20cost">opportunity cost</a>". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes. Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.

There have always been "many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in <a href="biomedicine">biomedicine</a>. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as 'unproven,' suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown." However, "many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective...The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'."

<a href="Edzard%20Ernst">Edzard Ernst</a> has stated:

...any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Why? Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative "alternative cancer cures" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.

<doc id="1847" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847" title="Archimedean solid">
Archimedean solid

In <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, an Archimedean solid is one of the 13 solids first enumerated by Archimedes. They are the semi-regular <a href="convex%20polyhedron">convex polyhedron</a>s composed of <a href="regular%20polygon">regular polygon</a>s meeting in identical <a href="vertex%20%28geometry%29">vertices</a>, excluding the 5 <a href="Platonic%20solid">Platonic solid</a>s (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. They differ from the <a href="Johnson%20solid">Johnson solid</a>s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.

"Identical vertices" means that for any two vertices, there is a global <a href="isometry">isometry</a> of the entire solid that takes one vertex to the other. pointed out a widespread error in the literature on Archimedean solids: some authors only require that the faces that meet at one vertex be related by a local isometry to the faces that meet at any other vertex, and incorrectly claim that there are 13 solids satisfying this definition. There are 14, because the <a href="elongated%20square%20gyrobicupola">elongated square gyrobicupola</a> (pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron) is the unique convex polyhedron that has regular polygons meeting in the same way at each vertex, but that does not have a global symmetry taking any vertex to any other vertex. Because of this, Grünbaum suggested that the elongated square gyrobicupola should be counted as an Archimedean solid, which would give 14 Archimedean solids, but most authors (including Archimedes himself) do not include it in their lists of 13 Archimedean solids.

<a href="Prism%20%28geometry%29">Prisms</a> and <a href="antiprism">antiprism</a>s, whose <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a>s are the <a href="dihedral%20group">dihedral group</a>s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices. Excluding these two infinite families, there are 13 Archimedean solids. All the Archimedean solids (but not the elongated square gyrobicupola) can be made via <a href="Wythoff%20construction">Wythoff construction</a>s from the Platonic solids with <a href="Tetrahedral%20symmetry">tetrahedral</a>, <a href="Octahedral%20symmetry">octahedral</a> and <a href="icosahedral%20symmetry">icosahedral symmetry</a>.

The Archimedean solids take their name from <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>, who discussed them in a now-lost work. <a href="Pappus%20of%20Alexandria">Pappus</a> refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra. During the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, <a href="artist">artist</a>s and <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>s valued "pure forms" with high symmetry, and by around 1620 <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra, as well as defining the <a href="prism%20%28geometry%29">prisms</a>, <a href="antiprisms">antiprisms</a>, and the non-convex solids known as <a href="Kepler-Poinsot%20polyhedra">Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra</a>.

Kepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least, he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However, his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra, and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905, by <a href="Duncan%20Sommerville">Duncan Sommerville</a>.

There are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the <a href="elongated%20square%20gyrobicupola">elongated square gyrobicupola</a>; 15 if the <a href="mirror%20image">mirror image</a>s of two <a href="chirality%20%28mathematics%29">enantiomorphs</a>, see below, are counted separately).

Here the "vertex configuration" refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a <a href="vertex%20configuration">vertex configuration</a> of (4,6,8) means that a <a href="square">square</a>, <a href="hexagon">hexagon</a>, and <a href="octagon">octagon</a> meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).

Some definitions of <a href="semiregular%20polyhedron">semiregular polyhedron</a> include one more figure, the <a href="elongated%20square%20gyrobicupola">elongated square gyrobicupola</a> or "pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron".

The number of vertices is 720° divided by the vertex <a href="Defect%20%28geometry%29">angle defect</a>.

The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are <a href="edge-uniform">edge-uniform</a> and are called <a href="quasiregular%20polyhedron">quasi-regular</a>.

The <a href="dual%20polyhedron">duals</a> of the Archimedean solids are called the <a href="Catalan%20solid">Catalan solid</a>s. Together with the <a href="bipyramid">bipyramid</a>s and <a href="trapezohedron">trapezohedra</a>, these are the <a href="face-uniform">face-uniform</a> solids with regular vertices.

The snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as "<a href="chirality%20%28mathematics%29">chiral</a>", as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form. When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional <a href="mirror%20image">mirror image</a>, these forms may be called enantiomorphs. (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>s).

The different Archimedean and Platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions. Starting with a Platonic solid, <a href="truncation%20%28geometry%29">truncation</a> involves cutting away of corners. To preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners. Depending on how much is truncated (see table below), different Platonic and Archimedean (and other) solids can be created. <a href="expansion%20%28geometry%29">Expansion</a> or <a href="cantellation">cantellation</a> involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull. Expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces, thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles. The last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges. Ignoring scaling, expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation.

Note the duality between the cube and the octahedron, and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. Also, partially because the tetrahedron is self-dual, only one Archimedean solid has only tetrahedral symmetry.

<doc id="1851" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851" title="Antiprism">
Antiprism

In <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, an "n"-sided antiprism is a <a href="polyhedron">polyhedron</a> composed of two parallel copies of some particular "n"-sided <a href="polygon">polygon</a>, connected by an alternating band of <a href="triangle">triangle</a>s. Antiprisms are a subclass of the <a href="prismatoid">prismatoid</a>s and are a (degenerate) type of <a href="snub%20polyhedra">snub polyhedra</a>. 

Antiprisms are similar to <a href="prism%20%28geometry%29">prism</a>s except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.

In the case of a regular "n"-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle . Extra regularity is obtained when the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes, making it a right antiprism. As faces, it has the two <a href="n-gon">"n"-gonal</a> bases and, connecting those bases, 2"n" isosceles triangles.

A <a href="Prismatic%20uniform%20polyhedron">uniform</a> antiprism has, apart from the base faces, 2"n" equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For we have as degenerate case the regular <a href="tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a> as a "digonal antiprism", and for the non-degenerate regular <a href="octahedron">octahedron</a> as a "triangular antiprism".

The <a href="dual%20polyhedra">dual polyhedra</a> of the antiprisms are the <a href="trapezohedra">trapezohedra</a>. Their existence was discussed and their name was coined by <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, though it is possible that they were previously known to Archimedes as they satisfy the same conditions on vertices as the <a href="Archimedean%20solid">Archimedean solid</a>s.

<a href="Cartesian%20coordinates">Cartesian coordinates</a> for the vertices of a right antiprism with "n"-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are

with "k" ranging from 0 to 2"n" − 1; if the triangles are equilateral,

Let "a" be the edge-length of a <a href="uniform%20polyhedron">uniform</a> antiprism. Then the volume is

and the surface area is

There are an infinite set of <a href="Truncation%20%28geometry%29">truncated</a> antiprisms, including a lower-symmetry form of the <a href="truncated%20octahedron">truncated octahedron</a> (truncated triangular antiprism). These can be <a href="Alternation%20%28geometry%29">alternated</a> to create <a href="snub%20antiprism">snub antiprism</a>s, two of which are <a href="Johnson%20solid">Johnson solid</a>s, and the "snub triangular antiprism" is a lower symmetry form of the <a href="Regular%20icosahedron">icosahedron</a>.

The <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a> of a right "n"-sided antiprism with regular base and isosceles side faces is D of order 4"n", except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger symmetry group T of order 24, which has three versions of D as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger symmetry group O of order 48, which has four versions of D as subgroups.

The symmetry group contains <a href="inversion%20in%20a%20point">inversion</a> <a href="if%20and%20only%20if">if and only if</a> "n" is odd.

The <a href="rotation%20group%20SO%283%29">rotation group</a> is D of order 2"n", except in the case of a tetrahedron, which has the larger rotation group T of order 12, which has three versions of D as subgroups, and the octahedron, which has the larger rotation group O of order 24, which has four versions of D as subgroups.

Uniform star antiprisms are named by their <a href="star%20polygon">star polygon</a> bases, {"p"/"q"}, and exist in prograde and retrograde (crossed) solutions. Crossed forms have intersecting <a href="vertex%20figure">vertex figure</a>s, and are denoted by inverted fractions, "p"/("p" - "q") instead of "p"/"q", e.g. 5/3 instead of 5/2.

In the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry.

Some retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths, so are not uniform polyhedra. Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where "p" and "q" have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.

Natural history of Africa

The natural history of Africa encompasses some of the well known <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> of that <a href="continent">continent</a>.

<a href="Natural%20history">Natural history</a> is the study and description of organisms and natural objects, especially their origins, evolution, and interrelationships.

The vegetation of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture. The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally, which is tropical. In the countries bordering the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, there are groves of <a href="orange%20%28fruit%29">orange</a> and <a href="olive">olive</a> trees, evergreen <a href="oak">oak</a>s, <a href="cork%20oak">cork</a> trees and <a href="pine">pine</a>s, intermixed with <a href="cupressus">cypresses</a>, <a href="Myrtus">myrtles</a>, <a href="arbutus">arbutus</a> and fragrant <a href="Erica">tree-heaths</a>.

South of the <a href="Atlas%20mountains">Atlas</a> Range the conditions alter. The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness. Characteristic of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> is the <a href="date%20palm">date palm</a>, which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the <a href="acacia">acacia</a>, from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.

The more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper <a href="Nile">Nile</a>; and <a href="savanna">savanna</a> interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions the typical tree is the <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>, which flourishes wherever the soil is of a <a href="swamp">swamp</a> character.

The dense <a href="forest">forest</a>s of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s, two <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a>, "<a href="Elaeis%20guineensis">Elaeis guineensis</a>" (oil palm) and "<a href="Raphia%20vinifera">Raphia vinifera</a>" (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. "<a href="Bombax">Bombax</a>" or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as odum ("Chlorophora excelsa"), <a href="ebony">ebony</a>, <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> ("Khaya senegalensis"), <a href="Oldfieldia">Oldfieldia</a> ("Oldfieldia africana") and <a href="camwood">camwood</a> ("Baphia nitida"). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or "bush" is extremely dense.

In the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or baobab ("<a href="Adansonia%20digitata">Adansonia digitata</a>"), <a href="Hyphaene%20thebaica">doum palm</a> ("Hyphaene") and <a href="euphorbia">euphorbia</a>s. The <a href="coffee">coffee</a> plant grows wild in such widely separated places as <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> and southern <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a>, the <a href="Himalaya">Himalaya</a> and <a href="Indo-China">Indo-China</a>.

In the swamp regions of north-east Africa <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> and associated plants, including the soft-wooded <a href="ambach">ambach</a>, flourish in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of <a href="kapsia">kapsia</a>s, <a href="mesembryanthemum">mesembryanthemum</a>s, <a href="aloe">aloe</a>s and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the <a href="Podocarpus">Yellow-wood</a> ("Podocarpus elongatus"), <a href="stinkwood">stinkwood</a> ("Ocotea"), <a href="sneezewood">sneezewood</a> or <a href="Cape%20ebony">Cape ebony</a> ("Pteroxylon utile") and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.

The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation. The open savannas are the home of large <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s, especially <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s, the <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a> (peculiar to Africa), <a href="zebra">zebra</a>, <a href="Cape%20buffalo">buffalo</a>, wild <a href="donkey">donkey</a> and four species of <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>; and of carnivores, such as the <a href="lion">lion</a>, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>, <a href="hyena">hyena</a>, etc. The <a href="okapi">okapi</a> (a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo</a> basin. <a href="Bear">Bear</a>s are confined to the Atlas region, <a href="wolf">wolves</a> and <a href="fox">fox</a>es to North Africa. The <a href="elephant">elephant</a> (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the <a href="chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> and <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>. <a href="Baboon">Baboon</a>s and <a href="mandrill">mandrill</a>s, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped <a href="camel">camel</a>, as a domestic animal, is
especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.

The rivers in the tropical zone abound with <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotami</a> and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. <a href="Game%20reserve">Game reserve</a>s have, however, been established in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="British%20Central%20Africa">British Central Africa</a>, <a href="British%20East%20Africa">British East Africa</a>, <a href="Somaliland">Somaliland</a>, etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900.

The <a href="ornithology">ornithology</a> of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a> and the <a href="secretary-bird">secretary-bird</a>. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the <a href="desert">desert</a> and <a href="steppe">steppe</a> regions. The secretary-bird is common in the south. The <a href="weaver%20bird">weaver bird</a>s and their allies, including the <a href="long-tailed%20whydah">long-tailed whydah</a>s, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the <a href="francolin">francolin</a> and <a href="guineafowl">guineafowl</a>. Many of the smaller birds, such as the <a href="sunbird">sunbird</a>s, <a href="bee-eater">bee-eater</a>s, the <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s and <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s, as well as the larger <a href="plantain-eater">plantain-eater</a>s, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.

Of <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s the <a href="lizard">lizard</a> and <a href="chameleon">chameleon</a> are common, and there are a number of venomous <a href="snake">snake</a>s, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.

The <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a> is abundant. Of <a href="insect">insect</a>s Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the <a href="locust">locust</a> is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the <a href="termite">termite</a>s are almost incredible. The spread of <a href="malaria">malaria</a> by means of <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es is common. The <a href="tsetse%20fly">tsetse fly</a>, whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. It is found nowhere outside Africa.

Geography of Africa

<a href="Africa">Africa</a> is a <a href="continent">continent</a> comprising 63 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface. Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of , including adjacent islands. Its highest mountain is <a href="Mount%20Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, its largest lake is <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a> and its longest river is the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>.

Separated from <a href="Europe">Europe</a> by the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and from much of <a href="Asia">Asia</a> by the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (which is transected by the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>), wide. For <a href="geopolitics">geopolitical</a> purposes, the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, <a href="Ras%20ben%20Sakka">Ras ben Sakka</a> in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, at 37°21′ N, to the most southerly point, <a href="Cape%20Agulhas">Cape Agulhas</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, 34°51′15″ S, is a distance approximately of ; from <a href="Cap-Vert">Cap-Vert</a>, 17°31′13″W, the westernmost point, to <a href="Ras%20Hafun">Ras Hafun</a> in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, 51°27′52″ E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of .

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. <a href="Africa">Africa</a> is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, and the southern from north to south.

The average elevation of the continent approximates closely to above sea level, roughly near to the mean elevation of both <a href="North%20America">North</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, but considerably less than that of <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, . In contrast with other continents, it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground, lands under occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia or South America, but the area of land over is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges. Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term ["Inselberg-Landschaft", island mountain landscape] has been adopted in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> to describe this kind of country, thought to be in great part the result of wind action.)

As a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable. Apart from the lowlands and the <a href="Atlas%20mountains">Atlas mountain</a> range, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the north-west) running from the middle of the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> to about 6 deg. S. on the west coast.

Africa can be divided into a number of geographic zones:


The high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below , have a mean elevation of about . The <a href="South%20African%20Plateau">South African Plateau</a>, as far as about 12° S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the <a href="Great%20Karoo">Great Karoo</a>, is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a>.

The South African Plateau is connected towards <a href="East%20African%20plateau">East African plateau</a>, with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by <a href="Lake%20Nyasa">Lake Nyasa</a>), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.

Farther north the western hollow, known as the <a href="Albertine%20Rift">Albertine Rift</a> is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20%28Africa%29">Great Lakes</a> of <a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>, <a href="Lake%20Kivu">Kivu</a>, <a href="Lake%20Edward">Lake Edward</a> and <a href="Lake%20Albert%20%28Africa%29">Lake Albert</a>, the first-named over long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a <a href="meridional%20line">meridional line</a> east of the eastern trough. The eastern branch of the <a href="East%20African%20Rift">East African Rift</a>, contains much smaller lakes, many of them <a href="brackish%20water">brackish</a> and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being <a href="Lake%20Turkana">Lake Turkana</a> or Basso Norok.

At no great distance east of this rift-valley is <a href="Mount%20Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a> - with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being , and the culminating point of the whole continent — and <a href="Mount%20Kenya">Mount Kenya</a>, which is . Hardly less important is the <a href="Ruwenzori%20Range">Ruwenzori Range</a>, over , which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active. This could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash.

The third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the <a href="Ethiopian%20Highlands">Ethiopian Highlands</a>, a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below , while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m. This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by <a href="Lake%20Tsana">Lake Tsana</a>.

Both in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of . In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a> (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of , while Clarence Peak, in <a href="Fernando%20Po%20%28island%29">Fernando Po</a>, the first of the line of islands, rises to over . Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.

Much is Africa is made up of plains of the <a href="pediplain">pediplain</a> and <a href="etchplain">etchplain</a> type often occurring as steps. The etchplains aare commonly associated with <a href="laterite">laterite</a> soil and <a href="inselberg">inselberg</a>s.

The area between the east and west coast highlands, which north of 17° N is mainly desert, is divided into separate basins by other bands of high ground, one of which runs nearly centrally through North Africa in a line corresponding roughly with the curved axis of the continent as a whole. The best marked of the basins so formed (the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo</a> basin) occupies a circular area bisected by the equator, once probably the site of an inland sea.

Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>.

The arid region, the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara</a> — the largest hot desert in the world, covering  — extends from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> to the Red Sea. Though generally of slight elevation, it contains mountain ranges with peaks rising to Bordered N.W. by the Atlas range, to the northeast a rocky plateau separates it from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>; this plateau gives place at the extreme east to the delta of the Nile. That river (see below) pierces the desert without modifying its character. The <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas range</a>, the north-westerly part of the continent, between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places broad. From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara. The greater part of that now desert region is, indeed, furrowed by old water-channels.

The following table gives the details of the chief mountains and ranges of the continent:

From the outer margin of the African plateaus, a large number of streams run to the sea with comparatively short courses, while the larger rivers flow for long distances on the interior highlands, before breaking through the outer ranges. The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>.

To the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lakes are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganyika, lying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. There is also the considerably large Lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world -Malawi. There are also numerous water dams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in The republic of Ghana is called Akosombo on the Volta river (Fobil 2003).
The high lake plateau of the <a href="African%20Great%20Lakes">African Great Lakes</a> region contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo</a>.

The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighbourhood of the equator. From there, streams pour eastward into <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>, the largest lake in Africa (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into <a href="Lake%20Edward">Lake Edward</a> and <a href="Lake%20Albert%20%28Africa%29">Lake Albert</a>. To the latter of these, the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters. Issuing from there, the Nile flows northward, and between the latitudes of 7 and 10 degrees north it traverses a vast marshy level, where its course is liable to being blocked by floating vegetation. After receiving the Bahr-el-Ghazal from the west and the <a href="Sobat%20River">Sobat</a>, <a href="Blue%20Nile">Blue Nile</a> and <a href="Atbarah%20River">Atbara</a> from the <a href="Ethiopian%20Highlands">Ethiopian Highlands</a> (the chief gathering ground of the flood-water), it separates the great desert with its fertile watershed, and enters the Mediterranean at a vast delta.

The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the <a href="Chambezi%20River">Chambezi</a>, which flows southwest into the marshy <a href="Lake%20Bangweulu">Lake Bangweulu</a>. From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names. Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through <a href="Lake%20Mweru">Lake Mweru</a> and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa. Traversing this in a majestic northward curve, and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands.

North of the Congo basin, and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface, is the basin of <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a> – a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the <a href="Chari%20River">Chari</a> coming from the southeast.

West of this is the basin of the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger</a>, the third major river of Africa. With its principal source in the far west, it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo, and ultimately flows into the Atlantic — a fact that eluded European geographers for many centuries. An important branch, however — the <a href="Benue%20River">Benue</a>—flows from the southeast.

These four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa — the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea.

Of the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin, the <a href="Orange%20River">Orange</a>, in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the <a href="Drakensberg">Drakensberg</a> on the opposite side of the continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb; the <a href="Volta%20River">Volta</a>, Komoe, Bandama, <a href="Gambia%20River">Gambia</a> and <a href="Senegal%20River">Senegal</a> the highlands of the western limb. North of the Senegal, for over of coast, the arid region reaches to the Atlantic. Farther north are the streams, with comparatively short courses, reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains.

Of the rivers flowing to the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a>, whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11°21′3″ S 24°22′ E, at an elevation of . It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of <a href="Lake%20Nyasa">Lake Nyasa</a>, flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10° to 12° S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the <a href="Taukhe%20River">Taukhe</a> (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the <a href="Okavango%20River">Okavango</a>, is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in <a href="Lake%20Ngami">Lake Ngami</a>, now dried up.

Farther south, the <a href="Limpopo%20River">Limpopo</a> drains a portion of the interior plateau, but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source. The <a href="Rovuma%20River">Rovuma</a>, <a href="Rufiji%20River">Rufiji</a> and <a href="Tana%20River%20%28Kenya%29">Tana</a> principally drain the outer slopes of the African Great Lakes highlands.

In the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn</a> region to the north, the <a href="Jubba%20River">Jubba</a> and the <a href="Shebelle%20River">Shebelle</a> rivers begin in the <a href="Ethiopian%20Highlands">Ethiopian Highlands</a>. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba emptying in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The Shebelle River reaches a point to the southwest. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the Jubba River. Another large stream, the <a href="Hawash%20river">Hawash</a>, rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.

Between the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the Ethiopian plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the <a href="Great%20Rift%20Valley">Great Rift Valley</a>. The largest river is the <a href="Omo%20river">Omo</a>, which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into <a href="Lake%20Rudolf">Lake Rudolf</a>. The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths, or by cataracts at no great distance upstream. But when these obstacles have been overcome, the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters.

The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, where the corresponding area is 

The principal lakes of Africa are situated in the African Great Lakes plateau. As a rule, the lakes found within the Great Rift Valley have steep sides and are very deep. This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter with depths of .

Others, however, are shallow, and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season. Such are <a href="Lake%20Rukwa">Lake Rukwa</a>, in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the Great Rift Valley. Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a> being under .

Besides the African Great Lakes, the principal lakes on the continent are: <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a>, in the northern inland watershed; <a href="Lake%20Bangweulu">Bangweulu</a> and <a href="Lake%20Mweru">Mweru</a>, traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and <a href="Lake%20Mai-Ndombe">Lake Mai-Ndombe</a> and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river. All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Lake Chad appears to be drying up.

Divergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the African Great Lakes, especially <a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>, which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence. The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type. They include jellyfish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.

With the exception of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, the African islands are small. Madagascar, with an area of , is, after <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, the fourth largest island on the Earth. It lies in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, off the S.E. coast of the continent, from which it is separated by the deep <a href="Mozambique%20channel">Mozambique channel</a>, wide at its narrowest point. Madagascar in its general structure, as in flora and fauna, forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia. East of Madagascar are the small islands of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>. There are also islands in the Gulf of Guinea on which lies the Republic of Sao Tomé and Príncipe (islands of São Tomé and Príncipe). Part of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is lying on the island of Bioko (with the capital Malabo and the town of Lubu) and the island of Annobón. <a href="Socotra">Socotra</a> lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui. Off the north-west coast are the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary</a> and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> archipelagoes. which, like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea, are of volcanic origin. The <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Islands">South Atlantic Islands</a> of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> and <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension</a> are classed as Africa but are situated on the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a> half way to <a href="South%20America">South America</a>.

Lying almost entirely within the tropics, and equally to north and south of the equator, Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature.

Great heat is experienced in the lower plains and desert regions of North Africa, removed by the great width of the continent from the influence of the ocean, and here, too, the contrast between day and night, and between summer and winter, is greatest. (The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)

Farther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.

In the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.

The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.

The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of <a href="Mount%20Cameroon">Mount Cameroon</a>, where there is a mean annual rainfall of about as compared with a mean of at <a href="Cherrapunji">Cherrapunji</a>, in <a href="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a>, <a href="India">India</a>.

The two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.

The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> as the <a href="khamsin">khamsin</a>, on the Mediterranean as the <a href="sirocco">sirocco</a>, it is called on the Guinea coast the <a href="harmattan">harmattan</a>. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the <a href="Kalahari%20Desert">Kalahari Desert</a> in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.

The <a href="climate%20of%20Africa">climate of Africa</a> lends itself to certain environmental diseases, the most serious of which are: <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a> and <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>. Malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in Africa. It is transmitted by a genus of mosquito (<a href="anopheles%20mosquito">anopheles mosquito</a>) native to Africa, and can be contracted over and over again. There is not yet a vaccine for malaria, which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa. Recently, the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria.

Yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa. Unlike malaria, it cannot be contracted more than once. Like chicken pox, it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease.

Sleeping sickness, or African trypanosomiasis, is a disease that usually affects animals, but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well. It is transmitted by the <a href="Tsetse%20fly">Tsetse fly</a> and is found almost exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa. This disease has had a significant impact on African development not because of its deadly nature, like Malaria, but because it has prevented Africans from pursuing agriculture (as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock).

These are the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the continent.



The highest point in Africa is <a href="Mount%20Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, in <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. The lowest point is <a href="Lake%20Asal%20%28Djibouti%29">Lake Asal</a>, below sea level, in <a href="Djibouti">Djibouti</a>.

Approval voting

Approval voting is a single-winner <a href="electoral%20system">electoral system</a>. Each voter may "approve" of (i.e., select) any number of candidates. The winner is the most-approved candidate.

Guy Ottewell first described the system in 1977. Later <a href="Robert%20J.%20Weber">Robert J. Weber</a> coined the term "Approval Voting". It was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist <a href="Steven%20Brams">Steven Brams</a> and mathematician <a href="Peter%20Fishburn">Peter Fishburn</a>.

Approval voting can be considered a form of <a href="range%20voting">range voting</a>, with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1—or a form of <a href="majority%20judgment">majority judgment</a>, with grades restricted to "good" and "poor". Approval Voting can also be compared to <a href="plurality%20voting%20system">plurality voting</a>, without the rule that discards ballots that vote for more than one candidate.

By treating each candidate as a separate question, "Do you approve of this person for the job?" approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support.

Approval voting ballots show, for each office being contested, a list of the candidates running for that seat. Next to each name is a checkbox, or another similar way to mark "Yes" or "No" for that candidate. This "check yes or no" approach means approval voting provides one of the simplest ballots for a voter to understand.

Ballots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot can, therefore, be viewed as a small "<a href="Delta%20method">delta</a>" that separates two groups of candidates: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified.

Approval voting has been adopted by the <a href="Mathematical%20Association%20of%20America">Mathematical Association of America</a> (1986), the <a href="American%20Mathematical%20Society">American Mathematical Society</a>, the Institute of Management Sciences (1987) (now the <a href="Institute%20for%20Operations%20Research%20and%20the%20Management%20Sciences">Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences</a>), the <a href="American%20Statistical%20Association">American Statistical Association</a> (1987), and the <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (1987). The IEEE board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval voting. IEEE Executive Director Daniel J. Senese stated that approval voting was abandoned because "few of our members were using it and it was felt that it was no longer needed." Because none of these associations report results to their members and the public, it is difficult to evaluate Senese's claim and whether it is also true of other associations; Steven Brams' analysis of the 5-candidate 1987 Mathematical Association of America presidential election shows that 79% of voters cast a ballot for one candidate, 16% for 2 candidates, 5% for 3, and 1% for 4, with the winner earning the approval of 1,267 (32%) of 3,924 voters.

Approval voting was used for Dartmouth Alumni Association elections for seats on the College Board of Trustees, but after some controversy it was replaced with traditional runoff elections by an alumni vote of 82% to 18% in 2009. Dartmouth students started to use approval voting to elect their student body president in 2011. In the first election, the winner secured the support of 41% of voters against several write-in candidates. In 2012, Suril Kantaria won with the support of 32% of the voters. In 2013, 2014 and 2016, the winners also earned the support of under 40% of the voters. Results reported in The Dartmouth show that in the 2014 and 2016 elections, more than 80 percent of voters approved of only one candidate. Students replaced approval voting with plurality before the 2017 elections. 

Approval is used in internal elections by the <a href="Green%20party">Green Parties</a> of <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20Ohio">Ohio</a>, the <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20of%20Texas">Libertarian Party of Texas</a>, and the US <a href="Modern%20Whig%20Party">Modern Whig</a> party.

Historically, several voting methods that incorporate aspects of approval voting have been used:
The idea of approval was adopted by X. Hu and <a href="Lloyd%20Shapley">Lloyd Shapley</a> in 2003 in studying <a href="authority%20distribution">authority distribution</a> in organizations.

Approval voting also can be used in social scenarios as a fairer, but still quick system compared to an <a href="First-Past-The-Post">First-Past-The-Post</a> equivalent, being able to avoid a spoiler effect while being very quick to calculate

Consider this situation:

"Ten friends have to choose between three places for lunch: Kombucha Kick ("K"), Meatlover's Mansion ("M") and Super Sushi ("S"), and they are deciding via a vote. If they vote for their favourite place, and each person gets only one vote, the results could end up with:" 4 votes for Kombucha, 3 for Meatlover's and 3 for Sushi. "This would result in the group going to Kombucha, even though 6 of the 10 people did not vote for Kombucha (especially if some people despise Kombucha)." 

An approval voting system would work by asking the group on which places they are ok with, allowing them multiple votes and simply tallying up which place has the most votes, appropriate for a social situation, as figuring out preferences and proportion can take too long for simple decisions such as lunch.

Approval voting advocates Steven Brams and <a href="Dudley%20R.%20Herschbach">Dudley R. Herschbach</a> predict that approval voting should increase voter participation, prevent minor-party candidates from being spoilers, and reduce negative campaigning. The effect of this system as an <a href="electoral%20reform">electoral reform</a> measure is not without critics, however. <a href="FairVote">FairVote</a> has a position paper arguing that approval voting has three flaws that undercut it as a method of voting and political vehicle. They argue that it can result in the defeat of a candidate <a href="Majority%20criterion">who would win an absolute majority in a plurality election</a>, can allow a candidate to win who might not win "any" support in a plurality election, and has incentives for <a href="tactical%20voting">tactical voting</a>. The first two "flaws" are considered advantages by advocates of approval voting, as it chooses centrist candidates with broad appeal rather than polarizing candidates who appeal only to the majority.

One study showed that approval voting would not have chosen the same two winners as plurality voting (<a href="Jacques%20Chirac">Chirac</a> and <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Le Pen</a>) in <a href="French%20presidential%20election%2C%202002">France's presidential election of 2002</a> (first round) – it instead would have chosen Chirac and Jospin as the top two to proceed to a runoff. Le Pen lost by a very high margin in the runoff, 82.2% to 17.8%, a sign that the true top two had not been found. Straight approval voting without a runoff, from the study, still would have selected Chirac, but with an approval percentage of only 36.7%, compared to Jospin at 32.9%. Le Pen, in that study, would have received 25.1%. In the real primary election, the top three were Chirac, 19.9%, Le Pen, 16.9%, and Jospin, 16.2%. A study of various "evaluative voting" methods (approval voting and score voting) during <a href="French%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">the French presidential election, 2012</a> showed that "unifying" candidates tended to do better, and polarizing candidates did worse, via the evaluative voting methods than via the plurality system.

A generalized version of the <a href="Burr%20dilemma">Burr dilemma</a> applies to approval voting when two candidates are appealing to the same subset of voters. Although approval voting differs from the voting system used in the Burr dilemma, approval voting can still leave candidates and voters with the generalized dilemma of whether to compete or cooperate.

While in the modern era there have been relatively few competitive approval voting elections where tactical voting is more likely, Brams argues that approval voting usually elects <a href="Condorcet%20criterion">Condorcet winners</a> in practice. Critics of the use of approval voting in the alumni elections for the Dartmouth Board of Trustees in 2009 placed its ultimately successful repeal before alumni voters, arguing that the system has not been electing the most centrist candidates. "The Dartmouth" editorialized that "When the alumni electorate fails to take advantage of the approval voting process, the three required Alumni Council candidates tend to split the majority vote, giving petition candidates an advantage. By reducing the number of Alumni Council candidates, and instituting a more traditional one-person, one-vote system, trustee elections will become more democratic and will more accurately reflect the desires of our alumni base."

Approval voting is vulnerable to <a href="Tactical%20voting%23Bullet%20voting">Bullet Voting</a> and <a href="Tactical%20voting%23Compromising">Compromising</a>, while it is immune to <a href="Tactical%20voting%23Push-over">Push-Over</a> and <a href="Tactical%20voting%23Burying">Burying</a>.

<a href="Tactical%20voting%23Bullet%20voting">Bullet Voting</a> occurs when a voter approves "only" candidate 'a' instead of "both" 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose.

<a href="Tactical%20voting%23Compromising">Compromising</a> occurs when a voter approves an "additional" candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.

Strategic Approval voting differs from ranked choice voting methods where voters might "reverse" the preference order of two options. Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the "same" rating, despite having a strict preference order between them.

Approval voting experts describe sincere votes as those "... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'" They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's <a href="preference">ordinal preferences</a> as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate. This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently. When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from. Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates. When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.

Based on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:

If the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:

The decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary "approval cutoff." All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.

A sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. <a href="tactical%20voting">Voting strategy</a> is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it. This differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter.

When there are three or more candidates, the winner of an approval voting election can change, depending on which sincere votes are used. In some cases, approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates, including a <a href="Condorcet%20winner">Condorcet winner</a> and a <a href="Condorcet%20loser">Condorcet loser</a>, without the voter preferences changing. To the extent that electing a Condorcet winner and not electing a Condorcet loser is considered desirable outcomes for a voting system, approval voting can be considered vulnerable to sincere, strategic voting. In one sense, conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases. On the other hand, the variety of possible outcomes has also been portrayed as a virtue of approval voting, representing the flexibility and responsiveness of approval voting, not just to voter ordinal preferences, but cardinal utilities as well.

Approval voting avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous preferences. For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is <a href="strategy-proof">strategy-proof</a> (also known as strategy-free). When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists. However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical. It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.

Having dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates. All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group. A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates—prefers A to B and B to C—does not have dichotomous preferences.

Being strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.

Another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold. An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of. A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate. Acceptance thresholds are similar. With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.

With threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist. However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting. Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the <a href="Condorcet%20criterion">Condorcet criterion</a> and other social choice criteria.

Voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval voting. On the one hand, approval voting fails the <a href="later-no-harm%20criterion">later-no-harm criterion</a>, so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more preferred candidate. On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the <a href="monotonicity%20criterion">monotonicity criterion</a>, so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate. Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner. A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the <a href="von%20Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern%20utility%20theorem">von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem</a>, and the probabilities of how others vote.

A <a href="Tactical%20voting%23Myerson-Weber%20strategy">rational voter model</a> described by <a href="Roger%20Myerson">Myerson</a> and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating. This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter's <a href="Utility%23Expected%20utility">expected utility</a>, subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.

An optimal approval vote always votes for the most preferred candidate and not for the least preferred candidate. However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.

Other strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations. For example:

Another strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.

Optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a <a href="Condorcet%20loser%20criterion">Condorcet loser</a>. Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances. For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.

In the example election described <a href="Condorcet%20method%23An%20example">here</a>, assume that the voters in each faction share the following von Neumann–Morgenstern utilities, fitted to the interval between 0 and 100. The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.

Using these utilities, voters choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties. In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.

In the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely. As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility. Most voters vote for only their first choice. Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga. As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.

In the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties. As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.

In the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place. This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.

Only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up. As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>, this is an "equilibrium." In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.

As this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others. While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.

For example, - in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):

C wins with 65% of the voters' approval, beating B with 60%, D with 40% and A with 35%

If voters' threshold for receiving a vote is that the candidate has an above average approval, or they vote for their two most approved of candidates, this is not a dichotomous cutoff, as this can change if candidates drop out. On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:
B now wins with 60%, beating C with 55% and D with 40%

With dichotomous cutoff, C still wins.
B now wins with 70%, beating C and A with 65%

With dichotomous cutoff, C still wins.

Most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences. In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria.

There is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are criteria that many voting theorists accept and consider desirable:


Approval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections. A simple way to do so is as "block approval voting," a simple variant on <a href="Plurality-at-large%20voting">block voting</a> where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win. This does not provide <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> and is subject to the <a href="Burr%20dilemma">Burr dilemma</a>, among other problems.

Other ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised. Among these are <a href="satisfaction%20approval%20voting">satisfaction approval voting</a> and <a href="proportional%20approval%20voting">proportional approval voting</a> for determining a proportional assembly, and minimax approval for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most.

Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand-write the names of the candidates they support. A more structured ballot lists all candidates, and voters mark each candidate they support. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)
All four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an "undervote" when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The "single bubble" format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting).

Unless the second or fourth format is used, fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot (that is, it does not make it appear inconsistent). Thus, approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the "chain of custody" of ballots is secure.

Arizona State University

Arizona State University (commonly referred to as ASU or Arizona State) is a <a href="public%20university">public</a> <a href="Urban%20university">metropolitan</a> <a href="research%20university">research university</a> on five campuses across the <a href="Phoenix%20Metropolitan%20Area">Phoenix metropolitan area</a>, and four regional learning centers throughout Arizona. The 2018 university ratings by "U.S. News & World Report" rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the third year in a row and has ranked ASU No. 115 in National Universities with overall score of 47/100 with 83% of student applications accepted.

ASU is one of the <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20university%20campuses%20by%20enrollment">largest public universities</a> by enrollment in the U.S. It had approximately 72,000 students enrolled in fall 2016, including nearly 59,000 undergraduate and more than 13,000 graduate students. ASU's charter, approved by the <a href="Higher%20education%20governing%20board">board of regents</a> in 2014, is based on the "New American University" model created by ASU President <a href="Michael%20M.%20Crow">Crow</a>. It defines ASU as "a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it excludes, but rather by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves."

ASU is classified as a research university with "R1: Doctoral Universities – Highest Research Activity" designation by the <a href="Carnegie%20Classification%20of%20Institutions%20of%20Higher%20Education">Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>. Since 2005, ASU has been ranked among the top research universities in the U.S., public and private, based on research output, innovation, development, research expenditures, number of awarded patents and awarded research grant proposals. <a href="The%20Center%20for%20Measuring%20University%20Performance">The Center for Measuring University Performance</a> ranked ASU 24th among top U.S. public research universities in its 2015 report. ASU was classified as a <a href="Research%20I">Research I</a> institute in 1994, making it one of the nation's newest major research universities (public or private).

Students currently compete in 24 varsity sports; Sun Devil Athletics fields teams in ten men's and 14 women's sports. Women's lacrosse has been added and will begin play in spring 2018, while men's tennis will return to ASU in 2017–18. The <a href="Arizona%20State%20Sun%20Devils">Arizona State Sun Devils</a> are members of the <a href="Pac-12%20Conference">Pac-12 Conference</a> and have won 24 <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> championships. Along with multiple athletic clubs and recreational facilities, ASU is home to more than 1,100 <a href="Student%20society">registered student organizations</a>, reflecting the student body's diversity. To keep pace with the student population's growth, the university continuously renovates and expands infrastructure. The demand for new academic halls, athletic facilities, student recreation centers, and <a href="Dormitory">residential halls</a> is being addressed with donor contributions and public-private investments.

Arizona State University was established as the Territorial Normal School at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the <a href="13th%20Arizona%20Territorial%20Legislature">13th Arizona Territorial Legislature</a> passed an act to create a <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a> to train teachers for the <a href="Arizona%20Territory">Arizona Territory</a>. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as Tempe Normal School of Arizona (1889–1903), Tempe Normal School (1903–1925), Tempe State Teachers College (1925–1929), Arizona State Teachers College (1929–1945), Arizona State College (1945–1958) and, by a state vote, Arizona State University in 1958. The school accepted high school students and graduates, and awarded high school diplomas and teaching certificates to those who completed the requirements.

In 1923 the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925 the school became the Tempe State Teachers College and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the Arizona State Teachers College. Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900–1930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision, the first being in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an "evergreen campus," with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of <a href="Palm%20Walk">Palm Walk</a>, now a landmark of the Tempe campus. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having been declared a nationally recognized arboretum.

During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Ralph W. Swetman was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to the college from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. Swetman a three-year term, during which time he focused on the development of improved teacher-training programs. During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time.

In 1933, <a href="Grady%20Gammage">Grady Gammage</a>, then-president of <a href="Northern%20Arizona%20University">Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff</a>, became president of then–Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like President Matthews before him, Gammage oversaw construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university's graduate programs. The school's name was changed to Arizona State College in 1945, and finally to Arizona State University in 1958. At the time, two other names considered were Tempe University and State University at Tempe. Among Gammage's greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed construction of what is today Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage, the university's hallmark building, which was completed in 1964, five years after the president's death. Gammage was succeeded by Harold D. Richardson, who served as acting president for nine months before the appointment of the university's 11th president, <a href="G.%20Homer%20Durham">G. Homer Durham</a>.

By the 1960s, with the presidency of Durham, the university began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award Doctor of Philosophy and other doctoral degrees. By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.

The next three presidents — Harry K. Newburn (1969–71), John W. Schwada (1971–81) and J. Russell Nelson (1981–89), including and Interim President Richard Peck (1989), led the university to increased academic stature, the establishment of the <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20West%20campus">ASU West campus</a> in 1984 and its subsequent construction in 1986, a focus on computer-assisted learning and research, and rising enrollment.

Under the leadership of <a href="Lattie%20F.%20Coor">Lattie F. Coor</a>, president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20at%20the%20Polytechnic%20campus">Polytechnic campus</a> and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in <a href="undergraduate%20education">undergraduate education</a>, research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of <a href="Barrett%2C%20The%20Honors%20College">Barrett, The Honors College</a>, and the <a href="Herberger%20Institute%20for%20Design%20and%20the%20Arts">Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts</a>; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.
In 2002, <a href="Michael%20M.%20Crow">Michael M. Crow</a> became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a "New American University"—one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Universities">Association of American Universities</a> criteria and to become a member. Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into "One university in many places"—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20at%20the%20West%20campus">West</a> and <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20at%20the%20Polytechnic%20campus">Polytechnic</a> campuses. ASU's <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20at%20the%20Downtown%20Phoenix%20campus">Downtown Phoenix campus</a> was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the <a href="Colleges%40ASU">ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City</a> and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.

During Crow’s tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the establishment of the <a href="Biodesign%20Institute">Biodesign Institute</a> at Arizona State University, the <a href="ASU%20School%20of%20Sustainability">Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability</a>, and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of four <a href="Nobel%20Laureates">Nobel Laureates</a>. Since 2002 the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5 million square feet of space has been added to the university's research facilities.

The <a href="Great%20Recession">economic downturn</a> that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed down about four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators; however, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses, and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in <a href="Lake%20Havasu%20City">Lake Havasu City</a>.

In 2015, the existing <a href="Thunderbird%20School%20of%20Global%20Management">Thunderbird School of Global Management</a> became the fifth ASU campus, as the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.

The Beus Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU’s <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor%20College%20of%20Law">Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law</a>, opened in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.

The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the state's other public universities; <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a> and <a href="Northern%20Arizona%20University">Northern Arizona University</a>. The Board of Regents is composed of twelve members including eleven voting, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regent members with eight year terms that are appointed by the Governor, and two Student Regents with two years term, serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices. <a href="Arizona%20Board%20of%20Regents">ABOR</a> provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has five campuses in metropolitan <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a> including the Tempe campus in <a href="Tempe%2C%20Arizona">Tempe</a>; the West campus and the Thunderbird School of Global Management in <a href="Glendale%2C%20Arizona">Glendale</a>; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in <a href="Mesa%2C%20Arizona">Mesa</a>. ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at <a href="Lake%20Havasu%20City%2C%20Arizona">Lake Havasu City</a> in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the institution's chief executive officer and the chief budget officer. The president executes measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the university's property, and acts as the university's official representative to the Board of Regents. The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers. The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th ASU president is <a href="Michael%20M.%20Crow">Michael M. Crow</a>, who has served since July 1, 2002.

ASU's academic programs are spread across campuses in the <a href="Phoenix%20Metropolitan%20Area">Phoenix Metropolitan Area</a>; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as "one university in many places," inferring there is "not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses." The university considers each campus "distinctive" and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs designed to prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment. The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation. The Polytechnic campus is the location of many of the university's simulators and laboratories dedicated for project-based learning. The West campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts, while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society. The Downtown campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing, public policy, criminal justice, mass communication, and journalism. ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School campus. Inter-campus shuttles and <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU's "virtual campus", housed at the university's <a href="Skysong%2C%20the%20ASU%20Scottsdale%20Innovation%20Center">SkySong Innovation Center</a>, provides <a href="online%20education">online</a> and extended education.

ASU's Tempe campus is in downtown <a href="Tempe%2C%20Arizona">Tempe, Arizona</a>, about east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately in size. The campus is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum. The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU's campuses, with 76,844 students enrolled in at least one class on campus in fall 2016. The campus is considered to range from the streets Rural Road to Mill Avenue and Apache Boulevard to Rio Salado Parkway.

The Tempe campus is ASU's original campus, and <a href="Old%20Main%20%28Arizona%20State%20University%29">Old Main</a>, the first building constructed, still stands today. Old Main was known as the Normal School when it was first constructed, and was originally a teachers college. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including <a href="Grady%20Gammage%20Memorial%20Auditorium">Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium</a>, designed by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees, Charles Trumbull Hayden Library, the University Club building, Margaret Gisolo Dance Theatre, and University Bridge. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection, considered one of the ten best among university public art collections in America according to "Public Art Review". Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of <a href="Tempe%2C%20Arizona">downtown Tempe</a>) which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. Students also have Tempe Marketplace, which is a shopping, dining, and entertainment center with an outdoor setting and is about 1.8 miles away from campus. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university's athletic facilities.

The West campus was established in 1984 by the Arizona Legislature and sits on in a suburban area of northwest Phoenix. The West campus lies about northwest of downtown Phoenix, and about northwest of the Tempe campus. The West campus is designated as a <a href="Phoenix%20Points%20of%20Pride">Phoenix Point of Pride</a>, and is nearly completely powered by a 4.7<a href="megawatt">MW</a> <a href="solar%20array">solar array</a>. This campus serves 19,382 students and offers more than 70 degree programs from the <a href="New%20College%20of%20Interdisciplinary%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">New College of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a href="Mary%20Lou%20Fulton%20Teachers%20College">Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College</a>, <a href="W.P.%20Carey%20School%20of%20Business">W.

In the summer of 2013, the campus added the Sun Devil Fitness Center in conjunction with the original YMCA building. ASU's <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor%20College%20of%20Law">Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law</a> relocated from Tempe to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2016.

In response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona, ASU developed the small, undergraduate-only college in Lake Havasu City. ASU Colleges are teaching-focused and provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors. The Lake Havasu City campus offers high-demand undergraduate degrees with lower tuition rates than other Arizona research universities and a 15-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio.

ASU Online offers more than 100 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through an entirely <a href="online%20education">online</a> platform. The degree programs delivered online hold the same accreditation as the university's traditional face-to-face programs. ASU Online is headquartered at ASU's <a href="Skysong%2C%20the%20ASU%20Scottsdale%20Innovation%20Center">SkySong</a> campus in <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale</a>, Arizona. ASU Online was ranked in the Top 4 for Best Online Bachelor's Programs by <a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>.

Online students are taught by the same faculty and receive the same diploma as on-campus students. ASU online programs are designed to allow students to learn in highly interactive environments through student collaboration and through technological personalized learning environments.

In April 2015, ASU Online announced a partnership with <a href="edX">edX</a> to form a one of a kind program called the Global Freshman Academy. The program is open to all potential students. The students do not need to send in a high school transcript or GPA to apply for the courses. Students only pay for the courses ($600 per credit) after they have passed the course if they want to earn the credits.

As of spring 2017, more than 25,000 students were enrolled through ASU Online. In June 2014, ASU Online and <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> announced a partnership called the Starbucks College Achievement Plan. The Starbucks College Achievement Plan offers all benefits-eligible employees full-tuition coverage when they enroll in any one of ASU Online's more than 60 undergraduate degree programs.

In 2016, <a href="Mayo%20Clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> and ASU formed a new platform for health care education and research: the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University Alliance for Health Care. Through this alliance, Mayo Clinic and ASU have created a blended curriculum in the Science of Health Care Delivery. Beginning in 2017, Mayo Clinic School of Medicine students in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale</a> are among the first to earn a certificate in the Science of Health Care Delivery, with the option to earn a master's degree in the Science of Health Care Delivery through ASU. This program joins five additional dual degree programs and previous initiatives between Mayo Clinic and ASU, including undergraduate programs through ASU's <a href="Barrett%2C%20The%20Honors%20College">Barrett, The Honors College</a> and a nationally recognized partnership between Mayo Clinic and ASU's College of Nursing and Health Innovation.

Thunderbird School of Global Management is one of the newest units of "Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise." The flagship campus is in Glendale, Arizona, at Thunderbird Field No. 1, a former military airfield from which it derives its name.

Admission to any of the public universities in Arizona is ensured to residents in the top 25% of their high school class with a <a href="GPA">GPA</a> of 3.0 in core competencies. For fall 2016, ASU admitted 81.0% of all freshman applicants, and is considered a "more selective" university by "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>". Average GPA of enrolling freshman was 3.49; the average <a href="SAT">SAT</a> score was 1136 for critical reading and math combined; and the average <a href="ACT%20%28test%29">ACT</a> composite score was 25.0. All freshmen are required to live on campus.

<a href="Barrett%2C%20The%20Honors%20College">Barrett, The Honors College</a> is ranked among the top honors programs in the nation. Although there are no set minimum admissions criteria for Barrett College, the average GPA of Fall 2016 incoming freshmen was 3.79, with average SAT scores of 1284/1600 and ACT scores of 28.8. The Honors college enrolls 6,894 undergraduate students, with 395 <a href="National%20Merit%20Scholars">National Merit Scholars</a>.

The international student body represents more than 150 nations and more than 60 student clubs and organizations exist at ASU to serve the growing number of students from abroad.<ref name="http://about.asu.edu/facts.html"></ref> The growth in the number of international students in 2016 at ASU is a 17% increase over the 2014 figure. The <a href="Institute%20of%20International%20Education">Institute of International Education</a> ranked ASU as the top public university in the U.S. for hosting international students in 2015–2016.

ASU offers over 250 majors to undergraduate students, and more than 100 graduate programs leading to numerous masters and <a href="doctorate">doctoral</a> degrees in the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts and sciences</a>, <a href="Herberger%20Institute%20for%20Design%20and%20the%20Arts">design and arts</a>, <a href="Ira%20A.%20Fulton%20School%20of%20Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="journalism">journalism</a>, <a href="Mary%20Lou%20Fulton%20Teachers%20College">education</a>, <a href="business%20school">business</a>, <a href="law%20school">law</a>, <a href="nursing">nursing</a>, <a href="public%20policy">public policy</a>, <a href="technology">technology</a>, and <a href="ASU%20School%20of%20Sustainability">sustainability</a>. These programs are divided into 16 colleges and schools which are spread across ASU's six campuses. ASU also offers the 4+1 accelerated program, which allows students in their senior year to attain their master's degree the following year. However the 4+1 accelerated program is not associated with all majors, for example in the Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College the 4+1 accelerated program only works with Education Exploratory majors. ASU uses a plus-minus grading system with highest cumulative GPA awarded of 4.0 (at time of graduation). Arizona State University is accredited by the <a href="North%20Central%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a>.

The 2017 "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" ratings of nearly 1,800 U.S. colleges and universities ranked ASU 61st among public universities, 115th of national universities, and 121st in the world's top 1,000 global universities. ASU was also ranked No. 1 among America’s 31 "Most Innovative Universities." The innovation ranking, new for 2016, was determined by a poll of top college officials nationwide asking them to name institutions "that are making the most innovative improvements in terms of curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology or facilities."

ASU is ranked 51st–61st in the U.S. and 101st–150th in the world among the top 500 universities in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities (<a href="ARWU">ARWU</a>), and 56th U.S./102nd world by the 2016 Center for World University Rankings. "<a href="Money%20Magazine">Money Magazine</a>" ranked ASU 162nd of 711 U.S. schools it evaluated for its 2017 Best Colleges ranking. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Beast">The Daily Beast</a>" ranked ASU 172nd of nearly 2,000 U.S. schools in its 2014 Best Colleges ranking. "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" ranks ASU 5th in the nation for producing the best-qualified graduates, determined by a nationwide poll of corporate recruiters, and "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine named ASU one of America's best college buys.

In 2012, Public University Honors wrote, "ASU students ranked fifth among all public universities in National Science Foundation grants for graduate study and 11th among all universities, including the schools of the Ivy League. Among other things, the high achievement in this area of excellence points to consistently strong advising and support, a logical outcome of Barrett (Arizona State University's honor college) investing more in honors staff than any other honors program [we reviewed]."

The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Research%20Laboratory">Army Research Laboratory</a> extended funding for the Arizona State University <a href="Flexible%20display">Flexible Display</a> Center (FDC) in 2009 with a $50 million grant. The university has partnered with <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7 million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world’s largest flexible full-color organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which at the time was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display. The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has been able to successfully integrate into the technology. In 2012, ASU successfully eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.

ASU's faculty and students are served by nine libraries across five campuses: Hayden Library, Noble Library, Music Library and Design and the Arts Library on the Tempe campus; Fletcher Library on the West campus; Downtown Phoenix campus library and Ross-Blakley Law Library at the Downtown Phoenix campus; Polytechnic campus library; and the Thunderbird Library at the Thunderbird campus.

As of 2013, ASU's libraries held 4.5 million volumes. The Arizona State University library system is ranked the 34th largest research library in the United States and Canada, according to criteria established by the <a href="Association%20of%20Research%20Libraries">Association of Research Libraries</a> that measures various aspects of quality and size of the collection. The University continues to grow its rare <a href="special%20collections">special collections</a>, such as the recent addition of a privately held collection of <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s by poet <a href="Rub%C3%A9n%20Dar%C3%ADo">Rubén Darío</a>.

Hayden Library is on Cady Mall in the center of the Tempe campus. It opened in 1966 and is the largest library facility at ASU. An expansion in 1989 created the subterranean entrance underneath Hayden Lawn and is attached to the above-ground portion of the original library. There are two floors underneath Hayden Lawn with a landmark known as the ""Beacon of Knowledge"" rising from the center. The underground library lights the beacon at night.

The 2013 <a href="Capital%20Improvement%20Plan">Capital Improvement Plan</a>, approved by the <a href="Arizona%20Board%20of%20Regents">Arizona Board of Regents</a>, incorporates a $35 million repurposing and renovation project for Hayden Library. The open air moat area that serves as an outdoor study space will be enclosed to increase indoor space for the library. Along with increasing space and renovating the facility, the front entrance of Hayden Library will be rebuilt.

As of March 2014, ASU was the top institution of higher education in the United States for solar generating capacity. Today, the university generates over 24 megawatts (MW) of electricity from on-campus solar arrays. This is an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW. ASU has 88 <a href="Photovoltaic%20system">solar photovoltaic</a> (PV) installations containing 81,424 solar panels across four campuses and the <a href="Arizona%20State%20University%20Research%20Park">ASU Research Park</a>. An additional 29 MWdc solar installation was dedicated at Red Rock, Arizona in January 2017, bringing the university's solar generating capacity to 50 MWdc.

Additionally, six <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s installed on the roof of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability building on the Tempe campus have operated since October 2008. Under normal conditions, the six turbines produce enough electricity to power approximately 36 computers.

ASU's <a href="ASU%20School%20of%20Sustainability">School of Sustainability</a> was the first school in the United States to introduce degrees in the field of <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a>. ASU's School of Sustainability is part of the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability. The School was established in spring 2007 and began enrolling undergraduates in fall 2008. The school offers majors, minors, and a number of certificates in sustainability. ASU is also home to the Sustainability Consortium which was founded by <a href="Jay%20Golden">Jay Golden</a> in 2009.

The School of Sustainability has been essential in establishing the university as "a leader in the academics of sustainable business." The university is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious and principled organizations for embedding sustainable practices into its <a href="operating%20model">operating model</a>. The university has embraced several challenging sustainability <a href="benchmarking">benchmarks</a>. Among the numerous benchmarks outlined in the university's <a href="Concept%20note">prospectus</a>, is the creation of a large <a href="recycling">recycling</a> and <a href="compost">compost</a>ing operation that by 2015, will eliminate 90% of the <a href="solid%20waste">solid waste</a> generated by all on-campus activities. This endeavor will be aided by educating students about the benefits of avoiding <a href="overconsumption">overconsumption</a> that contributes to excessive waste. Sustainability courses have been expanded to attain this goal and many of the university's individual colleges and schools have integrated such material into their <a href="lecture">lecture</a>s and courses. Second, ASU is on track to reduce its rate of water consumption by 50%. The university's most aggressive benchmark is to be the first, large research university to achieve <a href="carbon%20neutrality">carbon neutrality</a> as it pertains to its <a href="Enterprise%20carbon%20accounting">Scope 1, 2</a> and non-transportation Scope 3 <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> (GHG) emissions.

Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School. Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the "golden promise" of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the "Normals" were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days. Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery while white represents the balance of negativity and positivity. As it is in the city of Tempe, Arizona, the school's colors adorn the neighboring buildings during big game days and festive events.

<a href="Sparky%20the%20Sun%20Devil">Sparky the Sun Devil</a> is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8, 1946. Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> in which the university has participated. The university's mascot is not to be confused with the athletics department's logo, the "Pitchfork" or hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo is used on various sport facilities, uniforms and athletics documents. Arizona State Teacher’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School’s teams were simply known as the Normals. Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in <a href="Sun%20Devil%20Stadium">Sun Devil Stadium</a> or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the USA at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category. Currently, ASU's varsity intercollegiate <a href="cheerleading">cheerleading</a> team is not allowed to participate at athletic events (e.g. football and basketball games) due to dismissal regarding prior misconduct. ASU Cheerleading has since become a club sport, through the Student Recreation Center, competing locally and nationally as a Collegiate Co-Ed Division IA-Level VI team. They have reestablished their commitment to excellence, winning various championships. The team has a strict code of conduct and is seeking reinstatement from the university to participate at athletic events.

A letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A "T" followed by an "N" were the first letters to grace the landmark. <a href="Tempe%20Butte">Tempe Butte</a>, home to "A" Mountain, has had the "A" installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original "A" was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs and a new "A", constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955. The vandals were never identified but many speculate the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient <a href="Hohokam">Hohokam</a> <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding "A" Mountain, including a revived "guarding of the 'A'" in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools. "Whitewashing" of the "A" is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week and is repainted gold before the first football game of the season. Whitewashing dates back to the 1930s and it grows in popularity every year, with thousands of students going up to paint the "A" every year.

The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917. It is considered one of ASU’s "most cherished" traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up "A" Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of "good will between the classes" and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to "A" Mountain to "light up" Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before <a href="Homecoming">Homecoming</a>, a tradition that dates back to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.

Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team in 2012. The ROTC cadets associated with the university are responsible for the transportation of the bell to various events and for ringing the bell after games are won by the Sun Devils. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell in use was removed from Memorial Union for renovations. The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium, near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark.

<a href="Sun%20devil%20marching%20band">The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band</a>, created in 1915 and known as the "Pride of the Southwest", was the first of only two <a href="marching%20band">marching band</a>s in the Pac-12 to be awarded the prestigious <a href="Sudler%20trophy%23The%20Sudler%20Trophy">Sudler Trophy</a>. The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the Super Bowl XLII, in addition to many others. Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a> Todd Graham. It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The most recognizable songs played by the band are "Alma Mater" and ASU's <a href="fight%20songs">fight songs</a> titled "<a href="Maroon%20and%20gold">Maroon and Gold</a>" and the "Al Davis Fight Song". "Alma Mater" was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937. "Maroon and Gold" was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The "Al Davis Fight Song" (also known as "Go, Go Sun Devils" and "Arizona State University Fight Song") was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.

President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> gave a lecture at Wells Fargo Arena on May 5, 1998.

President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> became the first sitting president to visit ASU on October 31, 1996, speaking on the <a href="Grady%20Gammage%20Memorial%20Auditorium">Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium</a> lawn. He returned to ASU in 2006, and in 2014 President Clinton, <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, and <a href="Chelsea%20Clinton">Chelsea Clinton</a> came to campus to host the Clinton Global Initiative University. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> became the second sitting president to visit the school's campus when he debated Senator <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> at the university's <a href="Grady%20Gammage%20Memorial%20Auditorium">Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium</a> on October 13, 2004. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> visited ASU as sitting president on May 13, 2009. President Obama delivered the commencement speech for the Spring 2009 Commencement Ceremony, speaking to more than 60,000 people at Sun Devil Stadium. President Obama had previously visited the school as a United States Senator. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> did not visit ASU as president, but visited Phoenix as president on October 31, 1970 at an event that included a performance by the Arizona State University Band, which President Nixon acknowledged. As part of President Nixon's remarks, he stated that, "when I am in Arizona, Arizona State is number one."

On May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education%20Releases%20List%20of%20Higher%20Education%20Institutions%20with%20Open%20Title%20IX%20Sexual%20Violence%20Investigations">fifty five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights</a> "for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by Barack Obama's White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits. In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged they were harassed or assaulted asked the federal investigation be expanded.
In August 2014 ASU President Michael Crow appointed a task force comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university’s efforts to address sexual violence. Crow accepted the recommendations of the task force in November 2014.

In 2011, Professor Matthew Whitaker was accused of plagiarizing material in six books he had written, as well as in a speech he made to local high school students. After watching a video of the speech, a plagiarism analyst said he could pretty much read along from a newspaper article as Whitaker spoke. To the intense consternation of ASU faculty members (the chairman of the tenure committee resigned in protest) an investigating committee concluded there was no pattern of deceit and the copying had been inadvertent. It all popped up again in 2014 with another Whitaker book, “Peace Be Still: Modern Black America From World War II to Barack Obama.” A blogger writing under an apparent pseudonym set out side-by-side excerpts from Whitaker’s book and material available on the Web at sites like infoplease.com and the Archive of American Television. They are more than just similar in tone. Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department. Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide “cultural-consciousness training” to Phoenix police. The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far. He was placed on administrative leave on September 17, 2015, while the university investigated allegations that "his behavior has fallen short of expectations as a faculty member and a scholar."

Astoria, Oregon

Astoria is a <a href="port%20city">port city</a> and the seat of <a href="Clatsop%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clatsop County, Oregon</a>, United States. Situated near the mouth of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> where it meets the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, the city was named after <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor">John Jacob Astor</a>, an investor from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> whose <a href="American%20Fur%20Company">American Fur Company</a> founded <a href="Fort%20Astoria">Fort Astoria</a> at the site in 1811, . Astoria was incorporated by the <a href="Oregon%20Legislative%20Assembly">Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> on October 20, 1876.

It holds the distinction of being the first permanent United States settlement on the Pacific coast and for having the first U.S. post office west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

Located on the south shore of the Columbia River, the city is served by the deepwater Port of Astoria. Transportation includes the <a href="Astoria%20Regional%20Airport">Astoria Regional Airport</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030%20in%20Oregon">U.S. Route 30</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%20101%20in%20Oregon">U.S. Route 101</a> as the main highways, and the <a href="Astoria%E2%80%93Megler%20Bridge">Astoria–Megler Bridge</a> connecting to neighboring <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> across the river. The population was 9,477 at the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a>.

The <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> spent the winter of 1805–06 at <a href="Fort%20Clatsop">Fort Clatsop</a>, a small log structure south and west of modern-day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by to take them back east, but instead they endured a torturous winter of rain and cold, later returning the way they came. Today the fort has been recreated and is now a <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20National%20and%20State%20Historical%20Parks">historical park</a>.
In 1811, British explorer <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28explorer%29">David Thompson</a>, the first person known to have navigated the <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28explorer%29%23Columbia%20travels">entire length</a> of the Columbia River, reached the partially constructed <a href="Fort%20Astoria">Fort Astoria</a> near the mouth of the river. He arrived just two months after the <a href="Pacific%20Fur%20Company">Pacific Fur Company</a>'s ship, the "<a href="Tonquin%20%281807%29">Tonquin</a>". The fort constructed by the Tonquin party established Astoria as a U.S., rather than a British, settlement, became a vital post for American exploration of the continent and was later used as an American claim in the <a href="Oregon%20boundary%20dispute">Oregon boundary dispute</a> with European nations.

The Pacific Fur Company, a subsidiary of <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor">John Jacob Astor</a>'s <a href="American%20Fur%20Company">American Fur Company</a>, was created to begin fur trading in the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>. During the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, in 1813, the company's officers sold its assets to their Canadian rivals, the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a>. The fur trade would remain under British control until U.S. pioneers following the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a> began filtering into the town in the mid-1840s. The <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Treaty of 1818</a> established joint U.S. – British occupancy of the Oregon Country.
In 1846, the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> divided the mainland at the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel north</a>, and the southern portion of <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a> south of this line was awarded to the British.

<a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>, a prominent American writer with a European reputation, was approached by John Jacob Astor to mythologize the three-year reign of his Pacific Fur Company. "<a href="Astoria%20%28book%29">Astoria</a>" (1835), written while Irving was Astor's guest, cemented the importance of the region in the American psyche. In Irving's words, the fur traders were "Sinbads of the wilderness", and their venture was a staging point for the spread of American economic power into both the continental interior and into the Pacific.
As the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a> grew and became increasingly more colonized by Americans, Astoria likewise grew as a <a href="Port">port city</a> near the mouth of the great river that provided the easiest access to the interior. The first U.S. post office west of the Rocky Mountains was established in Astoria in 1847 and official state incorporation in 1876.

Astoria attracted a host of immigrants beginning in the late 19th century: <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic</a> settlers, primarily <a href="Finnish%20Americans">Finns</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese</a> soon became larger parts of the population. The Finns mostly lived in Uniontown, near the present-day end of the Astoria–Megler Bridge, and took fishing jobs; the Chinese tended to do <a href="Salmon%20cannery">cannery</a> work, and usually lived either downtown or in <a href="bunkhouse">bunkhouse</a>s near the canneries. By the late 1800s, 22% of Astoria's population was Chinese.

In 1883, and again in 1922, downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, partly because it was mostly wood and entirely raised off the marshy ground on pilings. Even after the first fire, the same format was used, and the second time around the flames spread quickly again, as collapsing streets took out the water system. Frantic citizens resorted to <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a>, blowing up entire buildings to stop the fire from going further.
Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin, although it has long since been eclipsed by <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and <a href="Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a>, as an economic hub on the coast of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. Astoria's economy centered on fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia; however, in 1974, the <a href="Bumble%20Bee%20%28brand%29">Bumblebee Seafood</a> corporation moved its headquarters out of Astoria and gradually reduced its presence until closing its last Astoria cannery in 1980. The <a href="lumber%20industry">lumber industry</a> likewise declined; Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closed in 1989, and the <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway</a> discontinued service to Astoria in 1996.

From 1921 to 1966, a <a href="Astoria%E2%80%93Megler%20Ferry">ferry route across the Columbia River</a> connected Astoria with <a href="Pacific%20County%2C%20Washington">Pacific County, Washington</a>. In 1966, the <a href="Astoria%E2%80%93Megler%20Bridge">Astoria–Megler Bridge</a> was opened. The bridge completed <a href="U.S.%20Route%20101">U.S. Route 101</a> and linked Astoria with Washington on the opposite shore of the Columbia, replacing the ferry service.

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. Logging and fishing persist, but at a fraction of their former levels. It is a port of call for <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a>s since 1982, after $10 million in pier improvements to accommodate these larger ships. To avoid <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> ports of call during the <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic">Swine Flu outbreak of 2009</a>, many cruises were re-routed to include Astoria. The residential community "<a href="The%20World%20%28cruise%20ship%29">The World</a>" visited Astoria in June 2009. The town's seasonal sport fishing tourism has been active for several decades

In addition to the replicated Fort Clatsop, another point of interest is the <a href="Astoria%20Column">Astoria Column</a>, a tower high, built atop Coxcomb Hill above the town, with an inner circular staircase allowing visitors to climb to see a panoramic view of the town, the surrounding lands, and the Columbia flowing into the Pacific. The tower was built in 1926 with financing by the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Great Northern Railway</a> and <a href="Vincent%20Astor">Vincent Astor</a> of the <a href="Astor%20family">Astor family</a>, the great-grandson of John Jacob Astor, in commemoration of the city's role in the family's business history and the region's early history.

Since 1998, artistically-inclined fishermen and women from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the Pacific Northwest have traveled to Astoria for the <a href="Fisher%20Poets%20Gathering">Fisher Poets Gathering</a>, where poets and singers tell their tales to honor the fishing industry and lifestyle.

Astoria is also the western terminus of the <a href="TransAmerica%20Bicycle%20Trail">TransAmerica Bicycle Trail</a>, a coast-to-coast bicycle touring route created in 1976 by the <a href="Adventure%20Cycling%20Association">Adventure Cycling Association</a>.

Three <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Cutter">cutters</a>: the "<a href="USCGC%20Steadfast%20%28WMEC-623%29">Steadfast</a>", "<a href="USCGC%20Alert%20%28WMEC-630%29">Alert</a>", and "<a href="USCGC%20Fir%20%28WLB-213%29">Fir</a>", call the port of Astoria home.

It was the first publication to focus solely on <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>s. The initial aim of the publication was to prevent the playing styles to become so divergent that people couldn't participate in games together. 

Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions.

Alfred Jarry

Alfred Jarry (; 8 September 1873 – 1 November 1907) was a French <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolist</a> writer who is best known for his play "<a href="Ubu%20Roi">Ubu Roi</a>" (1896). He also coined the term and philosophical concept of <a href="%27pataphysics">'pataphysics</a>.

Jarry was born in <a href="Laval%2C%20Mayenne">Laval, Mayenne</a>, France, and his mother was from <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>. He was associated with the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> movement. His play "<a href="Ubu%20Roi">Ubu Roi</a>" (1896) is often cited as a forerunner of <a href="Dada">Dada</a>, and to the <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> and <a href="Futurism">Futurist</a> movements of the 1920s and 1930. Jarry wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles, prefiguring the <a href="Post-modern%20literature">postmodern</a>. He wrote plays, novels, poetry, essays and speculative journalism. His texts are considered examples of <a href="absurdist%20literature">absurdist literature</a> and <a href="Post-modern%20philosophy">postmodern philosophy</a>.

At the lycée in <a href="Rennes">Rennes</a> when he was 15, he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well-meaning, but obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named Hébert. Jarry and his classmate, Henri Morin, wrote a play they called "Les Polonais" and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends. The main character, "Père Heb", was a blunderer with a huge belly, three teeth (one of stone, one of iron and one of wood), a single, retractable ear and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work "Ubu Roi", Père Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.

At 17 Jarry passed his <a href="baccalaur%C3%A9at">baccalauréat</a> and moved to Paris to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, "Les minutes de sable mémorial", was published in 1893.

That same year, both his parents died, leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent.

Jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called "my sacred herb" or, when referring to <a href="absinthe">absinthe</a>, the "green goddess." A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).

When he was drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame—the army did not issue uniforms small enough—was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired his novel "Days and Nights".

Jarry returned to Paris and applied himself to writing, drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with <a href="Remy%20de%20Gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</a> in the publication of "<a href="L%27Ymagier">L'Ymagier</a> ," a luxuriously produced "art" magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolism</a> as an art movement was in full swing at this time, and "L'Ymagier" provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's play "<a href="Caesar%20Antichrist">Caesar Antichrist</a>" (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Revelation">pageRank.Book of Revelation</a> as a point of departure, "Caesar Antichrist" presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which Christ is resurrected not as an agent of <a href="spirituality">spirituality</a> but as an agent of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> such as the 1894 excavation of the <a href="Narmer%20Palette">Narmer Palette</a>, an ancient artifact used for situating the <a href="rebus">rebus</a> within <a href="hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a>. The character Ubu Roi first appears in this play.

The spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review "Le Livre d'art", of Jarry's 5-act play "<a href="Ubu%20Roi">Ubu Roi</a>," the rewritten and expanded "Les Polonais" of his school days. "Ubu Roi"s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe took the risk, producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Œuvre.

On opening night (10 December 1896), with traditionalists and the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> in the audience, King Ubu (played by Firmin Gémier) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, "Merdre!" (often translated as "Pshit" or "Shittr!" in English). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until after Jarry's death.

The play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the <a href="royal%20we">royal "we"</a>, and called the wind "that which blows" and the bicycle he rode everywhere "that which rolls."

Jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition. The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, "If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you."

With <a href="Franc-Nohain">Franc-Nohain</a> and <a href="Claude%20Terrasse">Claude Terrasse</a> he co-founded the <a href="Th%C3%A9atre%20des%20Pantins">Théatre des Pantins</a>, which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of "Ubu Roi".

Living in worsening poverty, neglecting his health and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write the novel "Le Surmâle" ("<a href="Supermale%20%28novel%29">The Supermale</a>"), which is partly a satire on the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> ideal of self-transcendence.

Unpublished until after his death, his fiction "<a href="Exploits%20and%20Opinions%20of%20Dr.%20Faustroll%2C%20Pataphysician">Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician</a>" ("Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien") describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of "<a href="%27pataphysics">'pataphysics</a>". 'Pataphysics deals with "the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one." In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.

Jarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, "If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion."

In his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. <a href="Guillaume%20Apollinaire">Guillaume Apollinaire</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Salmon">André Salmon</a> and <a href="Max%20Jacob">Max Jacob</a> sought him out in his truncated apartment. <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> was fascinated with Jarry. After Jarry's death Picasso acquired his revolver and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris. He later bought many of his manuscripts as well as executing a fine drawing of him.

Jarry died in Paris on 1 November 1907 of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, aggravated by drug and alcohol use. When he could not afford alcohol, he drank ether. It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick. He was interred in the <a href="Cimeti%C3%A8re%20parisien%20de%20Bagneux">Cimetière de Bagneux</a>, near Paris.

Amalric

Amalric or Amalaric (also Americ, Almerich, Emeric, Emerick and other variations) is a personal name derived from the tribal name "Amal" (referring to the Gothic <a href="Amali">Amali</a>) and "ric" (<a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> "reiks") meaning "ruler, prince". 

Equivalents in different languages include:

Amalric of Jerusalem

Amalric (; ; 113611 July 1174) was <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem">King of Jerusalem</a> from 1163, and <a href="Count%20of%20Jaffa%20and%20Ascalon">Count of Jaffa and Ascalon</a> before his accession. He was the second son of <a href="Melisende%20of%20Jerusalem">Melisende</a> and <a href="Fulk%20of%20Jerusalem">Fulk of Jerusalem</a>, and succeeded his older brother <a href="Baldwin%20III%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin III</a>. During his reign, Jerusalem became more closely allied with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, and the two states launched an unsuccessful <a href="Crusader%20invasions%20of%20Egypt">invasion of Egypt</a>. Meanwhile, the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under <a href="Nur%20ad-Din%20Zangi">Nur ad-Din</a> and later <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>. He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem, <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla</a>, <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a>, and <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Isabella I</a>.

Older scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers, making Amalric to be Amalric I (1163–74) and King <a href="Aimery%20of%20Jerusalem">Aimery</a> (1197–1205) to be "Amalric II". Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king. Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.

Amalric was born in 1136 to King Fulk, the former <a href="count%20of%20Anjou">count of Anjou</a> who had married the heiress of the kingdom, Melisende, daughter of King <a href="Baldwin%20II%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin II</a>. After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143, the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalric's older brother <a href="Baldwin%20III%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin III</a>, who was still only 13 years old. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later, and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the <a href="County%20of%20Jaffa">County of Jaffa</a> as an <a href="apanage">apanage</a> when he reached the age of majority in 1151, remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the <a href="Tower%20of%20David">Tower of David</a> with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In 1153 Baldwin captured the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian fortress of <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>, which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see <a href="Battle%20of%20Ascalon%20%281153%29">Battle of Ascalon</a>).

Amalric married <a href="Agnes%20of%20Courtenay">Agnes of Courtenay</a> in 1157. Agnes, daughter of <a href="Joscelin%20II%20of%20Edessa">Joscelin II of Edessa</a>, had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader <a href="County%20of%20Edessa">County of Edessa</a> were lost in 1150. <a href="Patriarch%20Fulk%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch Fulcher</a> objected to the marriage on grounds of <a href="consanguinity">consanguinity</a>, as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, <a href="Guy%20I%20of%20Montlh%C3%A9ry">Guy I of Montlhéry</a>, and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric three children: <a href="Sibylla%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla</a>, the future <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a> (both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right), and Alix, who died in childhood.

Baldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the "<a href="Haute%20Cour%20of%20Jerusalem">Haute Cour</a>" refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled. The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Tyre">William of Tyre</a>, whom she prevented from becoming <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem</a> decades later, as well as from William's continuators like <a href="Ernoul">Ernoul</a>, who hints at a slight on her moral character: "car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem" ("there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem"). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married <a href="Hugh%20of%20Ibelin">Hugh of Ibelin</a>, to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.

During Baldwin III's reign, the County of Edessa, the first <a href="crusader%20state">crusader state</a> established during the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, was conquered by <a href="Zengi">Zengi</a>, the Turkic emir of <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. Zengi united Aleppo, <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>, and other cities of northern Syria, and intended to impose his control on <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> in the south. The <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a> in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus, which soon fell to Zengi's son <a href="Nur%20ad-Din%20Zangi">Nur ad-Din</a>. Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a>. Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt, where the <a href="Fatimid%20dynasty">Fatimid dynasty</a> was suffering from a series of young <a href="caliph">caliph</a>s and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of <a href="Baldwin%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin I</a>, who died during an expedition there. The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible.

Amalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163, claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III. The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier <a href="Shawar">Shawar</a>, and marched out to meet Amalric at <a href="Pelusium">Pelusium</a>, but was defeated and forced to retreat to <a href="Bilbeis">Bilbeis</a>. The Egyptians then opened up the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general <a href="Shirkuh">Shirkuh</a> to settle the dispute in 1164. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus.

Amalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken <a href="Bohemund%20III%20of%20Antioch">Bohemund III of Antioch</a> and <a href="Raymond%20III%20of%20Tripoli">Raymond III of Tripoli</a> prisoner at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Harim">Battle of Harim</a> during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in 1165 (Raymond remained in captivity until 1173). The year 1166 was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured <a href="Banias">Banias</a>.

In 1167, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph <a href="al-Adid">al-Adid</a> himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem. Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric. However, Amalric could not remain there indefinitely, and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute.

After his return to Jerusalem in 1167, Amalric married <a href="Maria%20Comnena%2C%20Queen%20consort%20of%20Jerusalem">Maria Comnena</a>, a great-grandniece of <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Manuel%20I%20Comnenus">Manuel I Comnenus</a>. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in <a href="Tyre%20%28Lebanon%29">Tyre</a> on August 29, 1167. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow <a href="Theodora%20Komnene%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Theodora</a>, eloped with her cousin <a href="Andronicus%20I%20Comnenus">Andronicus</a> to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, and <a href="Akko">Acre</a>, which had been in her possession, reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that <a href="William%20of%20Tyre">William of Tyre</a> was promoted to <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom.

In 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a> eagerly supported this invasion, while the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a> refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated.

In January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>. Amalric became alarmed and sent <a href="Frederick%20de%20la%20Roche">Frederick de la Roche</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Tyre">Archbishop of Tyre</a>, to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged <a href="Damietta">Damietta</a> by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.

Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of <a href="Eilat">Eilat</a>, severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again no help was received. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also by the <a href="Hashshashin">Hashshashin</a>; in one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Hashshashin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.

Nur ad-Din died in 1174, upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias. On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem. William of Tyre explains that "after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days, he ordered physicians of the Greek, Syrian, and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy." Neither they nor Latin doctors could help, and he died on July 11, 1174.

Maria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters: <a href="Isabella%20of%20Jerusalem">Isabella</a>, who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen, was born in 1172; and a stillborn child some time later. On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed <a href="Nablus">Nablus</a> to Maria and Isabella, both of whom would retire there. The <a href="leprosy">leprous</a> child <a href="Baldwin%20IV">Baldwin IV</a> succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay (now married to her fourth husband) back to court.

William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail. "He had a slight impediment in his speech, not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence. He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech." Like his brother Baldwin III, he was more of an academic than a warrior, who studied law and languages in his leisure time: "He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact, he was second to no one in this respect." He was probably responsible for <a href="assise%20sur%20la%20ligece">an assize</a> making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour. Amalric had an enormous curiosity, and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning, during an illness, the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection</a> of the body. He especially enjoyed reading and being read to, spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history. He did not enjoy games or spectacles, although he liked to hunt. He was trusting of his officials, perhaps too trusting, and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him, although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly.

He was tall and fairly handsome; "he had sparkling eyes of medium size; his nose, like that of his brother, was becomingly aquiline; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead. A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin. He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook." He did not overeat or drink to excess, but his corpulence grew in his later years, decreasing his interest in military operations; according to William, he "was excessively fat, with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist."
Amalric was pious and attended mass every day, although he also "is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women..." Despite his piety he taxed the clergy, which they naturally opposed.

As William says, "he was a man of wisdom and discretion, fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom." He is considered the last of the "early" <a href="kings%20of%20Jerusalem">kings of Jerusalem</a>, after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse. Within a few years, Emperor Manuel died as well, and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east.

Aimery of Cyprus

Aimery of Lusignan (; before 11551 April 1205), erroneously referred to as Amalric or Amaury in earlier scholarship, was the first <a href="King%20of%20Cyprus">King of Cyprus</a> from 1196 to 1205. He was also <a href="King%20of%20Jerusalem">King of Jerusalem</a> by virtue of being the husband of the queen, <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Isabella I</a>, from 1197 to 1205. He was the younger son of <a href="Hugh%20VIII%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh VIII of Lusignan</a>, a nobleman in <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>. After participating in a rebellion against <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> in 1168, he went to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> and settled in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>.

His marriage to <a href="Eschiva%20of%20Ibelin%20%28died%201196%29">Eschiva of Ibelin</a> (whose father, <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Ibelin">Baldwin of Ibelin</a> was an influential nobleman) strengthened his position in the kingdom. His younger brother, <a href="Guy%20of%20Lusignan">Guy</a>, married <a href="Sibylla%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla</a>, the sister of and heir to <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV of Jerusalem</a>. Baldwin made Aimery <a href="Constable%20of%20Jerusalem">Constable of Jerusalem</a> around 1180. He was one of the commanders of the Christian army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a>, which ended with decisive defeat at the hands of the army of <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the <a href="Ayyubid%20dynasty">Ayyubid</a> sultan of Egypt and Syria, on 4 July 1187.

Aimery supported his brother, Guy, even after Guy had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem according to most barons of the realm, because of the death of Sibylla and their two daughters. The new king of Jerusalem, <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Henry of Champagne</a>, arrested him for a short period. After his release, he retired to <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> which was the fief of his elder brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan, who had left the Holy Land.

After Guy died in May 1194, his vassals in Cyprus elected Aimery as their lord. He accepted the suzerainty of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry VI</a>. With the emperor's authorization, Aimery was crowned King of Cyprus in September 1197. He soon married Henry of Champagne's widow, Isabella I of Jerusalem. He and his wife were crowned king and queen of Jerusalem in January 1198. He signed a truce with <a href="Al-Adil%20I">Al-Adil I</a>, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, which secured the Christian possession of the coastline from <a href="Acre">Acre</a> to <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. His rule was a period of peace and stability in both of his realms.

Aimery was the fifth son of <a href="Hugh%20VIII%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh VIII of Lusignan</a> and his wife, <a href="Burgundia%20of%20Rancon">Burgundia of Rancon</a>. <a href="House%20of%20Lusignan">His family</a> had been noted for generations of crusaders in their native <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>. His great-grandfather, <a href="Hugh%20VI%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh VI of Lusignan</a>, died in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramla%20%281102%29">Battle of Ramla</a> in 1102; Aimery's grandfather, <a href="Hugh%20VII%20of%20Lusignan">Hugh VII of Lusignan</a>, took part in the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a>. Aimery's father also came to the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> and died in a Muslim prison in the 1160s. Earlier scholarship erroneously referred to him as Amalric (or Amaury, its French form), but documentary evidence shows he was actually called "Aimericus", which is a distinct name (although it was sometimes confused with "Amalricus" already in the Middle Ages). He was born before 1155.

Aimery joined a rebellion against <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> (who also ruled Poitou) in 1168, according to <a href="Robert%20of%20Torigni">Robert of Torigni</a>'s chronicle, but Henry crushed the rebellion. Aimery left for the Holy Land and settled in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. He was captured in a battle and held in captivity in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. A popular tradition (which was first recorded by the 13th-century <a href="Philip%20of%20Novara">Philip of Novara</a> and <a href="John%20of%20Ibelin%20%28jurist%29">John of Ibelin</a>) held, the <a href="king%20of%20Jerusalem">king of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Amalric%20of%20Jerusalem">Amalric</a>, ransomed him personally.

<a href="Ernoul">Ernoul</a> (whose reliability is questioned) claimed, Aimery was a lover of Amalric of Jerusalem's former wife, <a href="Agnes%20of%20Courtenay">Agnes of Courtenay</a>. Aimery married <a href="Eschiva%20of%20Ibelin%20%28died%201196%29">Eschiva of Ibelin</a>, a daughter of <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Ibelin">Baldwin of Ibelin</a>, who was one of the most powerful noblemen in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Amalric of Jerusalem, who died on 11 July 1174, was succeeded by his thirteen-year-old son by Agnes of Courtenay, <a href="Baldwin%20IV%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin IV</a> who suffered from <a href="Lepromatous%20leprosy">leprosy</a>. Aimery became the member of the royal court with his father-in-law's support.

Aimery's youngest brother, <a href="Guy%20of%20Lusignan">Guy</a>, married Baldwin IV's widowed sister, <a href="Sibylla%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Sibylla</a>, in April 1180. Ernoul wrote, it was Aimery who had spoken of his brother to her and her mother, Agnes of Courtenay, describing him as a handsome and charming young man. Aimery, continued Ernoul, hurried back to Poitou and persuaded Guy to come to the kingdom, although Sibylla had promised herself to Aimery's father-in-law. Another source, <a href="William%20of%20Tyre">William of Tyre</a>, did not mention that Aimery had played any role in the marriage of his brother and the king's sister. Consequently, many elements of Ernoul's report (especially Aimery's alleged journey to Poitou) were most probably invented.

Aimery was first mentioned as <a href="Constable%20of%20Jerusalem">Constable of Jerusalem</a> on 24 February 1182. According to <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a> and Malcolm Barber, he had already been granted the office shortly after his predecessor, <a href="Humphrey%20II%20of%20Toron">Humphrey II of Toron</a>, died in April 1179. Historian Bernard Hamilton writes, Aimery's appointment was the consequence of the growing influence of his brother and he was appointed only around 1181.

<a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>, the <a href="Ayyubid%20dynasty">Ayyubid</a> sultan of Egypt and Syria, launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Jerusalem on 29 September 1183. Aimery defeated the sultan's troops in a minor skirmish with the support of his father-in-law and his brother, <a href="Balian%20of%20Ibelin">Balian of Ibelin</a>. After the victory, the crusaders' main army could advance as far as a spring near Saladin's camp, forcing him to retreat nine days later. During the campaign, it turned out that most barons of the realm were unwilling to cooperate with Aimery's brother, Guy, who was the designated heir to Baldwin IV. The ailing king dismissed Guy and made his five-year-old nephew (Guy's stepson), <a href="Baldwin%20V%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin V</a>, his co-ruler on 20 November 1183.

In early 1185, Baldwin IV decreed that the <a href="pope">pope</a>, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> and the kings of France and England were to be approached to choose between his sister, Sybilla, and their half-sister, <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Jerusalem">Isabella</a>, if Baldwin V died before reaching the age of majority. The leper king died in April or May 1185, his nephew in late summer of 1186. Ignoring Baldwin IV's decree, Sybilla was proclaimed queen by her supporters and she crowned her husband, Guy, king. Aimery was not listed among those who were present at the ceremony, but he obviously supported his brother and sister-in-law, according to Hamilton.

As constable, Aimery organised the army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem into units before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a>, which ended with the decisive victory of Saladin on 4 July 1187. Along with most commanders of the Christian army, Aimery fell into captivity in the battlefield. During the siege of <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>, Saladin promised the defenders that he would set free ten persons whom they named if they surrendered. Aimery and Guy were among those whom the defenders named before surrendering on 4 September, but Saladin postponed their release until the spring of 1188.

Aimery remained a loyal supporter of his brother even after Guy had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem with the death of Sybilla and their two daughters in the autumn of 1190, according to most barons of the realm. Guy's opponents supported <a href="Conrad%20of%20Montferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a> who married Sybilla's half-sister, Isabella in late November. An assembly of the noblemen of the realm unanimously declared Conrad the lawful king on 16 April 1192. Although Conrad was murdered twelve days later, his widow soon married <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Henry of Champagne</a>, who was elected king of Jerusalem. To compensate Guy for the loss of Jerusalem, <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I of England</a> authorized him to purchase the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> (that Richard had conquered in May 1191) from the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>. He was also to pay 40,000 <a href="bezant">bezant</a>s to Richard who donated the right to collect the sum from Guy to Henry of Champagne. Guy settled in Cyprus in early May.

Aimery remained in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was reduced to a narrow strip of land along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea from <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> to <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a>. Henry of Champagne ordered the expulsion of the merchants from <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> from <a href="Acre">Acre</a> in May, because he accused them of plotting with Guy of Lusignan. After Aimery intervened on behalf of the merchants, the king had him arrested. Aimery was only released at the demand of the <a href="Grand%20Master%20%28order%29">grand master</a>s of the Templars and the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Hospitallers</a>. He retired to Jaffa that Richard of England had granted to Aimery's eldest brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan.

Guy of Lusignan died in May 1194, and bequeathed Cyprus to his elder brother, Geoffrey. However, Geoffrey had already returned to Poitou, thus Guy's vassals elected Aimery their new lord. Henry of Champagne demanded the right to be consulted about the succession in Cyprus, but the Cypriote noblemen ignored him. Around the same time, Henry of Champagne replaced Aimery with <a href="John%20of%20Ibelin%2C%20the%20Old%20Lord%20of%20Beirut">John of Ibelin</a> as constable of Jerusalem.

Aimery realized that the treasury of Cyprus was almost empty, because his brother had granted most landed property in the island to his supporters, according to Ernoul. He summoned his vassals to an assembly. After emphasizing that each of them owned more land than he had, he persuaded them one by one "either by force, or by friendship, or by agreement" to surrender some their rents and lands.

Aimery dispatched an embassy to <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20III">Pope Celestine III</a>, asking him to set up Roman Catholic dioceses in Cyprus. He also sent his representative, <a href="Rainier%20of%20Jebail">Rainier of Jebail</a>, to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry VI</a>, proposing that he would acknowledge the emperor's suzerainty, if the emperor sent a royal crown to him. Aimery primarily wanted to secure the emperor's assistance against a potential <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> invasion of Cyprus, but he also wanted to strengthen his own legitimacy as king. Rainier of Jebail swore loyalty to Henry VI on behalf of Aimery in <a href="Gelnhausen">Gelnhausen</a> in October 1196. The emperor who had decided to lead a crusade to the Holy Land promised that he would personally crown Aimery king. He dispatched the archbishops of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Brindisi-Ostuni">Brindisi</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Trani-Barletta-Bisceglie">Trani</a> to take a golden <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> to Aimery as a symbol of his right to rule Cyprus.

Henry VI's two envoys landed in Cyprus in April or May 1196. Aimery may have adopted the title of king around that time, because Pope Celestin styled him as king already in a letter in December 1196. In the same month, the pope set up a <a href="Latin%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Nicosia">Roman Catholic archdiocese in Nicosia</a> with three <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s in <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Famagusta">Famagusta</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Nemosia">Limassol</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Paphos">Paphos</a>. The <a href="Church%20of%20Cyprus">Greek Orthodox bishops</a> were not expelled, but their property and income was seized by the new Catholic prelates.

Henry VI's <a href="Archchancellor">chancellor</a>, <a href="Conrad%20of%20Querfurt">Conrad</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hildesheim">Bishop of Hildesheim</a>, crowned Aimery king in <a href="Nicosia">Nicosia</a> in September 1197. Aimery did homage to the chancellor. The noblemen who owned fiefs in both Cyprus and the Kingdom of Jerusalem wanted to bring about a reconciliation between Aimery and Henry of Champagne. One of them, <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Beisan">Baldwin of Beisan</a>, Constable of Cyprus, persuaded Henry of Champage to visit Cyprus in early 1197. The two kings made peace, agreeing that Aimery's three sons were to marry Henry's three daughters. Henry also renounced the debt that Aimery still owed to him for Cyprus and allowed Aimery to garrison his troops at Jaffa. Aimery sent <a href="Reynald%20Barlais">Reynald Barlais</a> to take possession of Jaffa. Aimery again used the title of Constable of Jerusalem in November 1197, which suggests that he had also recovered that office as a consequence of his treaty with Henry of Champagne.

Henry of Champagne fell from the window of his palace and died in Acre on 10 September 1197. The aristocratic, but impoverished <a href="Raoul%20of%20Saint%20Omer">Raoul of Saint Omer</a> was one of the possible candidates to succeed him, but the grand masters of the military orders opposed him vehemently. A few days later, <a href="Al-Adil%20I">Al-Adil I</a>, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, occupied Jaffa.

<a href="Conrad%20of%20Wittelsbach">Conrad of Wittelsbach</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Mainz">Archbishop of Mainz</a>, who arrived to Acre on 20 September, was the first to propose that the crown should be offered to Aimery. Since Aimery's first wife had died, he could marry the widowed Isabella I of Jerusalem, who was the queen. Although <a href="Aimaro%20Monaco%20dei%20Corbizzi">Aymar</a>, <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, stated that the marriage would be uncanonical, <a href="Joscius%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Tyre">Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre</a>, started negotiations with Aimery who accepted the offer. The patriarch also withdrew his objections and crowned Aimery and Isabella king and queen in Tyre in January 1198. (Runciman and other modern historians erroneously refer to him as Amalric II of Jerusalem, because they confused his name with that of Amalric "I" of Jerusalem.)

The Cypriot army fought for the Kingdom of Jerusalem during Aimery's rule, but otherwise he administered his two realms separately. Even before his coronation, Aimery united his forces with the German crusaders who were under the command of <a href="Henry%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brabant">Henry I, Duke of Brabant</a> to launch a campaign against the Ayyubid troops. They forced Al-Adil to withdraw and captured <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> on 21 October. He laid siege to <a href="Toron">Toron</a>, but he had to lift the siege on 2 February, because the German crusaders decided to return to the Holy Roman Empire after learning that Emperor Henry VI had died.

Aimery was riding at Tyre when four German knights attacked him in March 1198. His retainers rescued him and captured the four knights. Aimery accused Raoul of Saint Omer of hiring the assailants and sentenced him to banishment without a trial by his peers. At Raoul's demand, the case was submitted to the High Court of Jerusalem which held that Aimery had unlawfully banished Raoul. Nevertheless, Raoul voluntarily left the kingdom and settled in <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a>, because he knew that he had lost Aimery's goodwill.

Aimery signed a truce with Al-Adil on 1 July 1198, securing the possession of the coast from Acre as far as to <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> for the crusaders for five years and eight months. The Byzantine Emperor, <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios III Angelos</a>, did not abandon the idea of recovering Cyprus. He promised that he would help a new crusade if <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a> excommunicated Aimery to enable a Byzantine invasion in 1201, but the pope refuted him, emphasizing that the Byzantines had lost their right to Cyprus when Richard I conquered the island in 1191.

Aimery kept the peace with the Muslims, even when <a href="Reynald%20II%20of%20Dampierre">Reynald II of Dampierre</a>, who arrived at the head of 300 French crusaders demanded him to launch a campaign against the Muslims in early 1202. After Aimery reminded him that more than 300 soldiers were needed to wage war against the Ayyubids, Reynald left the Kingdom of Jerusalem for the <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Principality of Antioch</a>. An Egyptian emir seized a fortress near Sidon and made plundering raids against the neighboring territory. After Al-Adil failed to stop the emir, Aimery's fleet captured 20 Egyptian ships and he broke into Al-Adil's realm. In retaliation, Al-Adil's son, <a href="Al-Mu%27azzam%20Isa">Al-Mu'azzam Isa</a> plundered the region of Acre. In May 1204, the fleet of Aimery sack a small town at the Nile Delta in Egypt. The envoys of Aimery and Al-Adil signed a new truce for six years in September 1204. Al-Adil ceded Jaffa and <a href="Ramleh">Ramleh</a> to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and simplified the Christian pilgrims' visits in Jerusalem and <a href="Nazareth">Nazareth</a>.

After eating excess of <a href="white%20mullet">white mullet</a>, Aimery fell seriously ill. He died after a short illness on 1 April 1205. His six-year-old son, Hugh I, succeeded him in Cyprus; and his widow continued to rule the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Historian Mary Nickerson Hardwicke described Aimery as a "self-assured, politically astute, sometimes hard, seldom sentimentally indulgent" ruler. His rule was a period of peace and consolidation. The lawyers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem especially held him in high esteem. He decided to revise the laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to specify royal prerogatives. John of Ibelin emphasized that Aimery had governed both Cyprus and Jerusalem "well and wisely" until his death.

Aimery's first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin, was the elder daughter of Baldwin of Ibelin, Lord of Mirabel and Ramleh, and Richelda of Beisan. Their children:

Aimery's second wife, Isabella I of Jerusalem, was the only daughter of Amalric I of Jerusalem and <a href="Maria%20Komnene%2C%20Queen%20of%20Jerusalem">Maria Komnene</a>. Their children:

Anthemius of Tralles

Anthemius of Tralles (, <a href="Medieval%20Greek">Medieval Greek</a>: , "Anthémios o Trallianós";  – 533  558) was a <a href="Ancient%20Greeks">Greek</a> from <a href="Tralles">Tralles</a> who worked as a <a href="Greek%20geometry">geometer</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20architecture">architect</a> in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, the capital of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. With <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a>, he designed the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> for <a href="Justinian%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Justinian I</a>.
Anthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician. His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted <a href="Roman%20law">lawyer</a>; and Metrodorus worked as a <a href="Grammarian%20%28Greco-Roman%20world%29">grammarian</a> in Constantinople.

Anthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor Zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the <a href="joist">joist</a>s and flooring of Zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating <a href="thunder">thunder</a> and <a href="lightning">lightning</a> and flashing intolerable light into Zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror. In addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited Anthemius with a knowledge of <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> or other explosive compound.

Anthemius was a capable <a href="Greek%20mathematics">mathematician</a>. In the course of his treatise "On <a href="Burning%20Glass">Burning Glass</a>es", intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a> and assumed a property of ellipses not found in <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius of Perga</a>'s "Conics": the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. His work also includes the first practical use of the <a href="directrix%20%28conic%20section%29">directrix</a>: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a <a href="parabola">parabola</a>. This work was later known to <a href="Mathematics%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Arab mathematicians</a> such as <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Optics">Alhazen</a>.

Eutocius's commentary on Apollonius's "Conics" was dedicated to Anthemius.
As an architect, Anthemius is best known for his work designing the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. He was commissioned with <a href="Isidore%20of%20Miletus">Isidore of Miletus</a> by <a href="Justinian%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Justinian I</a> shortly after the earlier church on the site burned down in 532 but died early on in the project. He is also said to have repaired the flood defenses at <a href="Dara%20%28Mesopotamia%29">Daras</a>.

Absalon

Absalon or Axel (21 March 1201) was a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> and statesman, who was the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Roskilde">Bishop of Roskilde</a> from 1158 to 1192 and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Lund">Archbishop of Lund</a> from 1178 until his death. He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century, and was the closest advisor of King <a href="Valdemar%20I%20of%20Denmark">Valdemar I of Denmark</a>. He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, <a href="Europeanization">Europeanization</a> in close relationship with the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. He combined the ideals of <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a> with loyal support of a strong <a href="monarch">monarch</a>ical power.

Absalon was born into the powerful "<a href="Hvide">Hvide</a>" clan, and owned great land possessions. He endowed several church institutions, most prominently his family's <a href="Sor%C3%B8%20Abbey">Sorø Abbey</a>. He was granted lands by the crown, and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. His titles were passed on to his nephews <a href="Anders%20Sunesen">Anders Sunesen</a> and <a href="Peder%20Sunesen">Peder Sunesen</a>. He died in 1201, and was interred at Sorø Abbey.

Absalon was born around 1128 near <a href="Sor%C3%B8">Sorø</a>, <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a>. Due to a name which is unusual in Denmark, it is speculated that he was christened on the Danish "Absalon" <a href="name%20day">name day</a>, October 30. He was the son of <a href="Asser%20Rig">Asser Rig</a>, a <a href="magnate">magnate</a> of the "<a href="Hvide">Hvide</a>" clan from Fjenneslev on <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a>, and <a href="Inger%20Eriksdotter">Inger Eriksdotter</a>. He was also a kinsman of <a href="Eskil%20of%20Lund">Archbishop Eskil of Lund</a>. He grew up at the castle of his father, and was brought up alongside his older brother <a href="Esbern%20Snare">Esbern Snare</a> and the young prince Valdemar, who later became King <a href="Valdemar%20I%20of%20Denmark">Valdemar I of Denmark</a>. During the civil war following the death of <a href="Eric%20III%20of%20Denmark">Eric III of Denmark</a> in 1146, Absalon travelled abroad to study <a href="theology">theology</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, while Esbern fought for Valdemar's ascension to the throne. At Paris, he was influenced by the <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a> ideals of churchly independence from Monarchical rule. He also befriended the canon <a href="William%20of%20%C3%86belholt">William of Æbelholt</a> at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20St%20Genevieve">Abbey of St Genevieve</a>, whom he later made abbott of <a href="Eskils%C3%B8%20Abbey">Eskilsø Abbey</a>.

Absalon first appears in <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a>'s contemporary chronicle "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>" at the end of the civil war, at the brokering of the peace agreement between <a href="Sweyn%20III%20of%20Denmark">Sweyn III</a> and Valdemar at <a href="St.%20Alban%27s%20Priory%2C%20Odense">St. Alban's Priory, Odense</a>. He was a guest at following <a href="Roskilde">Roskilde</a> banquet given in 1157 by Sweyn to his rivals <a href="Canute%20V%20of%20Denmark">Canute V</a> and Valdemar. Both Absalon and Valdemar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of Sweyn on this occasion, and escaped to <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>, whither Sweyn followed them. Absalon probably did not take part in the following <a href="battle%20of%20Grathe%20Heath">battle of Grathe Heath</a> in 1157, in which Sweyn was defeated and slain and led to Valdemar ascending the Danish throne. On <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> 1158, bishop <a href="Asser%20of%20Roskilde">Asser of Roskilde</a> died, and Absalon was eventually elected <a href="Roskilde%20%28titular%20see%29">bishop of Roskilde</a> on Zealand with the help of Valdemar, as the king's reward for the "Hvide" family support.

Absalon was a close counsellor of Valdemar, and chief promoter of the Danish <a href="crusade">crusade</a>s against the <a href="Wends">Wends</a>. During the Danish civil war, Denmark had been open to coastal raids by the Wends. It was Absalon's intention to clear the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> of the Wendish pirates who inhabited its southern <a href="littoral%20zone">littoral zone</a> which was later called <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>. The pirates had raided the Danish coasts during the civil war of Sweyn III, Canute V, and Valdemar, to the point where at the accession of Valdemar one-third of Denmark lay wasted and depopulated. Absalon formed a guardian fleet, built coastal defenses, and led several campaigns against the Wends. He even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of Valdemar, which helped stabilize Denmark internally.

The first expedition against the <a href="Wends">Wends</a> that was conducted by Absalon in person, set out in 1160. These expeditions were successful, but brought no lasting victories. What started out as mere retribution, eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious motives. In 1164 began twenty years of crusades against the Wends, sometimes with the help of German duke <a href="Henry%20the%20Lion">Henry the Lion</a>, sometimes in opposition to him.

In 1168 the chief Wendish fortress at <a href="Cape%20Arkona">Arkona</a> in <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a>, containing the sanctuary of their god <a href="Svetovid">Svantevit</a>, was conquered. The Wends agreed to accept Danish suzerainty and the <a href="Christian%20religion">Christian religion</a> at the same time. From Arkona, Absalon proceeded by sea to <a href="Charenza">Charenza</a>, in the midst of Rügen, the political capital of the Wends and an all but impregnable stronghold. But the unexpected fall of Arkona had terrified the garrison, which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the Danish ships. Absalon, with only <a href="Sweyn%20of%20Aarhus">Bishop Sweyn of Aarhus</a>, and twelve "<a href="housecarl">housecarl</a>s" thereupon disembarked, passed between a double row of Wendish warriors, 6000 strong, along the narrow path winding among the morasses, to the gates of the fortress, and, proceeding to the temple of the seven-headed god <a href="Rugiewit">Rugievit</a>, caused the idol to be hewn down, dragged forth and burnt. The whole population of <a href="Garz/R%C3%BCgen">Garz</a> was then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen. Rügen was then subjected to Absalon's Bishopric of Roskilde.

The destruction of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet. But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at <a href="Dziwn%C3%B3w">Dziwnów</a> on the isle of <a href="Wolin">Wolin</a>. Absalon's last military exploit came in 1184, off <a href="Stralsund">Stralsund</a> at <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a>, when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmark's vassal, <a href="Jaromar%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20R%C3%BCgen">Jaromar of Rügen</a>.

Absalon's main political goal was to free Denmark from entanglements with the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. Absalon reformed the Danish church organisation to closer match <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> praxis, and worked to keep Denmark a close ally of the Holy See. However, during the <a href="Schism%20%28religion%29">schism</a> between <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> and <a href="Antipope%20Victor%20IV%20%281159%E2%80%931164%29">Antipope Victor IV</a>, Absalon stayed loyal to Valdemar even as he joined the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barberossa</a> in supporting Victor IV. This caused a split within the Danish church, as it possibly forced Eskil into exile around 1161, despite Abaslon's attempts to keep the Danish church united. It was contrary to Absalon's advice and warnings that Valdemar I rendered <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to the emperor Frederick Barbarossa at <a href="Dole%2C%20Jura">Dole</a> in 1162. When Valdemar returned to Denmark, he was convinced into strengthening the <a href="Danevirke">Danevirke</a> fortifications at the German border, with the support of Absalon.

Absalon built churches and monasteries, supporting international religious orders like the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercians</a> and <a href="Augustinians">Augustinians</a>, founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment. In 1162, Absalon transformed the <a href="Sor%C3%B8%20Abbey">Sorø Abbey</a> of his family from <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> to Cistercian, granting it lands from his personal holdings. In 1167, Absalon was granted the land around the city of "Havn" (English: Harbour), and built there a castle in the coastal defense against the Wends. Havn quickly expanded as one of <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>'s most important centers of trade, and eventually evolved into modern-day <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. It was also Absalon who held the first Danish <a href="Synod">Synod</a> at <a href="Lund">Lund</a> in 1167. He was also interested in history and culture, and commissioned <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> to write "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>", a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the Danes. In 1171, Absalon issued the "Zealand church law" (), which reduced the number of <a href="Canonical%20Law">Canonical Law</a> offenses for which the church could fine the public, while instituting the <a href="tithe">tithe</a> payment system. Eventual violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process.

Archbishop Eskil returned from exile in 1167. Eskil agreed on <a href="canonization">canonizing</a> Valdemar's father <a href="Knud%20Lavard">Knud Lavard</a> in 1170, with Absalon assisting him at the feast. When Eskil stepped down as Archbishop of Lund in 1177, he chose Absalon as his successor. Absalon initially resisted the new position, as he did not want to lose his power position on Zealand, but complied with Papal orders to do so in 1178. By a unique Papal dispensation, Absalon was allowed to simultaneously maintain his post as Bishop of Roskilde. As the Archbishop of Lund, Absalon utilized <a href="ombudsman">ombudsmen</a> from Zealand, demanded <a href="unfree%20labour">unfree labour</a> from the <a href="peasantry">peasantry</a>, and instituted tithes. He was a harsh and effective ruler, who cleared all <a href="Orthodox%20Christian">Orthodox Christian</a> <a href="Liturgy">liturgic</a> remnants in favour of Papal standards. A rebellion in the <a href="Scania">Scania</a>n peasantry forced him to flee to Zealand in 1180, from where he returned and subdued the Scanians with the help of Valdemar.

When Valdemar died in 1182, his son succeeded him as <a href="Canute%20VI%20of%20Denmark">Canute VI</a>, and Absalon served as Canute VI's counsellor. Under Canute VI, Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics. Absalon kept his hostile attitude to the Holy Roman Empire. On the accession of Canute VI in 1182, an imperial ambassador arrived at Roskilde to get the new king to swear fealty to Frederick Barbarossa, but Absalon resolutely withstood him.

When Absalon retired from military service in 1184 at the age of fifty-seven, he resigned the command of fleets and armies to younger men, like Duke Valdemar, the later king <a href="Valdemar%20II%20of%20Denmark">Valdemar II</a>. He instead confined himself to the administration of the Danish empire. In 1192, Absalon made his nephew <a href="Peder%20Sunesen">Peder Sunesen</a> his successor as Bishop of Roskilde, while his other nephew <a href="Anders%20Sunesen">Anders Sunesen</a> was named the <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> of Canute VI. Absalon died at Sorø Abbey on March 21, 1201, 73 years old, with his last will granting his personal holdings to the Abbey, apart from Fjenneslev which went to Esbern Snarre. He had already given Copenhagen to the Bishopric of Roskilde. Absalon was interred at Sorø Abbey, and was succeeded as Archbishop of Lund by Anders Sunesen.

Saxo Grammaticus' "Gesta Danorum" was not finished until after the death of Absalon, but Absalon was one of the chief heroic figures of the chronicle, which was to be the main source of knowledge about early Danish history. Absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the 12th century. Absalon was equally great as churchman, statesman and warrior. His policy of expansion was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic for three generations. That he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt; yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, whose sole indication of their religious role was to avoid the "shedding of blood" by using a mace in battle instead of a sword. Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties.

In the 2000s, "Absalon" was adopted as the name for a class of <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Navy">Royal Danish Navy</a> vessels, and the lead vessel of the class. <a href="HDMS%20Absalon%20%28L16%29">HDMS Absalon (L16)</a> and "Esbern Snare" (L17) were launched and commissioned by <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> in 2004 and 2005. In December 2008, "HDMS Absalon" was involved in the rescue of putative <a href="Somali%20pirates">Somali pirates</a> 90 miles off <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a>. The craft from <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> was reported to hold rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, and to have been adrift for several days. Also per the report, the "Absalon" took the sailors and weapons aboard, sunk the craft, and turned the sailors over to the Yemen coast guard. The "Absalon", according to "The New York Times" report, "was deployed in the Gulf of Aden [in] September ['08] as part of an international effort to curb piracy," part of <a href="Combined%20Task%20Force%20150">Combined Task Force 150</a>.

Adhemar of Le Puy

Adhemar (also known as Adémar, Aimar, or Aelarz) de Monteil (died 1 August 1098) was one of the principal figures of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> and was <a href="bishop%20of%20Puy-en-Velay">bishop of Puy-en-Velay</a> from before 1087. He was the chosen representative of <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Pope Urban II</a> for the expedition to the Holy Land. Remembered for his martial prowess, he led knights and men into battle and fought beside them, particularly at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dorylaeum%20%281097%29">Dorylaeum</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Antioch">Antioch</a>. Adhemar is said to have carried the <a href="Holy%20Lance">Holy Lance</a> in the Crusaders’ desperate breakout at Antioch on 28 June 1098, in which superior Islamic forces under the atabeg Kerbogha were routed, securing the city for the Crusaders.

Born around 1045 into the family of the <a href="County%20of%20Valentinois">Counts of Valentinois</a> and elected Bishop of Le Puy around 1080, he was an advocate of the <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a>, and among his supporters were the future <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Pope Urban II</a> and <a href="Raymond%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond of Saint-Gilles</a>, Count of Toulouse and the richest, most powerful nobleman in France. He was also said to have gone on pilgrimage to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> around 1086.

At the <a href="Council%20of%20Clermont">Council of Clermont</a> in 1095, Adhemar showed great zeal for the crusade (there is evidence that Urban II had conferred with Adhemar before the council). Adhemar was named <a href="apostolic%20legate">apostolic legate</a> and appointed to lead the crusade by Pope Urban II on 27 November 1095. In part, Adhemar was selected to lead because he had already undertaken a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1086 and 1087. Departing on 15 August 1096, he accompanied <a href="Raymond%20IV%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond IV</a>, <a href="Count%20of%20Toulouse">Count of Toulouse</a>, in his <a href="Army%20of%20Raymond%20of%20Saint-Gilles">army</a> to the east. Whilst Raymond and the other leaders often quarrelled with each other over the leadership of the crusade, Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader of the crusade.

Adhemar negotiated with <a href="Alexius%20I%20Comnenus">Alexius I Comnenus</a> at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, reestablished some discipline among the crusaders at <a href="%C4%B0znik">Nicaea</a>, fought a crucial role at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dorylaeum%20%281097%29">Battle of Dorylaeum</a> and was largely responsible for sustaining morale during the <a href="siege%20of%20Antioch">siege of Antioch</a> through various religious rites including fasting and special observances of holy days. After the capture of <a href="Antioch">the city</a> in June 1098 and the subsequent siege led by <a href="Kerbogha">Kerbogha</a>, Adhemar organized a procession through the streets and had the gates locked so that the Crusaders, many of whom had begun to panic, would be unable to leave the city. He was extremely skeptical of <a href="Peter%20Bartholomew">Peter Bartholomew</a>'s discovery in Antioch of the <a href="Holy%20Lance">Holy Lance</a>, especially because he knew such a relic already existed in Constantinople; however, he was willing to let the Crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale. Adhemar was protected by a band of Crusaders led by <a href="Henry%20of%20Esch">Henry of Esch</a> to preserve the (albeit suspect) relic.

When Kerbogha was defeated, Adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 August 1098, probably of <a href="typhus">typhus</a>. The disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved and the march to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was delayed for months. However, the lower-class soldiers continued to think of Adhemar as a leader. Some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the <a href="siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281099%29">siege of Jerusalem</a> and reported that Adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. This was done and Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in 1099.

Alphonse, Count of Poitiers

Alphonse or Alfonso (11 November 122021 August 1271) was the <a href="Count%20of%20Poitou">Count of Poitou</a> from 1225 and <a href="Count%20of%20Toulouse">Count of Toulouse</a> (as Alphonse II) from 1249. As count of Toulouse, he also governed the <a href="Marquisate%20of%20Provence">Marquisate of Provence</a>.

Born at <a href="Poissy">Poissy</a>, Alphonse was a son of <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Louis VIII</a>, <a href="King%20of%20France">King of France</a> and <a href="Blanche%20of%20Castile">Blanche of Castile</a>. He was a younger brother of <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a> and an older brother of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Sicily">Charles I of Sicily</a>. In 1229, his mother, who was <a href="regent">regent</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a>, forced the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281229%29">Treaty of Paris</a> on <a href="Raymond%20VII%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond VII of Toulouse</a> after his rebellion. It stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry <a href="Joan%20of%20Toulouse">Joan of Toulouse</a>, daughter of Raymond VII of Toulouse, and so in 1237 Alphonse married her. Since she was Raymond's only child, they became rulers of <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> at Raymond's death in 1249.

By the terms of his father's will he received an "<a href="appanage">appanage</a>" of <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a> and <a href="Rulers%20of%20Auvergne">Auvergne</a>. To enforce this Louis IX won the <a href="battle%20of%20Taillebourg">battle of Taillebourg</a> in the <a href="Saintonge%20War">Saintonge War</a> together with Alphonse against a revolt allied with king Henry III of England, who also participated in the battle.

Alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother, St Louis, in 1248 (the <a href="Seventh%20Crusade">Seventh Crusade</a>) and in 1270 (the <a href="Eighth%20Crusade">Eighth Crusade</a>). For the first of these, he raised a large sum and a substantial force, arriving in <a href="Damietta">Damietta</a> on 24 October 1249, after the town had already been captured. He sailed for home on 10 August 1250. His father-in-law had died while he was away, and he went directly to Toulouse to take possession. There was some resistance to his accession as count, which was suppressed with the help of his mother Blanche of Castile who was acting as regent in the absence of Louis IX. The county of Toulouse, since then, was joined to Alphonse's "appanage".

In 1252, on the death of his mother, Blanche of Castile, Alphonse was joint regent with <a href="Charles%20of%20Anjou">Charles of Anjou</a> until the return of Louis IX. During that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281259%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1259, under which King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a> recognized his loss of continental territory to <a href="France">France</a> (including <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="Maine%20%28province%20of%20France%29">Maine</a>, <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, and <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>) in exchange for France withdrawing support from English rebels.

Aside from the crusades, Alphonse stayed primarily in Paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials' work, and a constant stream of messages. His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the <a href="Albigensian%20Crusade">Albigensian war</a> and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. He is remembered for founding the <a href="bastide">bastide</a> town of <a href="Villeneuve-sur-Lot">Villeneuve-sur-Lot</a> which straddles the <a href="River%20Lot">River Lot</a> and still contains many of its original structures, including one of the first bridges across the river. The charter known as "Alphonsine," granted to the town of <a href="Riom">Riom</a>, became the code of public law for <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a>. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money. He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.

When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade (the <a href="Eighth%20Crusade">Eighth Crusade</a>), Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother. This time, however, he did not return to France, dying while on his way back, probably at <a href="Savona">Savona</a> in Italy, on 21 August 1271.

Alphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. One possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 <a href="Parlement">Parlement</a> decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs. Alphonse's wife Joan (who died four days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of <a href="Raymond%20VII">Raymond VII</a>, Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Provençal and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274. One specific bequest in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the <a href="Comtat%20Venaissin">Comtat Venaissin</a> to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, was allowed, and it became a <a href="Papal%20States">Papal territory</a>, a status that it retained until 1791.

Alfonso Jordan

Alfonso Jordan (; ; ; ) (1103–1148) was the <a href="Count%20of%20Tripoli">Count of Tripoli</a> (1105–09), <a href="Count%20of%20Rouergue">Count of Rouergue</a> (1109–48) and <a href="Count%20of%20Toulouse">Count of Toulouse</a>, <a href="Margrave%20of%20Provence">Margrave of Provence</a> and <a href="Duke%20of%20Narbonne">Duke of Narbonne</a> (1112–48, as Alfons I).

He was the son of <a href="Raymond%20IV%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond IV of Toulouse</a> by his third wife, <a href="Elvira%20of%20Castile%2C%20Countess%20of%20Toulouse">Elvira of Castile</a>. He was born in the castle of Mont Pèlerin in <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a> while his father was on the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>. He was given the name "Jourdain" after being baptised in the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>.

Alfonso's father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, <a href="Guillaume%20Jourdain">William Jordan</a>, <a href="Count%20of%20Cerdagne">Count of Cerdagne</a>, until he was five. He was then taken to Europe, where his half-brother <a href="Bertrand%20of%20Toulouse">Bertrand</a> had given him the county of Rouergue. Upon Bertrand's death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence. 

In 1114, Duke <a href="William%20IX%20of%20Aquitaine">William IX of Aquitaine</a>, who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count <a href="William%20IV%20of%20Toulouse">William IV</a>, invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123. When at last successful, he was <a href="excommunicated">excommunicated</a> by <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20II">Pope Callixtus II</a> for having expelled the monks of <a href="Saint-Gilles%2C%20Gard">Saint-Gilles</a>, who had aided his enemies.
Alfonso next had to fight for his rights in Provence against Count <a href="Raymond%20Berengar%20III%20of%20Barcelona">Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona</a>. Not until September 1125 did their war end in "peace and concord" ("pax et concordia"). At this stage, Alfonso was master of the regions lying between the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> and the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, the <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a> and the sea. His ascendancy was, according to one commentator, an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished. 
In March 1126, Alfonso was at the court of <a href="Alfonso%20VII%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VII of León</a> when he acceded to the throne. 
According to the "<a href="Chronica%20Adefonsi%20imperatoris">Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris</a>", Alfonso and <a href="Suero%20Verm%C3%BAdez">Suero Vermúdez</a> took the city of <a href="Le%C3%B3n%2C%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> from opposition magnates and handed it over to Alfonso VII. Among those who may have accompanied Alfonso on one of his many extended stays in Spain was the troubadour <a href="Marcabru">Marcabru</a>.

About 1134 Alfonso seized the <a href="Viscount%20of%20Narbonne">viscounty of Narbonne</a> and ruled it during the minority of the Viscountess <a href="Ermengarde%20of%20Narbonne">Ermengarde</a>, only restoring it to her in 1143. 
In 1141 King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII</a> pressed the claim of Philippa on behalf of his wife, <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, even besieging Toulouse, but without result. 
That same year Alfonso Jordan was again in Spain, making a <a href="Way%20of%20Saint%20James">pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostela</a>, when he proposed a peace between the king of León and <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20of%20Navarre">García VI of Navarre</a>, which became the basis for subsequent negotiations.

In 1144, Alfonso again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the citizens of <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a> against <a href="Lord%20of%20Montpellier">their lord</a>. 
In 1145, <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> addressed a letter to him full of concern about a heretic named Henry in the diocese of Toulouse. 
Bernard even went there to preach against the heresy, an early expression of <a href="Catharism">Catharism</a>. 
A second time he was excommunicated; but in 1146 he took the cross (i.e., vowed to go on crusade) at a meeting in <a href="V%C3%A9zelay">Vézelay</a> called by Louis VII. 
In August 1147, he embarked for the near east on the <a href="Second%20Crusade">Second Crusade</a>.
He lingered on the way in Italy and probably in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, where he may have met the Emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Comnenus">Manuel I</a>.

Alfonso finally arrived at <a href="Acre%2C%20Palestine">Acre</a> in 1148. 
Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined. 
He died at <a href="Caesarea">Caesarea</a>, and there were accusations of poisoning, usually levelled against either by Eleanor of Aquitaine, the wife of Louis, or <a href="Melisende%20of%20Jerusalem">Melisende</a>, the mother of King <a href="Baldwin%20III%20of%20Jerusalem">Baldwin III of Jerusalem</a>. 
By his wife since 1125, Faydiva d'Uzès, he left two legitimate sons: <a href="Raymond%20V%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond</a>, who succeeded him, and Alfonso. His daughter <a href="Faidiva%20of%20Toulouse">Faydiva</a> (died 1154) married Count <a href="Humbert%20III%20of%20Savoy">Humbert III of Savoy</a>. He left two other daughters: the legitimate Agnes (died 1187) and the illegitimate Laurentia, who married Count <a href="Bernard%20III%20of%20Comminges">Bernard III of Comminges</a>.

Ambroise

Ambroise, sometimes Ambroise of Normandy, (flourished ) was a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> poet and chronicler of the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, author of a work called ", which describes in rhyming <a href="Old%20French%20language">Old French</a> verse the adventures of as a <a href="crusade">crusade</a>r. The poem is known to us only through one <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican</a> <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>, and long escaped the notice of historians.

The credit for detecting its value belongs to <a href="Gaston%20Paris">Gaston Paris</a>, although his edition (1897) was partially anticipated by the editors of the ", who published some selections in the twenty-seventh volume of their Scriptores (1885). Ambroise followed Richard I as a <a href="noncombatant">noncombatant</a>, and not improbably as a court-<a href="minstrel">minstrel</a>. He speaks as an eye-witness of the king's doings at <a href="Messina%2C%20Italy">Messina</a>, in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, at the <a href="siege%20of%20Acre%20%281189%E2%80%931191%29">siege of Acre</a>, and in the abortive campaign which followed the capture of that city.

Ambroise is surprisingly accurate in his <a href="chronology">chronology</a>; though he did not complete his work before 1195, it is evidently founded upon notes which he had taken in the course of his <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>. He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the <a href="Saracens">Saracens</a>, against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the "Polein" party which supported <a href="Conrad%20of%20Montferrat">Conrad of Montferrat</a> against <a href="Guy%20of%20Lusignan">Guy of Lusignan</a>. He is rather to be treated as a <a href="biographer">biographer</a> than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects. Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190–1192 in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>.

Books 2–6 of the "<a href="Itinerarium%20Regis%20Ricardi">Itinerarium Regis Ricardi</a>", a Latin prose narrative of the same events apparently compiled by Richard, a canon of Holy Trinity, London, are closely related to Ambroise's poem. They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work, but that can no longer be maintained.

Art Deco

Art Deco, sometimes referred to as Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for "Arts Décoratifs", from the <a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20D%C3%A9coratifs%20et%20Industriels%20Modernes">Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</a> (International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts) held in Paris in 1925. It combined <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.

Art Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>; the bright colors of <a href="Fauvism">Fauvism</a> and of the <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a>; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of <a href="Louis%20Philippe">Louis Philippe</a> and <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a>; and the exotic styles of <a href="Chinese%20art">China</a> and <a href="Japanese%20art">Japan</a>, <a href="Indian%20art">India</a>, <a href="Persian%20art">Persia</a>, <a href="Art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="ancient%20Maya%20art">Maya art</a>. It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The <a href="Chrysler%20Building">Chrysler Building</a> and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.

In the 1930s, during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the Art Deco style became more subdued. New materials arrived, including <a href="chrome%20plating">chrome plating</a>, <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> and <a href="plastic">plastic</a>. A sleeker form of the style, called <a href="Streamline%20Moderne">Streamline Moderne</a>, appeared in the 1930s; it featured curving forms and smooth, polished surfaces. Art Deco is one of the first truly international styles, but its dominance ended with the beginning of World War II and the rise of the strictly functional and unadorned styles of <a href="modernism">modernism</a> and the <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a> of architecture that followed.

Art Deco took its name, short for "Arts Décoratifs", from the <a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20D%C3%A9coratifs%20et%20Industriels%20Modernes">Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</a> held in Paris in 1925, though the diverse styles that characterize Art Deco had already appeared in Paris and <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> before World War I.

The term "arts décoratifs" was first used in France in 1858; published in the Bulletin de la Société française de photographie.

In 1868, "Le Figaro" newspaper used the term "objets d'art décoratifs" with respect to objects for stage scenery created for the <a href="Salle%20Le%20Peletier">Théâtre de l'Opéra</a>.

In 1875, furniture designers, textile, jewelry and glass designers and other craftsmen were officially given the status of artists by the French government. In response to this, the "École royale gratuite de dessin" (Royal Free School of Design) founded in 1766 under King <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> to train artists and artisans in crafts relating to the fine arts, was renamed the National School of Decorative Arts ("<a href="%C3%89cole%20nationale%20sup%C3%A9rieure%20des%20arts%20d%C3%A9coratifs">l'École nationale des arts décoratifs</a>"). It took its present name of ENSAD ("École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs") in 1927.

During the 1925 Exposition the architect <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> wrote a series of articles about the exhibition for his magazine "L'Esprit Nouveau" under the title, "1925 Expo: Arts Déco" which were combined into a book, "L'art décoratif d'aujourd'hui" (Decorative Art Today). The book was a spirited attack on the excesses of the colorful and lavish objects at the Exposition; and on the idea that practical objects such as furniture should have any decoration at all; his conclusion was that "Modern decoration has no decoration".

The shorthand title "Arts Deco" that Le Corbusier used in the articles and book was adapted in 1966 for title of the first modern exhibit on the subject, called "Les Années 25 : Art déco, Bauhaus, Stijl, Esprit nouveau", which covered the variety of major styles in the 1920s and 1930s. The term Art déco was then used in a 1966 newspaper article by Hillary Gelson in the Times (London, 12 November), describing the different styles at the exhibit.

Art Deco gained currency as a broadly applied stylistic label in 1968 when historian <a href="Bevis%20Hillier">Bevis Hillier</a> published the first major academic book on the style: "<a href="Art%20Deco%20of%20the%2020s%20and%2030s">Art Deco of the 20s and 30s</a>". Hillier noted that the term was already being used by art dealers and cites "The Times" (2 November 1966) and an essay named "Les Arts Déco" in "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" magazine (November 1967) as examples of prior usage. In 1971, Hillier organized an exhibition at the <a href="Minneapolis%20Institute%20of%20Arts">Minneapolis Institute of Arts</a>, which he details in his book about it, "The World of Art Deco".

The emergence of Art Deco was closely connected with the rise in status of decorative artists, who until late in the 19th century had been considered simply as artisans. The term "arts décoratifs" had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the "Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna" , was held in <a href="Turin">Turin</a> in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including "Arts et décoration" and "L'Art décoratif moderne". Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français, and later in the" <a href="Salon%20d%27automne">Salon d'automne</a>". French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco.

The Paris department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> silverware firm <a href="Christofle">Christofle</a>, glass designer <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Lalique">René Lalique</a>, and the jewelers <a href="Louis%20Cartier">Louis Cartier</a> and <a href="Boucheron">Boucheron</a>, who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, the Department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 <a href="Salon%20d%27Automne">Salon d'Automne</a> had been entrusted to the department store <a href="Printemps">Printemps</a>. During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called "Primavera". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by <a href="Louis%20S%C3%BCe">Louis Süe</a> and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including <a href="%C3%89mile-Jacques%20Ruhlmann">Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann</a> and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a>, particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.

The <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20des%20Champs-%C3%89lys%C3%A9es">Théâtre des Champs-Élysées</a> (1910–1913), by <a href="Auguste%20Perret">Auguste Perret</a> was the first landmark Art Deco building completed in Paris. Previously <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. <a href="Henri%20Sauvage">Henri Sauvage</a>, another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7 rue Trétaigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with plaques of Art Deco sculpture by <a href="Antoine%20Bourdelle">Antoine Bourdelle</a>, a dome by <a href="Maurice%20Denis">Maurice Denis</a>, paintings by <a href="%C3%89douard%20Vuillard">Édouard Vuillard</a>, and an Art Deco curtain <a href="Ker-Xavier%20Roussel">Ker-Xavier Roussel</a>. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a>. Perret and Sauvage became the leading Art Deco architects in Paris in the 1920s.

At its birth between 1910 and 1914, Art Deco was an explosion of colors, featuring bright and often clashing hues, frequently in floral designs, presented in furniture upholstery, carpets, screens, wallpaper and fabrics. Many colorful works, including chairs and a table by <a href="Maurice%20Dufrene">Maurice Dufrene</a> and a bright Gobelin carpet by <a href="Paul%20Follot">Paul Follot</a> were presented at the 1912 <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20des%20artistes%20d%C3%A9corateurs">Salon des artistes décorateurs</a>. In 1912–1913 designer Alfred Karbowsky made a floral chair with a parrot design for the hunting lodge of art collector <a href="Jacques%20Doucet%20%28fashion%20designer%29">Jacques Doucet</a>. The furniture designers Louis Süe and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mare">André Mare</a> made their first appearance at the 1912 exhibit, under the name of the "Atelier Française," combining colorful fabrics with exotic and expensive materials, including ebony and ivory. After World War I they became one of the most prominent French interior design firms, producing the furniture for the first-class salons and cabins of the French transatlantic ocean liners.

The vivid colors of Art Deco came from many sources, including the exotic set designs by <a href="Leon%20Bakst">Leon Bakst</a> for the Ballets Russes, which caused a sensation in Paris just before World War I. Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier <a href="Fauvism">Fauvism</a> movement led by <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>; others by the <a href="Orphism%20%28art%29">Orphism</a> of painters such as <a href="Sonia%20Delaunay">Sonia Delaunay</a>; others by the movement known as the Nabis, and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon, who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects. Bright colors were a feature of the work of fashion designer <a href="Paul%20Poiret">Paul Poiret</a>, whose work influenced both Art Deco fashion and interior design.

The art style known as <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a> appeared in France between 1907 and 1912, influencing the development of Art Deco. The Cubists, themselves under the influence of <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>, were interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials: the cylinder, the sphere, the cone.

In 1912, the artists of the <a href="Section%20d%27Or">Section d'Or</a> exhibited works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion, furniture and interior designers.

In the 1912 writings of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Vera">André Vera</a>. "Le Nouveau style", published in the journal "L'Art décoratif", he expressed the rejection of <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> forms (asymmetric, polychrome and picturesque) and called for "simplicité volontaire, symétrie manifeste, l'ordre et l'harmonie", themes that would eventually become common within Art Deco; though with time the Deco style was often extremely colorful and anything but simple.

In the "Art Décoratif" section of the 1912 Salon d'Automne, an architectural installation was exhibited known as the "<a href="La%20Maison%20Cubiste">La Maison Cubiste</a>". The facade was designed by <a href="Raymond%20Duchamp-Villon">Raymond Duchamp-Villon</a>. The decor of the house was by the firm of Louis Süe and André Mare, who had formed a company called the "Atlelier Français" in 1912. "La Maison Cubiste" was a furnished installation with a facade, a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a bedroom, a living room—the "Salon Bourgeois", where paintings by <a href="Albert%20Gleizes">Albert Gleizes</a>, <a href="Jean%20Metzinger">Jean Metzinger</a>, <a href="Marie%20Laurencin">Marie Laurencin</a>, <a href="Marcel%20Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>, <a href="Fernand%20L%C3%A9ger">Fernand Léger</a> and <a href="Roger%20de%20La%20Fresnaye">Roger de La Fresnaye</a> were hung. Thousands of spectators at the salon passed through the full-scale model.
The facade of the house, designed by Duchamp-Villon, was not very radical by modern standards; the lintels and pediments had prismatic shapes, but otherwise the facade resembled an ordinary house of the period. The rooms were furnished by Mare with neo-Louis XVI and Louis-Philippe style chairs and sofas that were updated with more angular features to make hem go with the Cubist paintings. The critic Emile Sedeyn described Mare's work in the magazine "Art et Décoration": "He does not embarrass himself with simplicity, for he multiplies flowers wherever they can be put. The effect he seeks is obviously one of picturesqueness and gaiety. He achieves it." The Cubist element was provided by the paintings. Despite its tameness, the installation was attacked by some critics as extremely radical, which helped make for its success. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 <a href="Armory%20Show">Armory Show</a>, New York, Chicago and Boston. Thanks largely to the exhibition, the term "Cubist" began to be applied to anything modern, from women's haircuts to clothing to theater performances.

The Cubist style continued within Art Deco, even as Deco branched out in many other directions. In 1927, Cubists <a href="Joseph%20Csaky">Joseph Csaky</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lipchitz">Jacques Lipchitz</a>, <a href="Louis%20Marcoussis">Louis Marcoussis</a>, <a href="Henri%20Laurens">Henri Laurens</a>, the sculptor <a href="Gustave%20Miklos">Gustave Miklos</a>, and others collaborated in the decoration of a Studio House, rue Saint-James, <a href="Neuilly-sur-Seine">Neuilly-sur-Seine</a>, designed by the architect Paul Ruaud and owned by the French fashion designer Jacques Doucet, also a collector of <a href="Post-Impressionist">Post-Impressionist</a> art by Henri Matisse and <a href="Cubist">Cubist</a> paintings (including "<a href="Les%20Demoiselles%20d%27Avignon">Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</a>", which he bought directly from Picasso's studio). Laurens designed the fountain, Csaky designed Doucet's staircase, Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel, and Marcoussis made a Cubist rug.

Besides the Cubist artists, Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house, including Pierre Legrain, who was in charge of organizing the decoration, and <a href="Paul%20Iribe">Paul Iribe</a>, Marcel Coard, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Groult">André Groult</a>, <a href="Eileen%20Gray">Eileen Gray</a> and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony, inspired by African art, and furniture covered with Morocco leather, crocodile skin and snakeskin, and patterns taken from African designs.

Art Deco was not a single style, but a collection of different and sometimes contradictory styles. In architecture, Art Deco was the successor to and reaction against Art Nouveau, a style which flourished in Europe between 1895 and 1900, and also gradually replaced the <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux-Arts</a> and <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> that were predominant in European and American architecture. In 1905 <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Grasset">Eugène Grasset</a> wrote and published "Méthode de Composition Ornementale, Éléments Rectilignes," in which he systematically explored the decorative (ornamental) aspects of geometric elements, forms, motifs and their variations, in contrast with (and as a departure from) the undulating Art Nouveau style of <a href="Hector%20Guimard">Hector Guimard</a>, so popular in Paris a few years earlier. Grasset stressed the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. The reinforced concrete buildings of Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage, and particularly the <a href="Theatre%20des%20Champs-Elysees">Theatre des Champs-Elysees</a>, offered a new form of construction and decoration which was copied worldwide.

In decoration, many different styles were borrowed and used by Art Deco. They included pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a>, <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27Homme">Musée de l'Homme</a> and the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20national%20des%20Arts%20d%27Afrique%20et%20d%27Oc%C3%A9anie">Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie</a>. There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>, <a href="Troy">Troy</a>, and the tomb of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>. Artists and designers integrated motifs from <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>, Asia, <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a> with <a href="Machine%20Age">Machine Age</a> elements.

Other styles borrowed included Russian <a href="Constructivism%20%28art%29">Constructivism</a> and Italian <a href="Futurism">Futurism</a>, as well as Orphism, <a href="Functionalism%20%28architecture%29">Functionalism</a>, and <a href="Modernism">Modernism</a> in general. Art Deco also used the clashing colors and designs of Fauvism, notably in the work of Henri Matisse and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Derain">André Derain</a>, inspired the designs of art deco textiles, wallpaper, and painted ceramics. It took ideas from the high fashion vocabulary of the period, which featured geometric designs, chevrons, zigzags, and stylized bouquets of flowers. It was influenced by discoveries in <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a>, and growing interest in the Orient and in African art. From 1925 onwards, it was often inspired by a passion for new machines, such as airships, automobiles and ocean liners, and by 1930 this influence resulted in the style called <a href="streamline%20moderne">streamline moderne</a>.

Art Deco was associated with both luxury and modernity; it combined very expensive materials and exquisite craftsmanship put into modernistic forms. Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewellry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s. Later, after the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the style changed and became more sober.

A good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer <a href="Jeanne%20Lanvin">Jeanne Lanvin</a>, designed by <a href="Armand-Albert%20Rateau">Armand-Albert Rateau</a> (1882-1938) made between 1922-25. It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965. The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris. The walls are covered with molded "lambris" below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on with bases and a plinth of sculpted wood. The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk. Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.

By 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs. The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928-30, now in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>, had a unique American feature. Since it was constructed during <a href="Prohibition">Prohibition</a>, when serving alcohol was prohibited, it included a secret bar hidden behind the panels.

By the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.

The event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the <a href="International%20Exhibition%20of%20Modern%20Decorative%20and%20Industrial%20Arts">International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts</a> which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925. This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the <a href="Grand%20Palais">Grand Palais</a> on the right bank to <a href="Les%20Invalides">Les Invalides</a> on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine. The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate. It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed. The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods.

The Hôtel du Riche Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by <a href="Jean%20Dupas">Jean Dupas</a>. The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style. While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of <a href="modernist%20architecture">modernist architecture</a>.

American skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night. The first New York skyscraper, the <a href="Woolworth%20Building">Woolworth Building</a>, in a neoclassical style, was completed in 1913, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Building (1924) had ionic and doric columns and a classical Doric hypostyle with a frieze. The <a href="American%20Radiator%20Building">American Radiator Building</a> by <a href="Raymond%20Hood">Raymond Hood</a> (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's <a href="Guardian%20Building">Guardian Building</a>, which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist <a href="Wirt%20C.%20Rowland">Wirt C. Rowland</a>, the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments.

The New York skyline was radically changed by the <a href="Chrysler%20Building">Chrysler Building</a> in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by <a href="William%20Van%20Alen">William Van Alen</a>. It was a giant seventy-seven floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles. The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco "gargoyles" in the form stainless steel radiator cap decorations. The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.

The Chrysler Building was followed by <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a> by <a href="William%20F.%20Lamb">William F. Lamb</a> (1931) and the RCA Building (now the <a href="Comcast%20Building">Comcast Building</a>) in <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a>, by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed the skyline of New York. The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design. Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities.The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style. Rockefeller Center added a new design element; several tall building grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.

In 1925 two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunard, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, <a href="The%20French%20Union%20of%20Modern%20Artists">The French Union of Modern Artists</a>, in 1929. Its members included architects <a href="Pierre%20Chareau">Pierre Chareau</a>, <a href="Francis%20Jourdain">Francis Jourdain</a>, <a href="Robert%20Mallet-Stevens">Robert Mallet-Stevens</a>, Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, <a href="Konstantin%20Melnikov">Konstantin Melnikov</a>; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers <a href="Jean%20Fouquet">Jean Fouquet</a> and <a href="Jean%20Puiforcat">Jean Puiforcat</a>. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.

The Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: "We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!" However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply "a machine to live in", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned. The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects. In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers. Even the Ruhlmann firm was forced to produce pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items. The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the <a href="French%20Economic%2C%20Social%20and%20Environmental%20Council">French Economic, Social and Environmental Council</a>) and the <a href="Palais%20de%20Chaillot">Palais de Chaillot</a> by <a href="Louis-Hippolyte%20Boileau">Louis-Hippolyte Boileau</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Carlu">Jacques Carlu</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Az%C3%A9ma">Léon Azéma</a>, and the <a href="Palais%20de%20Tokyo">Palais de Tokyo</a> of the <a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20et%20Techniques%20dans%20la%20Vie%20Moderne">1937 Paris International Exposition</a>; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>, which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.

After World War II the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and <a href="Mies%20Van%20der%20Rohe">Mies Van der Rohe</a>. A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a> after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as juke boxes. In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier. In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. <a href="Postmodern%20architecture">Postmodern architecture</a>, which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features. Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.

There was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco. Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers. His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner <a href="SS%20Normandie">SS "Normandie"</a>. His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor. The other painter closely associated with the style is <a href="Tamara%20de%20Lempicka">Tamara de Lempicka</a>. Born in Poland in an aristocratic family, she emigrated to Paris after the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. There she became a student of the artist Maurice Denis of the movement called "<a href="Les%20Nabis">Les Nabis</a>" and the Cubist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Lhote">André Lhote</a> and borrowed many elements from their styles. She painted almost exclusively portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style.

In the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the <a href="Federal%20Art%20Project">Federal Art Project</a> of the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools. There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to <a href="social%20realism">social realism</a>; they included <a href="Reginald%20Marsh%20%28artist%29">Reginald Marsh</a>, <a href="Rockwell%20Kent">Rockwell Kent</a> and the Mexican painter <a href="Diego%20Rivera">Diego Rivera</a>. The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the <a href="Detroit%20Institute%20of%20Arts">Detroit Institute of Arts</a>. Diego Rivera's mural "American Progress" for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of <a href="Lenin">Lenin</a>. When Rivera refused to remove Lenin, the painting was destroyed and a new mural was painted by the Spanish artist <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Sert">Josep Maria Sert</a>.

Most of the sculpture of the Art Deco period was, as the name suggests, purely decorative; it was designed not for museums, but to ornament office buildings, government buildings, public squares, and private salons. It was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building; the themes were usually chosen by the patron, and abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. It was frequently attached to facade of buildings, particularly over the entrance.

Allegorical sculptures of the dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle were the essential decorative feature of the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20des%20Champs-Elys%C3%A9es">Théâtre des Champs-Elysées</a> in Paris, in 1912. The sculptor <a href="Aristide%20Maillol">Aristide Maillol</a> reinvented the classical ideal for his statue of the River (1939), now at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York. In the 1930s, a whole team of sculptors made sculpture for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. The buildings of the Exposition were covered with low-relief sculpture, statues. <a href="Alfred%20Janniot">Alfred Janniot</a> made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo. The Paris City Museum of Modern Art, and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by <a href="Charles%20Malfray">Charles Malfray</a>, Henry Arnold, and many others.

In the United States, many European sculptors trained at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, came to work; they included <a href="Gutzon%20Borglum">Gutzon Borglum</a>, sculptor of Mount Rushmore <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>. Other American sculptors, including <a href="Harriet%20Whitney%20Frishmuth">Harriet Whitney Frishmuth</a>, had studied with <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a> in Paris. The 1929 stock market crash largely destroyed the market for monumental sculpture, but one grand project remained; the new Rockefeller Center. The American sculptors <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a> and <a href="Paul%20Manship">Paul Manship</a> designed heroic allegorical figures for facade and plaza. In San Francisco, <a href="Ralph%20Stackpole">Ralph Stackpole</a> provided sculpture for the facade of the new <a href="San%20Francisco%20Stock%20Exchange">San Francisco Stock Exchange</a> building.

One of the best known and certainly the largest Art Deco sculpture is the "<a href="Christ%20the%20Redeemer%20%28statue%29">Christ the Redeemer</a>" by the French sculptor <a href="Paul%20Landowski">Paul Landowski</a>, completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pompon">François Pompon</a> was a pioneer of modern stylized <a href="animalier">animalier</a> sculpture. He was not fully recognized for his artistic accomplishments until the age of 67 at the Salon d'Automne of 1922 with the work "Ours blanc", also known as "The White Bear", now in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20d%27Orsay">Musée d'Orsay</a> in Paris.

Many early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons. One genre of this sculpture was called the <a href="Chryselephantine">Chryselephantine</a> statuette, named for a style of ancient Greek temple statues made of gold and ivory. One of the best-known Art Deco salon sculptors was the Romanian-born <a href="Dem%C3%A9tre%20Chiparus">Demétre Chiparus</a>, who produced colorful small sculptures of dancers. Other notable salon sculptors included <a href="Ferdinand%20Preiss">Ferdinand Preiss</a>, <a href="Josef%20Lorenzl">Josef Lorenzl</a>, Alexander Kelety, Dorothea Charol and Gustav Schmidtcassel.

Parallel with these more neoclassical sculptors, more avant-garde and abstract sculptors were at work in Paris and New York. The most prominent were <a href="Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i">Constantin Brâncuși</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Csaky">Joseph Csaky</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Archipenko">Alexander Archipenko</a>, <a href="Henri%20Laurens">Henri Laurens</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lipchitz">Jacques Lipchitz</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Miklos">Gustave Miklos</a>, <a href="Jean%20Lambert-Rucki">Jean Lambert-Rucki</a>, <a href="Jan%20et%20Jo%C3%ABl%20Martel">Jan et Joël Martel</a>, <a href="Chana%20Orloff">Chana Orloff</a>, and <a href="Pablo%20Gargallo">Pablo Gargallo</a>.

The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret. The illustrations of <a href="Georges%20Barbier">Georges Barbier</a>, and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine "La Gazette du bon ton" perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>", "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" and "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was <a href="Ludwig%20Hohlwein">Ludwig Hohlwein</a>, who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.

During the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets. In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised. The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and <a href="Paul%20Colin%20%28artist%29">Paul Colin</a>, who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer <a href="Josephine%20Baker">Josephine Baker</a>. Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer <a href="Mistinguett">Mistinguett</a> and for <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>. Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was <a href="Cassandre%20%28artist%29">Cassandre</a>, who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS "Normandie" in 1935.

In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events.

The architectural style of art deco made its debut in Paris in 1903-04, with the construction of two apartment buildings in Paris, one by Auguste Perret on rue Trétaigne and the other on rue Benjamin Franklin by Henri Sauvage. The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">art nouveau</a> style. Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, 15 <a href="avenue%20Montaigne">avenue Montaigne</a>. Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the <a href="La%20Samaritaine">La Samaritaine</a> department store in Paris.

After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; <a href="Los%20Angeles%20City%20Hall">Los Angeles City Hall</a> combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek <a href="Mausoleum%20at%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</a>, while the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20railroad%20station">Los Angeles railroad station</a> combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture. Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a> and the intake towers of <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a>. In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the <a href="Palacio%20de%20Bellas%20Artes">Palacio de Bellas Artes</a> (Palace of Fine Arts) in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> by , the <a href="Mayakovskaya%20%28Moscow%20Metro%29">Mayakovskaya Metro Station</a> in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and the <a href="National%20Diet%20Building">National Diet Building</a> in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.

The Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS "Normandie", whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by <a href="Lalique">Lalique</a>.

The grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings. Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. An early example was the <a href="Fisher%20Building">Fisher Building</a> in Detroit, by <a href="Joseph%20Nathaniel%20French">Joseph Nathaniel French</a>; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics. ]The <a href="Guardian%20Building">Guardian Building</a> (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by <a href="Wirt%20Rowland">Wirt Rowland</a> (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters. The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the "Cathedral of Commerce". The Medical and Dental Building called <a href="450%20Sutter%20Street">450 Sutter Street</a> in San Francisco by <a href="Timothy%20Pflueger">Timothy Pflueger</a> was inspired by <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a> architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.

In France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the <a href="Palais%20de%20la%20Porte%20Dor%C3%A9e">Palais de la Porte Dorée</a> (1931) by <a href="Albert%20Laprade">Albert Laprade</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Jaussely">Léon Jaussely</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bazin">Léon Bazin</a>. The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the <a href="Paris%20Colonial%20Exposition%20of%201931">Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931</a>, to celebrate the people and products of French colonies. The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.

Many of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s. The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies. Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; <a href="Grauman%27s%20Egyptian%20Theater">Grauman's Egyptian Theater</a> in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian <a href="tomb">tomb</a>s and <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>s, while the <a href="Fox%20Theater%20%28Bakersfield%2C%20California%29">Fox Theater</a> in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall. The largest of all is <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> in New York City, which opened in 1932. Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons The interior design by <a href="Donald%20Deskey">Donald Deskey</a> used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality The <a href="Paramount%20Theater%20%28Oakland%2C%20California%29">Paramount Theater</a> in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe. The <a href="Grand%20Rex">Grand Rex</a> in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe. The <a href="Gaumont%20State%20Cinema">Gaumont State Cinema</a> in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The <a href="Paramount%20%28Shanghai%29">Paramount</a> Theater in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called "The gate of 100 pleasures"; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in <a href="Asmara">Asmara</a> in what is now <a href="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.

In the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called <a href="Streamline%20Moderne">Streamline Moderne</a> or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style. Buildings in the style were had rounded corners, long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the <a href="Mossehaus">Mossehaus</a> by <a href="Erich%20Mendelsohn">Erich Mendelsohn</a>, and later in the <a href="Hoover%20Building">Hoover Building</a>, an industrial complex in the London suburb of <a href="Perivale">Perivale</a>. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.

Decoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases. Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 André Vera published an essay in the magazine "L'Art Décoratif" calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers. A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the <a href="Fauvism">Fauves</a> and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry. This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies. It became sleeker and less ornamental. Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline moderne style. New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and <a href="bakelite">bakelite</a>, an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration.

Throughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building. Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dorée at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies. The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion. The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.

French furniture from 1910 until the early 1920s was largely an updating of French traditional furniture styles, and the art nouveau designs of <a href="Louis%20Majorelle">Louis Majorelle</a>, <a href="Charles%20Plumet">Charles Plumet</a> and other manufacturers. French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the <a href="Biedermeier">Biedermeier</a> style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufrene, André Groult, André Mare and Louis Süe took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and <a href="Louis%20Philippe">Louis Philippe</a> with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.

The painter André Mare and furniture designer <a href="Louis%20Su%C3%AB">Louis Suë</a> both participated the 1912 Salon. After the War the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the "Compagnie des Arts Française", but usually known simply as Suë and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of <a href="Jean%20Patou">Jean Patou</a>.The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.

The most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the "House of the Rich Collector", at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including <a href="ebony">ebony</a>, <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>, <a href="rosewood">rosewood</a>, <a href="Ambon%20Island">ambon</a> and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets. His furniture was based upon 18th century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.

<a href="Jules%20Leleu">Jules Leleu</a> was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the <a href="Elysee%20Palace">Elysee Palace</a>, and for the first-class cabins of the steamship "Normandie". his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture at the end of in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass. In Italy, the designer <a href="Gio%20Ponti">Gio Ponti</a> was famous for his streamlined designs. In the United States,

The costly and exotic furniture Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the "arts décoratif" style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced.

In the 1930s, furniture designs adapted to the form, with smoother surfaces and curved forms. The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.

Streamline was a variety of Art Deco which emerged during the mid-1930s. It was influenced by modern <a href="Aerodynamics">aerodynamic</a> principles developed for aviation and <a href="ballistics">ballistics</a> to reduce air friction at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as <a href="refrigerator">refrigerator</a>s, <a href="Fuel%20dispenser">gas pumps</a>, and buildings. One of the first production vehicles in this style was the <a href="Chrysler%20Airflow">Chrysler Airflow</a> of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent; meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II.

New industrial materials began to influence design of cars and household objects. These included <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a>, <a href="chrome%20plating">chrome</a>, and bakelite, an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances.

Ocean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the "Style Paquebot", or "Ocean Liner Style". The most famous example was the SS "Normandie", which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935. It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop. The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration. The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a>. It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings. A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners. The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.

In the 1920s and 1930s, designers including René Lalique and Cartier tried reduce the traditional dominance of <a href="diamonds">diamonds</a> by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires. They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory. Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw a large number of diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks. The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used <a href="platinum">platinum</a> instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones. Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black <a href="onyx">onyx</a>, which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.

Jewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers. to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.

Rapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.

The established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, <a href="Chaumet">Chaumet</a>, Georges Fouquet, <a href="Mauboussin">Mauboussin</a>, and <a href="Van%20Cleef%20%26amp%3B%20Arpels">Van Cleef & Arpels</a> all created jewellry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with <a href="jade">jade</a>, <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>, diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco. Raymond Templier designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. <a href="Gerard%20Sandoz">Gerard Sandoz</a> was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer René Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies of mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels. The jeweler <a href="Paul%20Brandt">Paul Brandt</a> contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. <a href="Jean%20Despres">Jean Despres</a> made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. <a href="Jean%20Dunand">Jean Dunand</a> was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.

Like the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Coty">François Coty</a>, but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners <a href="SS%20Ile%20de%20France">SS "Ile de France"</a> in 1927 and the SS "Normandie" in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.

Other notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals. For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light. His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers. His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.

Other notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and <a href="Maurice%20Marinot">Maurice Marinot</a>, who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases. The firm of <a href="Daum%20%28studio%29">Daum</a> from the city of <a href="Nancy%2C%20France">Nancy</a>, which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form. More delicate multicolored works were made by <a href="Gabriel%20Argy-Rousseau">Gabriel Argy-Rousseau</a>, who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.

The Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients. Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches. In 1937, the <a href="Steuben%20Glass%20Works">Steuben</a> glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware. <a href="Louis%20Majorelle">Louis Majorelle</a>, famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the <a href="Aci%C3%A9ries%20de%20Longwy">Aciéries de Longwy</a>, a steel mill in <a href="Longwy">Longwy</a>, France.

Art Deco artists produced a wide variety of practical objects in the Art Deco style, made of industrial materials from traditional wrought iron to chrome-plated steel. The American artist <a href="Norman%20Bel%20Geddes">Norman Bel Geddes</a> designed a cocktail set resembling a skyscraper made of chrome-plated steel. Raymond Subes designed an elegant metal grille for the entrance of the Palais de la Porte Dorée, the centerpiece of the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition. The French sculptor Jean Dunand produced magnificent doors on the theme "The Hunt", covered with gold leaf and paint on plaster (1935).

Art Deco architecture began in Europe, but by 1939 there were examples in large cities on every continent and in almost every country. This is a selection of prominent buildings on each continent. (For a comprehensive of existing buildings by country, see <a href="List%20of%20Art%20Deco%20architecture">List of Art Deco architecture</a>.)

Most Art Deco buildings in Africa were built during European colonial rule, and often designed by Italian and French architects.

A large number of the Art Deco buildings in Asia were designed by European architects, but in the Philippines local architect <a href="Juan%20Nakpil">Juan Nakpil</a> was preeminent. Many art deco landmarks in Asia were demolished during the great economic expansion of Asia the late 20th century, but some notable enclaves of the architecture still remain, particularly in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.

Art Deco buildings can be found throughout Central America. A particularly rich collection is found in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, built largely for the large number of tourists who came to the island from the United States.

The Art Deco in South America is present especially at the countries that received a great wave of immigration on the first half of the <a href="20th%20century">20th century</a>, with notable works at their richest cities, like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and Buenos Aires in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>.The <a href="Kavanagh%20building">Kavanagh building</a> in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> (1934), by Sánchez, Lagos and de la Torre, was the tallest reinforced concrete structure when it was completed, and a notable example of late Art Deco style.

The architectural style first appeared in Paris with the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–13) by Auguste Perret but then spread rapidly around Europe, until examples could be found in nearly every large city, from London to Moscow. In Germany two variations of Art Deco flourished in the 1920s and 30s: The <a href="New%20Objectivity%20%28architecture%29">Neue Sachlichkeit</a> style and <a href="Expressionist%20architecture">Expressionist architecture</a>. Notable examples include Erich Mendelsohn's Mossehaus and <a href="Schaub%C3%BChne">Schaubühne</a> theater in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Fritz%20H%C3%B6ger">Fritz Höger</a>'s <a href="Chilehaus">Chilehaus</a> in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and his <a href="Kirche%20am%20Hohenzollernplatz">Kirche am Hohenzollernplatz</a> in Berlin, the Anzeiger Tower in <a href="Hannover">Hannover</a> and the Borsig Tower in Berlin.

One of the largest Art Deco buildings in Western Europe is the <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart%2C%20Brussels">Basilica of the Sacred Heart</a> in Koekelberg, Brussels. In 1925, architect Albert van Huffel won the Grand Prize for Architecture with his scale model of the basilica at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris.

Spain and Portugal have some striking examples of Art Deco buildings, particularly movie theaters. Examples in Portugal are the Capitólio Theater (1931) and the Éden Cine-Theater (1937) in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, the <a href="Rivoli%20Theatre%20%28Portugal%29">Rivoli Theater</a> (1937) and the <a href="Coliseu%20do%20Porto">Coliseu</a> (1941) in <a href="Porto">Porto</a> and the Rosa Damasceno Theater (1937) in <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal">Santarém</a>. An example in Spain is the Cine Rialto in Valencia (1939).

During the 1930s, Art Deco had a noticeable effect on house design in the United Kingdom, as well as the design of various public buildings. Straight, white-rendered house frontages rising to flat roofs, sharply geometric door surrounds and tall windows, as well as convex-curved metal corner windows, were all characteristic of that period.

The <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> is famous for many examples of Art Deco architecture, and there are a number of buildings in the style situated along the <a href="Golden%20Mile%20%28Brentford%29">Golden Mile</a> in Brentford. Also in West London is the Hoover Building, which was originally built for <a href="The%20Hoover%20Company">The Hoover Company</a> and was converted into a superstore in the early 1990s.

In Canada Art Deco structures that survive are mainly in the major cities; <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, and <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. They range from public buildings like <a href="Vancouver%20City%20Hall">Vancouver City Hall</a> to commercial buildings (<a href="College%20Park%20%28Toronto%29">College Park</a>) to public works (<a href="R.%20C.%20Harris%20Water%20Treatment%20Plant">R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant</a>).

In <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, the most imposing Art Deco example is interior of the <a href="Palacio%20de%20Bellas%20Artes">Palacio de Bellas Artes</a> (Palace of Fine Arts), finished in 1934 with its elaborate decor and murals. Examples of Art Deco residential architecture can be found in the <a href="Condesa">Condesa</a> neighborhood, many designed by <a href="Francisco%20J.%20Serrano">Francisco J. Serrano</a>.

In the United States, Art Deco buildings are found from coast to coast, in all the major cities. It was most widely used for office buildings, train stations, airport terminals, and movie theaters; residential buildings are rare. In the 1930s, the more austere streamline style became popular. Many buildings were demolished between 1945 and the late 1960s, but then efforts began to protect the best examples. The City of Miami Beach established the <a href="Miami%20Beach%20Architectural%20District">Miami Beach Architectural District</a> to preserve the colorful collection of Art Deco buildings found there.

Melbourne and Sydney Australia have several notable Art Deco buildings, including the <a href="Manchester%20Unity%20Building">Manchester Unity Building</a> and the former <a href="Russell%20Street%20Police%20Headquarters">Russell Street Police Headquarters</a> in Melbourne, the Castlemaine Art Museum in <a href="Castlemaine%2C%20Victoria">Castlemaine</a>, central Victoria and the <a href="Grace%20Building%20%28Sydney%29">Grace Building,</a> <a href="AWA%20Tower">AWA Tower</a> and <a href="ANZAC%20War%20Memorial">ANZAC War Memorial</a> in Sydney. 

Several towns in New Zealand, including <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a> and <a href="Hastings%2C%20New%20Zealand">Hastings</a> were rebuilt in Art Deco style after the <a href="1931%20Hawke%27s%20Bay%20earthquake">1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake</a>, and many of the buildings have been protected and restored. Napier has been nominated for UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> status, the first cultural site in New Zealand to be nominated. <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> has retained a sizeable number of Art Deco buildings.

In many cities, efforts have been made to protect the remaining Art Deco buildings. In many U.S. cities, historic art deco movie theaters have been preserved and turned into cultural centers. Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument. The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style. In <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, Cuba, a large number of Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated. Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance.

In the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco, have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s. Examples include the <a href="Smith%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Smith Center for the Performing Arts</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, which includes art deco features from Hoover Dam, fifty miles away, and from the <a href="Will%20Rogers%20Memorial%20Center">Will Rogers Memorial Center</a> in <a href="Fort%20Worth">Fort Worth</a>, Texas, an art deco landmark built in 1936.

ASCII art

ASCII art is a <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a> technique that uses <a href="computer">computer</a>s for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) <a href="character%20%28computing%29">characters</a> defined by the <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard <a href="7-bit%20ASCII">7-bit ASCII</a>). The term is also loosely used to refer to <a href="%23Other%20text-based%20visual%20art">text based visual art in general</a>. ASCII art can be created with any <a href="text%20editor">text editor</a>, and is often used with <a href="free-form%20language">free-form language</a>s. Most examples of ASCII <a href="art">art</a> require a <a href="Proportional%20fonts">fixed-width font</a> (non-proportional <a href="typeface">fonts</a>, as on a traditional <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a>) such as <a href="Courier%20%28typeface%29">Courier</a> for presentation.

Among the oldest known examples of ASCII art are the
creations by computer-art pioneer <a href="Kenneth%20Knowlton">Kenneth Knowlton</a> from around 1966, who was working for <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> at the time. "Studies in Perception I" by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art.

ASCII art was invented, in large part, because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks. Also, to mark divisions between different print jobs from different users, bulk printers often used ASCII art to print large banners, making the division easier to spot so that the results could be more easily separated by a computer operator or clerk. ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded.

Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art.

TTY stands for "TeleTYpe" or "TeleTYpewriter" and is also known as <a href="Teleprinter">Teleprinter</a> or <a href="Teletype">Teletype</a>.
RTTY stands for <a href="Radioteletype">Radioteletype</a>; <a href="character%20set">character set</a>s such as <a href="Baudot%20code">Baudot code</a>, which predated ASCII, were used. According to a chapter in the "RTTY Handbook", text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923. However, none of the "old" RTTY art has been discovered yet. What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radioteletype in the 1960s and the 1970s.

In the 1960s, <a href="Andries%20van%20Dam">Andries van Dam</a> published a representation of an electronic circuit produced on an <a href="IBM%201403">IBM 1403</a> line printer. At the same time, <a href="Kenneth%20Knowlton">Kenneth Knowlton</a> was producing realistic images, also on line printers, by overprinting several characters on top of one another.
Note that it was not ASCII art in a sense that the 1403 was driven by an EBCDIC-coded platform and the character sets and trains available on the 1403 were derived from EBCDIC rather than ASCII, despite some glyphs commonalities.

The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images. Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.

During the 1990s, graphical browsing and <a href="variable-width%20font">variable-width</a> <a href="Computer%20font">fonts</a> became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art. Despite this, ASCII art continued to survive through online <a href="MUD">MUD</a>s, an acronym for "Multi-User Dungeon", (which are textual <a href="Multiplayer%20game">multiplayer</a> <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s), <a href="Internet%20Relay%20Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a>, <a href="E-mail">E-mail</a>, <a href="message%20boards">message boards</a> and other forms of online communication which commonly employ the needed <a href="fixed-width">fixed-width</a>.

ASCII and more importantly, <a href="ANSI%20escape%20code">ANSI</a> were staples of the early technological era; terminal systems relied on coherent presentation using color and control signals standard in the terminal protocols.

Over the years, <a href="warez">warez</a> groups began to enter the ASCII art scene. Warez groups usually release <a href=".nfo">.nfo</a> files with their software, <a href="Software%20cracking">cracks</a> or other general software reverse-engineering releases. The ASCII art will usually include the warez group's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes, etc.

<a href="Bulletin%20board%20system">BBS</a> systems were based on ASCII and ANSI art, as were most <a href="DOS">DOS</a> and similar <a href="System%20console">console</a> applications, and the precursor to <a href="AOL">AOL</a>.

ASCII art is used wherever text can be more readily printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a>s, non-graphic <a href="computer%20terminal">computer terminal</a>s, <a href="printer%20separator">printer separator</a>s, in early <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>ing (e.g., <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">BBSes</a>), <a href="e-mail">e-mail</a>, and <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> news messages. ASCII art is also used within the <a href="source%20code">source code</a> of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program is a piece of ASCII art – for instance, an entry to one of the earlier <a href="International%20Obfuscated%20C%20Code%20Contest">International Obfuscated C Code Contest</a> is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.

Some <a href="electronic%20schematic">electronic schematic</a> archives represent the circuits using ASCII art.

Examples of ASCII-style art predating the modern computer era can be found in the June 1939, July 1948 and October 1948 editions of Popular Mechanics.

"0verkill" is a 2D platform multiplayer shooter game designed entirely in color ASCII art. <a href="MPlayer">MPlayer</a> and <a href="VLC%20media%20player">VLC media player</a> can display videos as ASCII art through the <a href="AAlib">AAlib</a> library. ASCII art is used in the making of DOS-based <a href="ZZT">ZZT</a> games.

Many game walkthrough guides come as part of a basic .txt file; this file often contains the name of the game in ASCII art. Such as below, word art is created using backslashes and other ASCII values in order to create the illusion of 3D.

Different techniques could be used in ASCII art to obtain different artistic effects. Electronic circuits and diagrams were implemented by <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a> or <a href="teletype">teletype</a> and provided the pretense for ASCII.

"Typewriter-style" lettering, made from individual letter characters:
Line art, for creating shapes: 

Solid art, for creating filled objects:

Shading, using symbols with various intensities for creating gradients or contrasts:

Combinations of the above, often used as signatures, for example, at the end of an email:

As-Pixel Characters, use combinations of ░ , █ , ▄ and ▀ to make pictures:<br>

The simplest forms of ASCII art are combinations of two or three characters for expressing emotion in text. They are commonly referred to as '<a href="emoticon">emoticon</a>', 'smilie', or '<a href="smiley">smiley</a>'.

There is another type of one-line ASCII art that does not require the mental rotation of pictures, which is widely known in Japan as <a href="Emoticon%23Japanese%20style">kaomoji</a> (literally "face characters".) Traditionally, they are referred to as "ASCII face".

More complex examples use several lines of text to draw large symbols or more complex figures.

Hundreds of different text smileys were developed over time, but only a few were generally accepted, used and understood.

An ASCII comic is a form of <a href="webcomic">webcomic</a>.

The Adventures of Nerd Boy, or just Nerd Boy is an ASCII comic by Joaquim Gândara between 5 August 2001 and 17 July 2007, consisting of 600 strips. They were posted to ASCII art <a href="newsgroup">newsgroup</a> alt.ascii-art and on the website. Some strips have been translated to <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a>.

The <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 400/800</a> which were released in 1979 did not follow the ASCII standard and had its own character set, called <a href="ATASCII">ATASCII</a>. The emergence of ATASCII art coincided with the growing popularity of <a href="Bulletin%20board%20system">BBS Systems</a> caused by availability of the <a href="acoustic%20coupler">acoustic coupler</a>s that were compatible with the 8-bit home computers. ATASCII text animations are also referred to as "break animations" by the Atari sceners.

The <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, which was released in 1982, also did not follow the ASCII standard. The C-64 character set is called <a href="PETSCII">PETSCII</a>, an extended form of <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>-1963. As with the Atari's ATASCII art, C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations.

So-called "block ASCII" or "high ASCII" uses the extended characters of the 8-bit <a href="code%20page%20437">code page 437</a>, which is a proprietary standard introduced by <a href="IBM">IBM</a> in 1979 (ANSI Standard x3.16) for the IBM PC DOS and MS-DOS operating systems. "Block ASCIIs" were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform. Until then, "block ASCIIs" dominated the <a href="Computer%20art%20scene">PC Text Art Scene</a>.

The first art scene group that focused on the extended character set of the PC in their art work was called "Aces of ANSI Art," or "AAA." Some members left in 1990, and formed a group called <a href="ACiD%20Productions">ACiD</a>, "ANSI Creators in Demand." In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded, <a href="iCE%20Advertisements">ICE</a>, "Insane Creators Enterprise".

There is some debate between ASCII and block ASCII artist, with "Hardcore" ASCII artists maintaining that block ASCII art is in fact not <a href="ANSI%20art">ANSI art</a>, because it does not use the 128 characters of the original ASCII standard. On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.

Microsoft Windows does not support the <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">ANSI Standard</a> x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font "<a href="Terminal%20%28font%29">Terminal</a>", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that <a href="%23%26quot%3BBlock%26quot%3B%20ASCII%20art">illustrates the difference</a> in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.

In the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so-called "Oldskool" Style. It is also called "Amiga style", due to its origin and widespread use on the <a href="Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a> Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: _/\-+=.()<>:. The "oldskool" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.
This is an example of "<a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> style" (also referred to as "old school" or "oldskool" style) <a href="computer%20art%20scene">scene</a> ASCII art.

The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a>. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal (later known as "DeZign"). This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style "Oldskool". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.

The Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a <a href="ZIP%20archive">ZIP archive</a> with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called "ASCII collections" and not "art packs" like on the IBM PC.

This kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include <a href="CygnusEd">CygnusEd</a>itor a.k.a. CED (<a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>) and <a href="EditPlus">EditPlus</a>2 (<a href="Wintel">PC</a>).

<a href="Oldskool%20font">Oldskool font</a> example from the PC, which was taken from the ASCII Editor <a href="FIGlet">FIGlet</a>.

"Newskool" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like "$#Xxo". In spite of its name, the style is not "new"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by "Oldskool" and "Block" style ASCII art. It was dubbed "Newskool" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.

Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of <a href="Character%20encoding">extended proprietary characters</a>. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for "fine tuning" and "tweaking". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a>.

While some prefer to use a simple <a href="text%20editor">text editor</a> to produce ASCII art, specialized programs, such as <a href="JavE">JavE</a> have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because to generate the required characters on a standard keyboard, one needs to know the <a href="alt%20code">alt code</a> for each character. for example alt+178 will produce ▓, alt+177 will produce ▒ and, alt+8 will produce ◘.

The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as <a href="TheDraw">TheDraw</a> and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.

Other programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of <a href="vector%20quantization">vector quantization</a>. A method is to sample the image down to <a href="grayscale">grayscale</a> with less than <a href="integer%20%28computer%20science%29">8-bit</a> precision, and then assign a character for each value. Such ASCII art generators often allow users to choose the intensity and contrast of the generated image.

3 factors limit the fidelity of the conversion, especially of photographs:

Examples of converted images are given below.

This is one of the earliest forms of ASCII art, dating back to the early days of the 1960s <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a>s and <a href="teletype">teletype</a>s. During the 1970s it was popular in US <a href="shopping%20mall">malls</a> to get a <a href="t-shirt">t-shirt</a> with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer, and London's <a href="Science%20Museum%2C%20London">Science Museum</a> had a similar service to produce printed portraits. With the advent of the web and <a href="HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="Cascading%20Style%20Sheets">CSS</a>, many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full <a href="RGB%20color%20model">RGB</a> colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.

Still images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various UNIX and UNIX-Like systems using the <a href="http%3A//aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib">aalib (black and white)</a> or <a href="http%3A//caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca">libcaca (colour)</a> graphics device driver, or the <a href="VLC%20media%20player">VLC media player</a> or <a href="mpv%20%28media%20player%29">mpv</a> under <a href="Windows">Windows</a>, Linux or <a href="macOS">macOS</a>; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels. See also <a href="http%3A//oreilly.com/pub/h/4441">O'Reilly article "Watch Videos in ASCII art"</a>.

There are also a number of <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a> applications, such as ASCII cam for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>, that generate ASCII art in real-time using input from the phone's camera. These applications typically allow the ASCII art to be saved as either a text file or as an image made up of ASCII text.

Most ASCII art is created using a <a href="monospaced%20font">monospaced font</a>, where all characters are identical in width (<a href="Courier%20%28typeface%29">Courier</a> is a popular monospaced font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospaced fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as <a href="Helvetica">Helvetica</a> or <a href="Times%20Roman">Times Roman</a>, where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.

Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.

Animated ASCII art started in 1970 from so-called VT100 animations produced on <a href="VT100">VT100</a> terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.

Contemporary <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a> revitalized animated ASCII art again. It became possible to display animated ASCII art via <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> or <a href="Java%20%28Sun%29">Java applets</a>. Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another, creating the animation, very similar to how movie projectors unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters. A new term was born: "ASCIImation" – another name of Animated ASCII Art. A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation. More complicated routines in JavaScript generate more elaborate ASCIImations showing effects like <a href="Morphing">Morphing</a> effects, star field emulations, fading effects and calculated images, such as <a href="Mandelbrot%20set">mandelbrot fractal</a> animations.

There are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols; some of these tools can operate on streaming video. For example, the music video for American singer <a href="Beck">Beck</a>'s song "<a href="Black%20Tambourine">Black Tambourine</a>" is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage. <a href="VLC%20media%20player">VLC</a>, a media player software, can render any video in colored ASCII through the <a href="libcaca">libcaca</a> module.

There are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as "ASCII art". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or <a href="pseudo-graphics">pseudo-graphics</a>.

The IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages (<a href="Code%20page%20437">Code page 437</a> by default), 16 foreground colors, eight background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as <a href="ANSI%20art">ANSI art</a>. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the <a href="Windows%20ANSI%20code%20page">Windows ANSI code page</a>) have largely replaced DOS based ones.

A large character selection and the availability of fixed-width characters allow Japanese users to use <a href="Shift%20JIS">Shift JIS</a> as a text-based art on Japanese websites.

In Japan, ASCII-art (AA) is mainly known as Shift-JIS Art.

In other words, the word "ASCII" is used to refer to the <a href="ASCII%20%28company%29">ASCII Corporation</a>, rather than the <a href="American%20Standard%20Code%20for%20Information%20Interchange">American Standard Code for Information Interchange</a>.

<a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> would seem to offer the ultimate flexibility in producing text based art with its huge variety of characters. However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for <a href="xterm">xterm</a>. Windows has the <a href="Courier%20New">Courier New</a> font which includes characters like ┌╥─╨┐♥☺Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used. ≽ⱷ҅ⱷ≼ is an adequate representation of a cat's face in a font with varying character widths.

The <a href="combining%20character">combining character</a>s mechanism of <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> provides considerable ways of customizing the style, even <a href="obfuscation">obfuscating</a> the text (e.g. via an online generator like <a href="http%3A//obfuscator.uo1.net/">Obfuscator</a>, which focuses on the <a href="https%3A//stackoverflow.com/questions/3470669/should-unicode-be-allowed-in-usernames">filters</a>). Glitcher is one example of Unicode art, initiated in 2012: « "These symbols, intruding up and down, are made by combining lots of diacritical marks. It’s a kind of art. There’s quite a lot of artists who use the Internet or specific social networks as their canvas." » The corresponding creations are favored in web browsers (thanks to their always better <a href="http%3A//www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/%7Erichard/unicode-sample-3-2.html">support</a>), as <a href="geek">geek</a>ily stylized usernames for social networks. With a fair compatibility, and among different online tools, <a href="http%3A//fsymbols.com/generators/facebook-name/">Facebook symbols</a> showcases various types of Unicode art, mainly for aesthetic purpose (Ɯıḳĭƥḙȡḯả Wîkipêȡıẚ Ẉǐḳîṗȅḍȉā Ẃįḵįṗẻḑìẵ Ẉĭḵɪṕḗdïą Ẇïƙỉpểɗĭà Ẅȉḱïṕȩđĩẵ etc.). Besides, the creations can be hand-crafted (by programming), or pasted from mobile applications (e.g. the category of <a href="https%3A//play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3Dfancy%2520text%26amp%3Bc%3Dapps">'fancy text'</a> tools on Android). The underlying technique dates back to the old systems that incorporated <a href="control%20character">control character</a>s, though. E.g. the German composite codice_1 would be imitated on <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> by <a href="http%3A//www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap16.html">overwriting</a> codice_2 after <a href="backspace">backspace</a> and codice_3. (Cf. <a href="ASCII%20art%23Overprinting%20%28surprint%29">below</a>.)

In the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting. This could be produced either on a screen or on a printer by typing a character, backing up, and then typing another character, just as on a typewriter. This developed into sophisticated graphics in some cases, such as the <a href="PLATO%20%28computer%20system%29">PLATO</a> system (c. 1973), where superscript and subscript allowed a wide variety of graphic effects. A common use were for <a href="emoticon">emoticon</a>s, with WOBTAX and VICTORY both producing convincing smiley faces. Overprinting had previously been used on typewriters, but the low-resolution pixelation of characters on video terminals meant that overprinting here produced seamless pixel graphics, rather than visibly overstruck combinations of letters on paper.

Beyond pixel graphics, this was also used for printing photographs, as the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, were printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or <a href="daisy%20wheel%20printer">daisy wheel printer</a>s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in <a href="HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="Internet%20Relay%20Chat">IRC</a>, and many internet <a href="message%20board">message board</a>s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.

<a href="List%20of%20text%20editors%23ASCII%20and%20ANSI%20art">ASCII art text editors</a> are used to create ASCII art from scratch, or to edit existing ASCII art files.

ASCII art may be created from an existing digital image using an ASCII art converter, an online tool or a <a href="Computer%20program">software application</a> that automatically converts an image into ASCII art, using <a href="vector%20quantization">vector quantization</a>. Typically, this is done by sampling the image down to <a href="grayscale">grayscale</a> with less than <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> precision, so that each value corresponds to different <a href="ASCII">ASCII character</a>.

American English

American English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of <a href="language%20variety">varieties</a> of the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> native to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. 

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, considered the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" language of the country because of its widespread use. English has been given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a> for the territory.

The use of English in the United States is a result of <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">British colonization of the Americas</a>. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has developed into new dialects, in some cases under the influence of <a href="West%20African%20languages">West African</a> and <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American languages</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.

Any American or even <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian English</a> <a href="accent%20%28sociolinguistics%29">accent</a> perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called "<a href="General%20American">General American</a>", described by <a href="sociolinguist">sociolinguist</a> <a href="William%20Labov">William Labov</a> as "a fairly uniform broadcast standard in the mass media". Otherwise, however, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being a mainstream <a href="standard%20English">standard English</a> of the United States. According to Labov, with the major exception of <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern American English</a>, regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this broadcast standard. On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.

While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of "both convergence and divergence": some accents are homogenizing and <a href="accent%20levelling">levelling</a>, while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another. In 2010, <a href="William%20Labov">William Labov</a> summarized the current state of regional American accents as follows:

Some regional American English has undergone "vigorous new sound changes" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20American%20English">Mid-Atlantic</a> (centered on <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>), <a href="Western%20Pennsylvania%20English">Western Pennsylvania</a> (centered on <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>), <a href="Inland%20Northern%20American%20English">Inland Northern</a> (centered on <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, and the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a>), <a href="Midland%20American%20English">Midland</a> (centered on <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus</a>, and <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>) and <a href="Western%20American%20English">Western accents</a>, all of which "are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago." Meanwhile, the unique features of the <a href="Eastern%20New%20England%20English">Eastern New England</a> (centered on <a href="Boston">Boston</a>) and <a href="New%20York%20City%20English">New York City accents</a> appear to be stable. "On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns"; for example, the traditional accents of <a href="Charleston%2C%20SC">Charleston</a> and of <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20OH">Cincinnati</a> have given way to the general Midland accent, and of <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20MO">St. Louis</a> now approaches the sounds of an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern accent</a>, despite its huge geographic coverage, "is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the <a href="markedness">marked</a> features of Southern speech." Finally, the <a href="High%20Tider">"Hoi Toider" dialect</a> shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in North Carolina's <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> islands, yet strengthening in the islands of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>.

Below, eleven major American English accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain characteristics:

<a href="Markedness">Marked</a> New England speech is mostly associated with eastern New England, centering on Boston and Providence, and traditionally includes some notable degree of <a href="rhoticity">"r"-dropping</a> (or non-rhoticity), as well as the <a href="back%20vowel">back tongue positioning</a> of the vowel (to ) and the vowel (to ). In and north of Boston, the sound is famously centralized or even fronted. Boston shows a <a href="cot%E2%80%93caught%20merger">cot–caught merger</a>, while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.

<a href="New%20York%20City%20English">New York City English</a>, which prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> (including <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> and northeastern <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>). Its features include some notable degree of <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">non-rhoticity</a> and a locally unique <a href="%C3%A6%20tensing">short-"a" vowel pronunciation split</a>. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the vowel is fronted. The <a href="cot%E2%80%93caught%20merger">cot–caught merger</a> is markedly resisted around New York City, as depicted in popular stereotypes like "tawwk" and "cawwfee", with this vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.

Most <a href="Older%20Southern%20American%20English">older Southern speech</a> along the Eastern seaboard was non-rhotic, though, today, all local Southern dialects are strongly rhotic, defined most recognizably by the vowel losing its <a href="diphthong">gliding quality</a> and approaching , the initiating event for the Southern Vowel Shift, which includes the famous "<a href="Southern%20drawl">Southern drawl</a>" that makes short <a href="front%20vowel">front vowel</a>s into <a href="gliding%20vowel">gliding vowel</a>s.

Since the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the "<a href="Inland%20Northern%20American%20English">Inland North</a>", as defined by its local <a href="Northern%20cities%20vowel%20shift">vowel shift</a>—occurring in the same region whose "standard Midwestern" speech was the basis for <a href="General%20American">General American</a> in the mid-20th century (though prior to this recent vowel shift). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both, plus areas to the immediate west of the Great Lakes region, all collectively as "<a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">the Midwest</a>": a common but vaguely delineated term for what is now the central or north-central United States. The <a href="North%20Central%20American%20English">North Central or "Minnesotan"</a> dialect is also prevalent in the <a href="Upper%20Midwest">Upper Midwest</a>, and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like "yah" for yes, pronounced similarly to "ja" in German, Norwegian and Swedish). In parts of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, another dialect known as <a href="Pennsylvania%20Dutch%20English">Pennsylvania Dutch English</a> is also spoken.

Between the traditional American dialect areas of the "North" and "South" is what linguists have long called the "Midland". This geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower Midwest. West of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> begins the broad zone of modern-day <a href="Midland%20American%20English">Midland speech</a> . Its vocabulary has been divided into two discrete subdivisions, the "North Midland" that begins north of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> valley area, and the "South Midland" speech, which to the American ear has a slight trace of the "<a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern accent</a>" (especially due to some degree of glide weakening). The South Midland dialect follows the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> and <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> west of the <a href="Mississippi%20river">Mississippi</a>, and peters out in <a href="West%20Texas">West Texas</a>. Modern Midland speech is transitional regarding a presence or absence of the <a href="cot%E2%80%93caught%20merger">cot–caught merger</a>. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect, however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct <a href="Philadelphia%20English">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="Pittsburgh%20dialect">Pittsburgh dialect</a>s documented since the latter half of the twentieth century.

A generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse <a href="Western%20American%20English">Western American English</a> that unites the entire western half of the country. This Western dialect is mostly unified by a firm <a href="cot%E2%80%93caught%20merger">cot–caught merger</a> and a <a href="conservative%20%28linguistics%29">conservative</a>ly backed pronunciation of the long "oh" sound in "goat, toe, show", etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long "oo" sound in "goose, lose, tune," etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20English">Pacific Northwest English</a> and <a href="California%20English">California English</a>, with the <a href="Chicano%20English">Chicano English</a> accent also being a sub-type primarily of the Western accent. In the immediate <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> area, some older speakers do not have the normal Western cot–caught merger. The island state of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a <a href="creole%20language">creole language</a> known commonly as <a href="Hawaiian%20Pidgin">Hawaiian Pidgin</a>, and some native Hawaiians may even speak English with a Pidgin accent.

Although no longer region-specific, <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a>, which remains prevalent particularly among working- and middle-class <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>, has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including <a href="hip%20hop%20culture">hip hop culture</a>. The same aforementioned socioeconomic groups, but among <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic and Latino Americans</a>, have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are <a href="Chicano%20English">Chicano English</a>, spoken in the West and Midwest, and <a href="New%20York%20Latino%20English">New York Latino English</a>, spoken in the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as <a href="Yeshivish">Yeshiva English</a> and "<a href="Yinglish">Yinglish</a>" are spoken by some <a href="American%20Jews">American Jews</a>, and <a href="Cajun%20English">Cajun Vernacular English</a> by some <a href="Cajun">Cajun</a>s in southern Louisiana.

Compared with <a href="English%20language%20in%20England">English as spoken in England</a>, North American English is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as "<a href="General%20American">General American</a>." This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.

Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary <a href="British%20English">British English</a> has since lost. One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of <a href="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a>, <a href="West%20Country%20English">West Country English</a> and <a href="Scottish%20English">Scottish English</a>. In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter is a <a href="postalveolar%20approximant">postalveolar approximant</a> or <a href="retroflex%20approximant">retroflex approximant</a> rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant "r" sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.

Traditionally, the "East Coast" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">New York metropolitan area</a>, the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>. The only <a href="rhoticity%20in%20English">"r"-dropping</a> (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the East Coast, except the Mid-Atlantic region, because these areas were in close historical contact with <a href="England">England</a> and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes; in particular, the London prestige of <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">non-rhoticity</a> (or dropping the sound, except before vowels) from the 17th century onwards, which is now widespread throughout most of England. Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of <a href="New%20England%20English">eastern New England</a>, the <a href="older%20Southern%20American%20English">former plantation South</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City%20English">New York City</a>, and <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a> (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in "bird", "work", "hurt", "learn", etc. usually retains its "r" pronunciation today, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these varieties, American accents are <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">rhotic</a>, pronouncing every instance of the sound.

Many British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which <a href="General%20American%20English">General American English</a> has remained relatively more <a href="conservative%20%28linguistics%29">conservative</a>, for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a <a href="trap%E2%80%93bath%20split">trap–bath split</a>, fronting of , and <a href="H-dropping">H-dropping</a>. The innovation of <a href="T-glottalization">/t/ glottaling</a>, which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic <a href="Coronal%20consonant">coronal</a> <a href="nasal%20consonant">nasal consonant</a>, like in the words "button" or "satin") and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:



Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:

North America has given the English <a href="lexicon">lexicon</a> many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases. Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.

The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the <a href="Native%20American%20languages">Native American languages</a>. Examples of such names are "<a href="Virginia%20opossum">opossum</a>, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>, <a href="squash%20%28fruit%29">squash</a>" and "<a href="moose">moose</a>" (from <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a>). Other Native American loanwords, such as "<a href="wigwam">wigwam</a>" or "<a href="moccasin">moccasin</a>", describe articles in common use among Native Americans. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, "<a href="cookie">cookie</a>", "<a href="cruller">cruller</a>", "<a href="Urban%20stoop">stoop</a>", and "pit" (of a fruit) from <a href="Dutch%20Language">Dutch</a>; "<a href="angst">angst</a>, <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>" from <a href="German%20language">German</a>, "<a href="levee">levee</a>, portage" ("carrying of boats or goods") and (probably) "<a href="gopher%20%28animal%29">gopher</a>" from <a href="French%20language">French</a>; "<a href="barbecue">barbecue</a>, <a href="stevedore">stevedore</a>, and <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>" from <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>.

Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, "run, branch, fork, <a href="wikt%3Asnag">snag</a>, <a href="hill">bluff</a>, <a href="gulch">gulch</a>, neck" (of the woods), "barrens, <a href="bottomland">bottomland</a>, notch, knob, riffle, <a href="rapid">rapid</a>s, watergap, cutoff, <a href="trail">trail</a>, <a href="tree%20line">timberline</a>" and "<a href="water%20divide">divide</a>." Already existing words such as "<a href="stream">creek</a>, <a href="swamp">slough</a>, <a href="Ice%20pellets">sleet</a>" and (in later use) "<a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a>" received new meanings that were unknown in England.

Other noteworthy American <a href="toponym">toponym</a>s are found among loanwords; for example, "<a href="prairie">prairie</a>, <a href="butte">butte</a>" (French); "<a href="bayou">bayou</a>" (<a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> via Louisiana French); "<a href="coulee">coulee</a>" (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); "<a href="canyon">canyon</a>, <a href="mesa">mesa</a>, <a href="arroyo%20%28creek%29">arroyo</a>" (Spanish); "vlei, skate, <a href="kill%20%28body%20of%20water%29">kill</a>" (Dutch, <a href="Hudson%20Valley">Hudson Valley</a>).

The word "<a href="wikt%3Acorn">corn</a>", used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant "<a href="Zea%20mays">Zea mays</a>", the most important crop in the U.S., originally named "<a href="Indian%20corn">Indian corn</a>" by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as "<a href="grain">grain</a>". Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by "<a href="barn">barn</a>" (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and "team" (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms "<a href="rangeland">range</a>, <a href="corn%20crib">(corn) crib</a>, <a href="truck%20farm">truck</a>, <a href="grain%20elevator">elevator</a>, <a href="sharecropping">sharecropping</a>" and "<a href="feedlot">feedlot</a>."

"<a href="Ranch">Ranch</a>," later applied to a <a href="ranch%20house">house style</a>, derives from <a href="Mexican%20Spanish">Mexican Spanish</a>; most Spanish contributions came after the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, "<a href="chaps">chaps</a>" (from "chaparreras), <a href="plaza">plaza</a>, <a href="lasso">lasso</a>, <a href="bronco">bronco</a>, , <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a>;" examples of "English" additions from the <a href="cowboy">cowboy</a> era are "bad man, maverick, chuck" ("food") and "<a href="Boot%20Hill">Boot Hill</a>;" from the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> came such idioms as "hit pay dirt" or "strike it rich." The word "blizzard" probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb "belittle" and the noun "bid," both first used in writing by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>.

With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts "(land office, <a href="Land%20lot">lot</a>, outlands, waterfront," the verbs "locate" and "relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision)," types of property "(<a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>, <a href="adobe">adobe</a>" in the 18th century; "<a href="frame%20house">frame house</a>, <a href="apartment">apartment</a>, tenement house, <a href="shack">shack</a>, " in the 19th century; "project, <a href="condominium">condominium</a>, <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a>, <a href="split-level%20home">split-level</a>, <a href="mobile%20home">mobile home</a>, multi-family" in the 20th century), and parts thereof "(<a href="driveway">driveway</a>, breezeway, <a href="backyard">backyard</a>, dooryard; <a href="Clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a>, <a href="siding">siding</a>, trim, <a href="baseboard">baseboard</a>; stoop" (from Dutch), "family room, den;" and, in recent years, "<a href="HVAC">HVAC</a>, <a href="central%20air">central air</a>, walkout basement)."

Ever since the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are "run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a>, <a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a>" (after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>), "repeater", "<a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a>" (a <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> term used originally in Banking) and "<a href="pork%20barrel">pork barrel</a>." Some of these are internationally used (for example, "<a href="caucus">caucus</a>, <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>, <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>, <a href="exit%20poll">exit poll</a>)."

The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of "<a href="railroad">railroad</a>ing" (see further at <a href="rail%20terminology">rail terminology</a>) and "<a href="transport">transport</a>ation" terminology, ranging from names of roads (from "dirt roads" and "back roads" to "<a href="freeway">freeway</a>s" and "<a href="parkway">parkway</a>s)" to road infrastructure "(<a href="parking%20lot">parking lot</a>, <a href="overpass">overpass</a>, <a href="rest%20area">rest area</a>)," and from automotive terminology to "<a href="public%20transit">public transit</a>" (for example, in the sentence ""riding" the "subway downtown""); such American introductions as "commuter" (from "commutation ticket), <a href="concourse">concourse</a>, to board" (a vehicle), "to park, double-park" and "parallel park" (a car), "" or the noun "terminal" have long been used in all dialects of English.

Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations "(<a href="bartender">bartender</a>, longshoreman, patrolman, <a href="hobo">hobo</a>, <a href="bouncer%20%28doorman%29">bouncer</a>, bellhop, <a href="roustabout">roustabout</a>, <a href="White-collar%20worker">white collar</a>, <a href="blue%20collar">blue collar</a>, <a href="employee">employee</a>, boss" [from Dutch], "<a href="intern">intern</a>, <a href="busboy">busboy</a>, <a href="mortician">mortician</a>, <a href="senior%20citizen">senior citizen</a>)," businesses and workplaces "(<a href="department%20store">department store</a>, <a href="supermarket">supermarket</a>, <a href="thrift%20store">thrift store</a>, <a href="gift%20shop">gift shop</a>, <a href="Pharmacy">drugstore</a>, <a href="motel">motel</a>, <a href="main%20street">main street</a>, <a href="gas%20station">gas station</a>, <a href="hardware%20store">hardware store</a>, <a href="Savings%20and%20loan%20association">savings and loan</a>, hock" [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations "(<a href="automated%20teller%20machine">automated teller machine</a>, <a href="smart%20card">smart card</a>, <a href="cash%20register">cash register</a>, <a href="dishwasher">dishwasher</a>, reservation" [as at hotels], "pay envelope, <a href="movie">movie</a>, mileage, <a href="shortage">shortage</a>, <a href="power%20outage">outage</a>, <a href="blood%20bank">blood bank</a>)."

Already existing English words—such as "<a href="General%20store">store</a>, <a href="Retailing">shop</a>, dry goods, <a href="haberdashery">haberdashery</a>, <a href="lumber">lumber</a>"—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as "<a href="wiktionary%3AMason">mason</a>, student, <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a>", the verbs "can" (as in "canned goods"), "ship, fix, carry, enroll" (as in school), "run" (as in "run a business"), "release" and "haul"—were given new significations, while others (such as "<a href="tradesman">tradesman</a>)" have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came "<a href="break-even">break-even</a>, <a href="merger">merger</a>, , <a href="downsize">downsize</a>, <a href="disintermediation">disintermediation</a>, <a href="Net%20income">bottom line</a>;" from sports terminology came, jargon aside, "Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan" (<a href="American%20football">football</a>); "in the <a href="ballpark">ballpark</a>, out of <a href="left%20field">left field</a>, off base, hit and run," and <a href="English%20language%20idioms%20derived%20from%20baseball">many other idioms</a> from <a href="baseball">baseball</a>; gamblers coined "<a href="bluff%20%28poker%29">bluff</a>, , <a href="Betting%20%28poker%29%23Ante">ante</a>, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;" miners coined "<a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>, bonanza, peter out, pan out" and the verb "prospect" from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with "make the <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a>, sidetrack, head-on," and the verb "railroad." A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: "<a href="elevator">elevator</a>, <a href="ground%20%28electricity%29">ground</a>, <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a>;" many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not "(<a href="hatchback">hatchback</a>, <a href="sport%20utility%20vehicle">sport utility vehicle</a>, <a href="station%20wagon">station wagon</a>, <a href="trunk%20%28automobile%29%23Tailgate">tailgate</a>, <a href="motorhome">motorhome</a>, <a href="truck">truck</a>, <a href="pickup%20truck">pickup truck</a>, to exhaust)."

In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> "(<a href="chutzpah">chutzpah</a>, schmooze, tush") and <a href="German%20language">German</a>—"<a href="hamburger">hamburger</a>" and culinary terms like "frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, <a href="Hot%20dog">wiener</a>, <a href="delicatessen">deli(catessen)</a>; <a href="scram">scram</a>, <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, <a href="Responses%20to%20sneezing">gesundheit</a>;" musical terminology "(<a href="whole%20note">whole note</a>, <a href="half%20note">half note</a>," etc.); and apparently "<a href="cookbook">cookbook</a>, fresh" ("impudent") and "what gives?" Such constructions as "Are you coming with?" and "I like to dance" (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.

Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from "<a href="Okay">OK</a>" and "cool" to "<a href="nerd">nerd</a>" and "<a href="24/7">24/7</a>)," while others have not "(<a href="have%20a%20nice%20day">have a nice day</a>, for sure);" many are now distinctly old-fashioned "(swell, groovy)." Some English words now in general use, such as "hijacking, <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a>, boost, bulldoze" and "<a href="jazz">jazz</a>," originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are "get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, <a href="stiff%20upper%20lip">stiff upper lip</a>, bad hair day, <a href="monkeywrenching">throw a monkey wrench/monkeywrenching</a>, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over," and "what goes around comes around."

American English has always shown a marked tendency <a href="functional%20shift">to use nouns as verbs</a>. Examples of verbed nouns are "interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service" (as a car), "corner, torch, exit" (as in "exit the lobby"), "factor" (in mathematics), "gun" ("shoot"), "author" (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, "proposition, graft" (bribery), "bad-mouth, <a href="vacation">vacation</a>, major, <a href="backpack">backpack</a>, <a href="backtracking">backtrack</a>, intern, ticket" (traffic violations), "hassle, <a href="asphalt%20concrete">blacktop</a>, peer-review, dope" and "<a href="Drug%20overdose">OD</a>", and, of course "verbed" as used at the start of this sentence.

<a href="Compound%20%28linguistics%29">Compound</a>s coined in the U.S. are for instance "<a href="foothill">foothill</a>, <a href="flatlands">flatlands</a>, <a href="badlands">badlands</a>, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>" (in all senses), "<a href="%3Awikt%3Aoverview">overview</a>" (the noun), ", <a href="teenager">teenager</a>, <a href="brainstorming">brainstorm</a>, , <a href="hitchhike">hitchhike</a>, smalltime, , <a href="frontman">frontman</a>, lowbrow" and "highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face" (later verbed), "upfront" (in all senses), "fixer-upper, no-show;" many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: "<a href="non-profit">non-profit</a>, <a href="for-profit">for-profit</a>, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;" many compound nouns and adjectives are open: "<a href="happy%20hour">happy hour</a>, <a href="fall%20guy">fall guy</a>, <a href="capital%20gain">capital gain</a>, <a href="road%20trip">road trip</a>, wheat pit, head start, <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>;" some of these are colorful "(<a href="empty%20nester">empty nester</a>, <a href="loan%20shark">loan shark</a>, , <a href="buzz%20saw">buzz saw</a>, <a href="ghetto%20blaster">ghetto blaster</a>, dust bunny)," others are euphemistic "(<a href="differently%20abled">differently abled</a> (physically challenged), <a href="human%20resources">human resources</a>, <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a>, <a href="correctional%20facility">correctional facility</a>)."

Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ", stopover, lineup, , tryout, spin-off, <a href="rundown">rundown</a>" ("summary"), "<a href="shootout">shootout</a>, holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, <a href="Bribery">kickback</a>, <a href="makeover">makeover</a>, <a href="takeover">takeover</a>, rollback" ("decrease"), "rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up" ("stoppage"), "stand-in." These essentially are nouned <a href="phrasal%20verb">phrasal verb</a>s; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin "(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in" and "check out" (in all senses), "fill in" ("inform"), "kick in" or "throw in" ("contribute"), "square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off" (from employment), "run into" and "across" ("meet"), "stop by, pass up, put up" (money), "set up" ("frame"), "trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out)."

Noun endings such as "-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)" and "-cian (beautician)" are also particularly productive. Some verbs ending in "-ize" are of U.S. origin; for example, "fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, <a href="weatherization">weatherize</a>, winterize, <a href="Miranda%20v.%20Arizona">Mirandize</a>;" and so are some <a href="back-formation">back-formation</a>s "(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve" and "enthuse)." Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are "as of" (with dates and times), "outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to" and "lack for."

Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably "pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry" (as in "pry open", from "prize), putter" (verb), "buddy, <a href="sundae">sundae</a>, skeeter, sashay" and "kitty-corner." Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, "lengthy, bossy, <a href="cuteness">cute</a>" and "cutesy, grounded" (of a child), "punk" (in all senses), "sticky" (of the weather), "through" (as in "through train", or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as "peppy" or "wacky". American <a href="Blend%20word">blend</a>s include "<a href="motel">motel</a>, guesstimate, <a href="infomercial">infomercial</a>" and "<a href="televangelist">televangelist</a>."

A number of words and meanings that originated in <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> or <a href="Early%20Modern%20English">Early Modern English</a> and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in <a href="Scottish%20Lowlands">Lowland Scots</a>. Terms such as "<a href="autumn">fall</a>" ("autumn"), "<a href="faucet">faucet</a>" ("tap"), "<a href="diaper">diaper</a>" ("nappy"), "<a href="candy">candy</a>" ("sweets"), "<a href="Frying%20pan">skillet</a>", "<a href="eyeglasses">eyeglasses</a>" and "<a href="obligate">obligate</a>" are often regarded as Americanisms. "Fall" for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".

During the 17th century, <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">English immigration to the British colonies</a> in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term "fall" gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. "Gotten" (<a href="past%20participle">past participle</a> of "get") is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of <a href="UK">Britain</a>, such as <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use "putten" as the past participle for "put" (which is not done by most speakers of American English).

Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include "hire" ("to employ"), "quit" ("to stop", which spawned "quitter" in the U.S.), "I guess" (famously criticized by <a href="H.%20W.%20Fowler">H. W. Fowler</a>), "<a href="baggage">baggage</a>", "hit" (a place), and the adverbs "overly" and "presently" ("currently"). Some of these, for example "<a href="monkey%20wrench">monkey wrench</a>" and "<a href="wastebasket">wastebasket</a>", originated in 19th century Britain.

The mandative <a href="subjunctive%20mood">subjunctive</a> (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case "not be closed"") is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives "mad" meaning "angry", "smart" meaning "intelligent", and "sick" meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.

Linguist <a href="Bert%20Vaux">Bert Vaux</a> created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they would use in everyday speech for various concepts. This 2003 study concluded that:

American English and <a href="British%20English">British English</a> (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, "An American Dictionary of the English Language", known as <a href="Webster%27s%20Dictionary">Webster's Dictionary</a>, was written by <a href="Noah%20Webster">Noah Webster</a> in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary verb</a>s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with <a href="collective%20noun">collective noun</a>s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: "learned"/"learnt", "burned"/"burnt", "snuck/sneaked", "dove/dived") although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE "in school," BrE "at school"); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE "to the hospital", BrE "to hospital"; contrast, however, AmE "actress Elizabeth Taylor", BrE "the actress Elizabeth Taylor"). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in <a href="orthography">orthography</a> are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as "flavor" for British "flavour", "fiber" for "fibre", "defense" for "defence", "analyze" for "analyse", "license" for "licence", "catalog" for "catalogue" and "traveling" for "travelling". Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology". Other differences are due to the <a href="francophile">francophile</a> tastes of the 19th century <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> Britain (for example they preferred "programme" for "program", "manoeuvre" for "maneuver", "cheque" for "check", etc.). AmE almost always uses "-ize" in words like "realize". BrE prefers "-ise", but also uses "-ize" on occasion (see <a href="Oxford%20spelling">Oxford spelling</a>).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.

AmE sometimes favors words that are <a href="Morphology%20%28linguistics%29">morphologically</a> more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE "transportation" and BrE "transport" or where the British form is a <a href="back-formation">back-formation</a>, such as AmE "burglarize" and BrE "burgle" (from "burglar"). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differs from American English in that "schedule" can be pronounced with either [sk] or [ʃ].

Albert Spalding

Albert Goodwill Spalding (September 2, 1849 – September 9, 1915) was an American <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>, <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> and executive in the early years of professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, and the co-founder of <a href="Spalding%20%28sports%20equipment%29">A.G. Spalding</a> sporting goods company. He was born and raised in Byron, Illinois. He played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878. Spalding set a trend when he started wearing a <a href="baseball%20glove">baseball glove</a>, and eventually opened his sporting goods store.

After his retirement as a player, Spalding remained active with the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Chicago White Stockings</a> as president and part-owner. In the 1880s, he took players on the first world tour of baseball. With <a href="William%20Hulbert">William Hulbert</a>, Spalding organized the <a href="National%20League">National League</a>. He later called for the commission that investigated the origins of baseball and credited <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a> with creating the game. He also wrote the first set of official baseball rules.

Having played baseball throughout his youth, Spalding first played competitively with the <a href="Rockford%2C%20Illinois">Rockford</a> Pioneers, a youth team, which he joined in 1865. After pitching his team to a 26–2 victory over a local men's amateur team (the Mercantiles), he was approached at the age of 15 by another squad, the Forest Citys, for whom he played for two years. In the autumn of 1867 he accepted a $40 per week contract ($ in today's dollars), nominally as a clerk, but really to play professionally for the Chicago Excelsiors, not an uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time, which forbade the hiring of professional players. Following the formation of baseball's first professional organization, the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Professional%20Base%20Ball%20Players">National Association of Professional Base Ball Players</a> (which became known as the National Association, the Association, or NA) in 1871, Spalding joined the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Boston%20Braves%23Boston%20years">Boston Red Stockings</a> (precursor club to the modern <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>) and was highly successful; <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">winning</a> 206 games (and losing only 53) as a pitcher and <a href="batting%20average">batting</a> .323 as a hitter.

<a href="William%20Hulbert">William Hulbert</a>, principal owner of the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Chicago White</a> <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Stockings</a>, did not like the loose organization of the National Association and the gambling element that influenced it, so he decided to create a new organization, which he dubbed the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> of Baseball Clubs. To aid him in this venture, Hulbert enlisted the help of Spalding. Playing to the pitcher's desire to return to his Midwestern roots and challenging Spalding's integrity, Hulbert convinced Spalding to sign a contract to play for the White Stockings (now known as the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>) in 1876. Spalding then coaxed teammates <a href="Deacon%20White">Deacon White</a>, <a href="Ross%20Barnes">Ross Barnes</a> and <a href="Cal%20McVey">Cal McVey</a>, as well as <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics%20%281860%E2%80%9376%29">Philadelphia Athletics</a> players <a href="Cap%20Anson">Cap Anson</a> and <a href="Bob%20Addy">Bob Addy</a>, to sign with Chicago. This was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year. News of the signings by the Boston and Philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended and all of them faced verbal abuse and physical threats from the fans of those cities.

He was "the premier pitcher of the 1870s", leading the league in victories for each of his six full seasons as a professional. During each of those years he was his team's only pitcher. In 1876, Spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the White Stockings and led them to win the first-ever National League <a href="Pennant%20%28sports%29%23Pennants%20as%20trophies">pennant</a> by a wide margin.

In 1877, Spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand. People had used gloves previously, but they were not popular, and Spalding himself was skeptical of wearing one at first. However, once he began donning gloves, he influenced other players to do so.

Spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 at the age of 27, although he continued as president and part owner of the White Stockings and a major influence on the National League. Spalding's .796 career winning percentage (from an era when teams played about once or twice a week) is the highest ever by a baseball pitcher, far exceeding the second-best .690.

In the months after signing for Chicago, Hulbert and Spalding organized the National League by enlisting the four major teams in the East and the three other top teams in what was then considered to be the West. Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, and <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>. The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York City, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, and <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. Each signed the league's constitution, and the National League was officially born. "Spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport." Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons, it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball. Gradually, it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country.

In 1886, with Spalding as President of the franchise, the Chicago White Stockings, (today's <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>), began holding <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>, which subsequently has been called the "birthplace" of spring training baseball. The location and the training concept was the brainchild of Spalding and his player/manager <a href="Cap%20Anson">Cap Anson</a>, who saw that the city and the natural springs created positives for their players. They first played in an area called the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. Many other teams followed the concept and began training in Hot Springs and other locations.

In 1905, after <a href="Henry%20Chadwick%20%28writer%29">Henry Chadwick</a> wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the British sports of <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="rounders">rounders</a>, Spalding called for a <a href="Abraham%20G.%20Mills%23The%20Mills%20Commission">commission</a> to find out the real source of baseball. The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters. After three years of searching, on December 30, 1907, Spalding received a letter that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a>. The commission, though, was biased, as Spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the English sport of rounders. Just before the commission, in a letter to sportswriter <a href="Tim%20Murnane">Tim Murnane</a>, Spalding noted, "Our good old American game of baseball must have an American Dad." The project, later called the Mills Commission, concluded that "Base Ball had its origins in the United States" and "the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence available to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, N.Y.</a>, in 1839."

Receiving the archives of Henry Chadwick in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write "<a href="America%27s%20National%20Game">America's National Game</a>" (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the <a href="history%20of%20baseball">history of baseball</a>.

In 1874 while Spalding was playing and organizing the league, Spalding and his brother Walter began a sporting goods store in Chicago, which grew rapidly (14 stores by 1901) and expanded into a manufacturer and distributor of all kinds of sporting equipment. The company became "synonymous with sporting goods" and is still a going concern.

Spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball. In it he stated that only Spalding balls could be used (previously, the quality of the balls used had been subpar). Spalding also founded the "Baseball Guide", which at the time was the most widely read baseball publication.

In 1888–1889, Spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and <a href="Spalding%20%28sports%20equipment%29">Spalding sporting goods</a>. This was the first-ever world baseball tour. Playing across the western U.S., the tour made stops in Hawaii (although no game was played), New Zealand, Australia, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, Egypt, Italy, France, and England. The tour returned to grand receptions in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. The tour included future <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>rs Cap Anson and <a href="John%20Montgomery%20Ward">John Montgomery Ward</a>. While the players were on the tour, the National League instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players, led by Ward, who started the <a href="Players%27%20League">Players' League</a> the following season (1890). The league lasted one year, partially due to the anti-competitive tactics of Spalding to limit its success. The tour and formation of the Player's League is depicted in the 2015 movie "Deadball."

In 1900 Spalding was appointed by <a href="William%20McKinley">President McKinley</a> as the USA's Commissioner at that year's <a href="1900%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympic Games</a>.

Spalding had been a prominent member of the Theosophical Society under <a href="William%20Quan%20Judge">William Quan Judge</a>. In 1900, Spalding moved to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> with his newly acquired second wife, Elizabeth and became a prominent member and supporter of the <a href="Theosophy">Theosophical</a> community <a href="Lomaland">Lomaland</a>, which was being developed on <a href="Point%20Loma%2C%20California">Point Loma</a> by <a href="Katherine%20Tingley">Katherine Tingley</a>. He built an estate in the <a href="Sunset%20Cliffs%2C%20San%20Diego">Sunset Cliffs</a> area of Point Loma where he lived with Elizabeth for the rest of his life. The Spaldings raised race horses and collected Chinese fine furniture and art.

The Spaldings had an extensive library which included many volumes on Theosophy, art, and literature. In 1907–09 he was the driving force behind the development of a paved road, known as the "Point Loma boulevard", from downtown San Diego to Point Loma and <a href="Ocean%20Beach%2C%20San%20Diego">Ocean Beach</a>; the road also provided good access to Lomaland. It later provided the basis for <a href="California%20State%20Route%20209">California State Route 209</a>. He proposed the project, supervised it on behalf of the city, and paid a portion of the cost out of his own pocket. He joined with <a href="George%20Marston">George Marston</a> and other civic-minded businessmen to purchase the site of the original <a href="Presidio%20of%20San%20Diego">Presidio of San Diego</a>, which they developed as a historic park and eventually donated to the city of San Diego. He ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> in 1910. He helped to organize the 1915 <a href="Panama-California%20Exposition">Panama-California Exposition</a>, serving as second vice-president.

He died of a stroke on September 9, 1915 in San Diego, one week after his 66th birthday. <a href="Cremation">His ashes were scattered</a> at his request.

He was elected to the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> by the <a href="Veterans%20Committee">Veterans Committee</a> in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201939">1939</a>, as one of the first inductees from the 19th century at that summer's opening ceremonies. His plaque in the Hall of Fame reads "Albert Goodwill Spalding. Organizational genius of baseball's pioneer days. Star pitcher of Forest City Club in late 1860s, 4-year champion Bostons 1871–75 and manager-pitcher of champion Chicagos in National League's first year. Chicago president for 10 years. Organizer of baseball's first round-the-world tour in 1888."

His nephew, also named <a href="Albert%20Spalding%20%28violinist%29">Albert Spalding</a>, was a renowned <a href="violin">violin</a>ist.

Acquire

Acquire is a multi-player mergers and acquisitions themed <a href="board%20game">board game</a>. It is played with tiles representing hotels that are arranged on the board, play money and stock certificates. The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain, players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain. At the end of the game, all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money. It was one of the most popular games in the 1960s <a href="3M%20bookshelf%20game%20series">3M bookshelf game series</a>, and the only one still published in the United States.

The following components are included in all versions:


Acquire started life as the <a href="Milton%20Bradley%20Company">Milton Bradley</a> gambling-themed board game <a href="Lotto%20%28game%29">Lotto</a> played in childhood by <a href="Sid%20Sackson">Sid Sackson</a>, who went on to become a game designer. He reworked the game into a wargame he called "Lotto War". Sackson (along with <a href="Alex%20Randolph">Alex Randolph</a>) was commissioned by 3M to start a new games division in 1962. When he submitted the game to 3M in 1963, he called the game "Vacation". 3M suggested the name change to Acquire, and Sackson agreed. The game was test marketed in several U.S. cities in 1963, and production began in 1964 as a part of the <a href="3M%20bookshelf%20game%20series">bookshelf games series</a>. The 3M game division was sold to <a href="Avalon%20Hill">Avalon Hill</a> in 1976 and became part of their bookcase game series. The Avalon brand became part of Hasbro in 1998. Hasbro slightly reworked and reissued the game in 2000, but thereafter discontinued it. In the mid-2000s, the game was transferred to a Hasbro subsidiary <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>. In 2008, Wizards issued a "50th Anniversary" edition (though the game wasn't 50 years old). In 2016, the game was transferred back to the Hasbro games division and republished in Nov. 2016 under the Avalon label.

In most versions, the theme of the game is investing in <a href="hotel">hotel</a> chains. In the 1990s <a href="Hasbro">Hasbro</a> edition, the hotel chains were replaced by fictitious corporations, though the actual gameplay was unchanged. In the current Avalon edition, the companies are once again hotel chains.

The components of the game have varied over the years. In particular, the tiles have been made from wood, plastic, and cardboard in various editions of the game. In the 2008 version, the tiles were cardboard. In the 2016 version, the tiles are plastic, but the board size was reduced, from 9x12 to 10x10.

A short setup precedes play, wherein each player receives play cash and a small random set of playing tiles and becomes
the founder of a nascent hotel chain by drawing and placing a tile representing a hotel on the board. Tiles are
ordered, and correspond to spaces on the board. Position of the starting tiles determines order of play.

Play consists of placing a tile on the board and optionally buying stock. The placed tile may found a new hotel
chain, grow an existing one or merge two or more chains. Chains are sets of edge-wise adjacent tiles. Founders
receive a share of stock in new chains. A chain can become "safe", immune to acquisition, by attaining a specified
size. Following placement of a tile, the player may then buy a limited number of shares of stock in existing chains.
Shares have a market value determined by the size and stature of the hotel chain. At the end of his
turn, the player receives a new tile to replace the one played.

When mergers occur, the smaller chain becomes defunct, and its tiles are then part of the acquiring chain. The two
largest shareholders in the acquired chain receive cash bonuses; players may sell their shares in the defunct chain,
trade them in for shares of the acquiring chain, or keep them. Mergers between 3 or more chains are handled in order 
from larger to smaller.

A player during his turn may declare the game at an end if the largest chain exceeds a specified size (about 40%
of the board), or all chains on the board are too large to be acquired. When the game ends, shareholder bonuses
are paid to the two largest shareholders of each chain, and players cash out their shares at market price (shares
in any defunct chains are worthless). The player with the most money wins.

An interesting and optional aspect of gameplay is whether numbers of players' shares is public or private information.
This is negotiated before the game starts. Keeping this information private can greatly extend the game: when players
are less certain of their status, they are less willing to end the game.

Acquire is for 3 - 6 players, and is shorter than many boardgames, about an hour and a half to play.

The game was short-listed for the first <a href="Spiel%20des%20Jahres">Spiel des Jahres</a> board game awards in 1979.

"<a href="GAMES%20Magazine">GAMES</a>" magazine has inducted "Acquire" into their buyers' guide <a href="GAMES%20100%23Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>. The magazine's stated criteria for the Hall of Fame encompasses "games that have met or exceeded the highest standards of quality and play value and have been continuously in production for at least 10 years; i.e., classics."

It was inducted into the <a href="Origins%20Award">Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design's Hall of Fame</a>, along with Sackson, in 2011.

Acquire is one of the <a href="Mind%20Sports%20Olympiad">Mind Sports Olympiad</a> games.

<doc id="1897" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897" title="Australian English">
Australian English

Australian English (AuE, en-AU) is a major variety of the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>, used throughout <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Although English has no official status in the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution</a>, Australian English is the country's <a href="National%20language">national</a> and "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" <a href="official%20language">official language</a> as it is the <a href="Languages%20of%20Australia">first language of the majority of the population</a>.

Australian English began to diverge from <a href="British%20English">British English</a> after the founding of the <a href="Colony%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Colony of New South Wales</a> in 1788 and was recognised as being different from British English by 1820. It arose from the intermingling of early settlers from a great variety of <a href="Mutual%20intelligibility">mutually intelligible</a> dialectal regions of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English.

As a distinct dialect, Australian English differs considerably from other varieties of English in <a href="vocabulary">vocabulary</a>, <a href="accent%20%28sociolinguistics%29">accent</a>, <a href="pronunciation">pronunciation</a>, <a href="register%20%28sociolinguistics%29">register</a>, <a href="grammar">grammar</a> and <a href="spelling">spelling</a>.

The earliest form of Australian English was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. This first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation. The Australian-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the British Isles, in particular from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="South%20East%20England">South East England</a>.

The native-born children of the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them, and with it expressed <a href="Peer%20pressure">peer solidarity</a>. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech.

A quarter of the convicts were Irish. Many had been arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most, of the Irish spoke <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> and either no English at all, or spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking part of Britain, such as the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a>.

Records from the early 19th century show the distinct dialect that had surfaced in the colonies since <a href="First%20Fleet">first settlement</a> in 1788, with <a href="Peter%20Miller%20Cunningham">Peter Miller Cunningham</a>'s 1827 book "Two Years in New South Wales", describing the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native-born colonists, different from that of their parents and with a strong <a href="London">London</a> influence. <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> writes that "Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era."
The first of the <a href="Australian%20gold%20rushes">Australian gold rushes</a>, in the 1850s, began a large wave of <a href="Immigration%20to%20Australia">immigration</a>, during which about two per cent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. According to linguist Bruce Moore, "the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England".

Some elements of <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages">Aboriginal languages</a> have been <a href="List%20of%20English%20words%20of%20Australian%20Aboriginal%20origin">adopted by Australian English</a>—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example <a href="dingo">dingo</a>) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as "kangaroo", "boomerang", "budgerigar", "wallaby" and so on have become international. Other examples are "<a href="cooee">cooee</a>" and "hard yakka". The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced ) which travels long distances. "Cooee" is also a notional distance: "if he's within cooee, we'll spot him". "Hard yakka" means "hard work" and is derived from "yakka", from the <a href="Turrubal%20language">Jagera</a>/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.

Also of Aboriginal origin is the word "bung", from the Sydney <a href="pidgin">pidgin</a> English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning "dead", with some extension to "broken" or "useless". Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The best-known example is the capital, Canberra, named after a local language word meaning "meeting place".

Among the changes starting in the 19th century was the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from <a href="North%20American%20English">North American English</a>. The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian, such as "bushwhacker" and "squatter".
This American influence continued with the popularity of American films and the influx of American military personnel in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>; seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as "<a href="okay">okay</a>", "you guys" and "gee".

The primary way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation. It shares most similarity with other <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> accents, in particular <a href="New%20Zealand%20English">New Zealand English</a>. Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel <a href="phonology">phonology</a>.

The vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include <a href="monophthong">monophthong</a>s and <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of <a href="Received%20Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels. There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English <a href="vowel%20length">phonemic length distinction</a>, which is unusual amongst the various dialects of English, though not unknown elsewhere, such as in regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US. As with General American and New Zealand English, the <a href="weak-vowel%20merger">weak-vowel merger</a> is complete in Australian English: unstressed is merged into (<a href="schwa">schwa</a>), unless it is followed by a velar consonant.

There is little variation with respect to the sets of <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s used in various English dialects. There are, however, variations in how these consonants are used. Australian English is no exception.

Australian English is <a href="Rhoticity%20in%20English">non-rhotic</a>; in other words, the sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant. However, a <a href="Linking%20R">linking</a> can occur when a word that has a final <r> in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An <a href="Linking%20and%20intrusive%20R%23Intrusive%20R">intrusive</a> may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have <r> in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel and after word final .

There is some degree of allophonic variation in the <a href="alveolar%20stop">alveolar stop</a>s. As with North American English, <a href="Intervocalic%20alveolar%20flapping">Intervocalic alveolar flapping</a> is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic and surface as the <a href="alveolar%20tap">alveolar tap</a> after <a href="sonorant">sonorant</a>s other than , /m/as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. For many speakers, and in the combinations and -are also palatalised, thus and , as Australian is only very slightly retroflex, the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth in the same position as for ; it is also somewhat rounded ("to say 'r' the way Australians do you need to say 'w' at the same time"), where older English and have fallen together as . The <a href="wine%E2%80%93whine%20merger">wine–whine merger</a> is complete in Australian English.

<a href="English%20consonant-cluster%20reductions%23Yod-dropping">"Yod"-dropping</a> occurs after , and, . Other cases of and , along with and , have <a href="English%20consonant-cluster%20reductions%23Yod-coalescence">coalesced</a> to , , and respectively for many speakers. is generally retained in other <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s.

American Airlines Flight 77 was a scheduled <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> domestic <a href="transcontinental%20flight">transcontinental</a> <a href="Airline">passenger flight</a> from <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Washington Dulles International Airport</a> in <a href="Dulles%2C%20Virginia">Dulles, Virginia</a>, to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>. The <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757-223</a> aircraft serving the flight was <a href="Aircraft%20hijacking">hijacked</a> by five men affiliated with <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> on September 11, 2001, as part of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. They deliberately crashed the plane into <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> in <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington County, Virginia</a>, near <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.

Less than 35 minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. <a href="Hani%20Hanjour">Hani Hanjour</a>, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.

The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the <a href="Pentagon%20Memorial">Pentagon Memorial</a> adjacent to the crash site. The park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth and ranging from 1930 to 1998.

The hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 were led by <a href="Hani%20Hanjour">Hani Hanjour</a>, who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon. Hanjour first came to the United States in 1990.

Hanjour trained at the CRM Airline Training Center in <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>, earning his <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">FAA</a> <a href="Commercial%20pilot%20license">commercial pilot's certificate</a> in April 1999. He had wanted to be a commercial pilot for the <a href="Saudia">Saudi national airline</a> but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a> in 1999. Hanjour's brother later explained that, frustrated at not finding a job, Hanjour "increasingly turned his attention toward religious texts and cassette tapes of militant Islamic preachers". Hanjour returned to Saudi Arabia after being certified as a pilot, but left again in late 1999, telling his family that he was going to the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> to work for an airline. Hanjour likely went to Afghanistan, where <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> recruits were screened for special skills they might have. Already having selected the <a href="Hamburg%20cell">Hamburg cell</a> members, Al Qaeda leaders selected Hanjour to lead the fourth team of hijackers.

<a href="Alec%20Station">Alec Station</a>, the CIA's unit dedicated to tracking Osama bin Laden, had discovered that two of the other hijackers, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, had multiple-entry visas to the United States well before 9/11. Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters, but CIA officers rebuffed them.

In December 2000, Hanjour arrived in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, joining "muscle" hijackers <a href="Nawaf%20al-Hazmi">Nawaf al-Hazmi</a> and <a href="Khalid%20al-Mihdhar">Khalid al-Mihdhar</a>, who had been there since January 2000. Soon after arriving, Hanjour and Hazmi left for <a href="Mesa%2C%20Arizona">Mesa, Arizona</a>, where Hanjour began refresher training at Arizona Aviation.

In April 2001, they relocated to <a href="Falls%20Church%2C%20Virginia">Falls Church, Virginia</a>, where they awaited the arrival of the remaining "muscle" hijackers. One of these men, <a href="Majed%20Moqed">Majed Moqed</a>, arrived on May 2, 2001, with Flight 175 hijacker <a href="Ahmed%20al-Ghamdi">Ahmed al-Ghamdi</a> from <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> at <a href="Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles International Airport</a>. They moved into an apartment with Hazmi and Hanjour.

On May 21, 2001, Hanjour rented a room in <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a>, where he stayed with other hijackers through the end of August. The last Flight 77 "muscle" hijacker, <a href="Salem%20al-Hazmi">Salem al-Hazmi</a>, arrived on June 29, 2001, with <a href="Abdulaziz%20al-Omari">Abdulaziz al-Omari</a> (a hijacker of Flight 11) at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> from the United Arab Emirates. They stayed with Hanjour.

Hanjour received ground instruction and did practice flights at Air Fleet Training Systems in <a href="Teterboro%2C%20New%20Jersey">Teterboro, New Jersey</a>, and at Caldwell Flight Academy in <a href="Fairfield%20Township%2C%20Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fairfield, New Jersey</a>. Hanjour moved out of the room in Paterson and arrived at the Valencia Motel in <a href="Laurel%2C%20Maryland">Laurel, Maryland</a>, on September 2, 2001. While in Maryland, Hanjour and fellow hijackers trained at <a href="Gold%27s%20Gym">Gold's Gym</a> in <a href="Greenbelt%2C%20Maryland">Greenbelt</a>. On September 10, he completed a certification flight, using a terrain recognition system for navigation, at Congressional Air Charters in <a href="Gaithersburg%2C%20Maryland">Gaithersburg, Maryland</a>.

On September 10, Nawaf al-Hazmi—accompanied by other hijackers—checked into the <a href="Marriott%20International">Marriott</a> in <a href="Herndon%2C%20Virginia">Herndon, Virginia</a>, near Dulles Airport.

According to a U.S. State Department cable leaked in the WikiLeaks dump in February 2010, the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori. He had associated with three <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>i citizens who flew from Los Angeles to London (via Washington) and Qatar on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> and the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the data about the four men was "just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges". An official added that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. <a href="Eleanor%20Hill">Eleanor Hill</a>, the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways.

The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on September 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day. Instead, they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar, via Washington and London. While the cable said that Mansoori was currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials said that there was no active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.

The American Airlines Flight 77 aircraft was a <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757-223</a> (<a href="Aircraft%20registration">registration</a> The aircraft was built and had its first flight in 1991. The flight crew included pilot <a href="Charles%20Burlingame">Charles Burlingame</a> (a <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">Naval Academy</a> graduate and former <a href="fighter%20pilot">fighter pilot</a>), First Officer David Charlebois, and flight attendants Michele Heidenberger, Jennifer Lewis, Kenneth Lewis, and Renee May. The capacity of the aircraft was 188 passengers, but with 58 passengers on September 11, the <a href="Load%20factor%20%28transportation%29">load factor</a> was 33 percent. American Airlines said that Tuesdays were the least-traveled day of the week, with the same load factor seen on Tuesdays in the previous three months for Flight 77.

On the morning of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Washington Dulles International Airport</a>. At 07:15, <a href="Khalid%20al-Mihdhar">Khalid al-Mihdhar</a> and <a href="Majed%20Moqed">Majed Moqed</a> checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, arriving at the passenger security checkpoint a few minutes later at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a <a href="hand%20wand">hand wand</a>. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. <a href="Hani%20Hanjour">Hani Hanjour</a> checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by <a href="Salem%20al-Hazmi">Salem</a> and <a href="Nawaf%20al-Hazmi">Nawaf al-Hazmi</a>, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. <a href="Utility%20knife">Utility knives</a> up to four inches were permitted at the time by the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) as carry-on items. The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by <a href="Argenbright%20Security">Argenbright Security</a>, under contract with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>.

The hijackers were all selected for extra screening of their checked bags. Hanjour, al-Mihdhar, and Moqed were chosen by the <a href="Computer%20Assisted%20Passenger%20Prescreening%20System">Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System</a> criteria, while the brothers Nawaf and Salem al-Hazmi were selected because they did not provide adequate identification and were deemed suspicious by the airline check-in agent. Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Nawaf al-Hazmi did not check any bags for the flight. Checked bags belonging to Moqed and Salem al-Hazmi were held until they boarded the aircraft.

Flight 77 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 08:10; 58 passengers boarded through Gate D26, including the five hijackers. Excluding the hijackers, of the 59 other passengers and crew on board, there were 26 men, 22 women, and five children ranging in age from three to eleven. On the flight, Hani Hanjour was seated up front in 1B, while Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi were seated in first class in seats 5E and 5F. Majed Moqed and Khalid al-Mihdhar were seated further back in 12A and 12B, in economy class. Flight 77 left the gate on time and took off from Runway 30 at Dulles at 08:20.

The <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a> estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a> struck the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> and not too long after <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20175">United Airlines Flight 175</a> had been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> occurred at 08:50:51. Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat and the pilots were not immediately killed but shoved to the back of the plane with the rest of the passengers. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south. Two minutes later at 08:56, the plane's transponder was switched off. The hijackers set the flight's <a href="autopilot">autopilot</a> on a course heading east towards Washington, D.C.

The FAA was aware at this point that there was an emergency on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was within minutes of striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the airplane was hijacked, it was flying over <a href="United%20States%20National%20Radio%20Quiet%20Zone">an area of limited radar coverage</a>. With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.

Two people on the aircraft made phone calls to contacts on the ground. At 09:12, flight attendant Renee May called her mother, Nancy May, in Las Vegas. During the call, which lasted nearly two minutes, May said her flight was being hijacked by six persons, and staff and passengers had been moved to the rear of the airplane. May asked her mother to contact American Airlines, which she and her husband promptly did; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking. Between 09:16 and 09:26, passenger <a href="Barbara%20Olson">Barbara Olson</a> called her husband, <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">United States Solicitor General</a> <a href="Theodore%20Olson">Theodore Olson</a>, and reported that the airplane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives. She reported that the passengers, including the pilots, had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call. A minute into the conversation, the call was cut off. Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice, and tried unsuccessfully to contact <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a>. About five minutes later, Barbara Olson called again, told her husband that the "pilot" (possibly Hanjour on the cabin intercom) had announced the flight was hijacked, and asked, "What do I tell the pilot to do?" Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying low over a residential area. He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Soon afterward, the call cut off again.

An airplane was detected again by Dulles controllers on radar screens as it approached Washington, turning and descending rapidly. Controllers initially thought this was a military fighter, due to its high speed and maneuvering. Reagan Airport controllers asked a passing <a href="Air%20National%20Guard">Air National Guard</a> <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a> to identify and follow the aircraft. The pilot, Lt. Col. <a href="Steven%20O%27Brien%20%28pilot%29">Steven O'Brien</a>, told them it was a Boeing 757 or 767, and its silver fuselage meant that it was probably an American Airlines jet. He had difficulty picking out the airplane in the "East Coast haze", but then saw a "huge" fireball, and initially assumed it had hit the ground. Approaching the Pentagon, he saw the impact site on the building's west side and reported to Reagan control, "Looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon, sir."

According to the 9/11 Commission Report, as Flight 77 was west-southwest of the Pentagon, it made a 330-degree turn. At the end of the turn, it was descending through , pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington. Hani Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dived toward the Pentagon. While level above the ground and seconds from the crash, the wings knocked over five street lampposts and the right wing struck a portable <a href="electric%20generator">generator</a>, creating a smoke trail seconds before smashing into the Pentagon. Flight 77, flying at 530 mph (853 km/h, 237 m/s, or 460 knots) over the Navy Annex Building adjacent to <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, crashed into the western side of <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> in <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington County, Virginia</a>, just south of Washington, D.C., at 09:37:46. The plane hit the Pentagon at the first-floor level, and at the moment of impact, the airplane was rolled slightly to the left, with the right wing elevated. The front part of the <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> disintegrated on impact, while the mid and tail sections moved for another fraction of a second, with tail section debris penetrating furthest into the building. In all, the airplane took eight-tenths of a second to fully penetrate into the three outermost of the building's five rings and unleashed a fireball that rose above the building.

At the time of the attacks, approximately 18,000 people worked in the Pentagon, which was 4,000 fewer than before renovations began in 1998. The section of the Pentagon that was struck, which <a href="Pentagon%20Renovation%20Program">had recently been renovated</a> at a cost of $250 million, housed the Naval Command Center.

In all, there were 189 deaths at the Pentagon site, including the 125 in the Pentagon building in addition to the 64 on board the aircraft. Passenger <a href="Barbara%20Olson">Barbara Olson</a> was en route to a recording of the TV show "<a href="Politically%20Incorrect">Politically Incorrect</a>". A group of children, their chaperones, and <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a> staff members were also on board, embarking on an educational trip west to the <a href="Channel%20Islands%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary</a> near <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara, California</a>. The fatalities at the Pentagon included 55 <a href="military%20personnel">military personnel</a> and 70 <a href="civilian">civilian</a>s. Of those 125 killed, 92 were on the first floor, 31 were on the second floor, and two were on the third. Seven <a href="Defense%20Intelligence%20Agency">Defense Intelligence Agency</a> civilian employees were killed while the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Office of the Secretary of Defense</a> lost one contractor. The <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> suffered 75 fatalities—53 civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers—while the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> suffered 42 fatalities—nine civilians (six employees and three contractors) and 33 sailors. Lieutenant General <a href="Timothy%20Maude">Timothy Maude</a>, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military officer killed at the Pentagon; also killed was retired <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Wilson%20Flagg">Wilson Flagg</a>, a passenger on the plane. LT <a href="Mari-Rae%20Sopper">Mari-Rae Sopper</a>, JAGC, USNR, was also on board the flight, and was the first <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps%2C%20U.S.%20Navy">Navy Judge Advocate</a> ever to be killed in action. Another 106 were injured on the ground and were treated at area hospitals.

On the side where the plane hit, the Pentagon is bordered by <a href="Interstate%20395%20%28District%20of%20Columbia-Virginia%29">Interstate 395</a> and Washington Boulevard. Motorist Mary Lyman, who was on I-395, saw the airplane pass over at a "steep angle toward the ground and going fast" and then saw the cloud of smoke from the Pentagon. Omar Campo, another witness, was cutting the grass on the other side of the road when the airplane flew over his head, and later recalled:

Afework Hagos, a computer programmer, was on his way to work and stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the airplane flew over. "There was a huge screaming noise and I got out of the car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in." Daryl Donley witnessed the crash and took some of the first photographs of the site.

"<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" reporter Mike Walter was driving on Washington Boulevard when he witnessed the crash, which he recounted,

Terrance Kean, who lived in a nearby apartment building, heard the noise of loud jet engines, glanced out his window, and saw a "very, very large passenger jet". He watched "it just plow right into the side of the Pentagon. The nose penetrated into the portico. And then it sort of disappeared, and there was fire and smoke everywhere." Tim Timmerman, who is a pilot himself, noticed American Airlines markings on the aircraft as he saw it hit the Pentagon. Other drivers on Washington Boulevard, <a href="Interstate%20395%20%28District%20of%20Columbia-Virginia%29">Interstate 395</a>, and <a href="Columbia%20Pike%20%28Virginia%29">Columbia Pike</a> witnessed the crash, as did people in <a href="Pentagon%20City%2C%20Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Pentagon City</a>, <a href="Crystal%20City%2C%20Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Crystal City</a>, and other nearby locations.

Former <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas%20men%27s%20basketball">Georgetown University</a> basketball coach <a href="John%20Thompson%20%28basketball%29">John Thompson</a> had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As he would tell the story many times in the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on <a href="Jim%20Rome">Jim Rome</a>'s <a href="The%20Jim%20Rome%20Show">radio show</a>, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel on the day of the show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.

Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The <a href="Arlington%20County%20Fire%20Department">Arlington County Fire Department</a> (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10 minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an <a href="incident%20command%20system">incident command system</a> (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from <a href="Fort%20Myer">Fort Myer</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Washington%20National%20Airport">Reagan National Airport</a> arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.

As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires, they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse. One firefighter remarked that they "pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking". Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation. Minutes later, at 10:10, the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed. The collapsed area was about at its widest point and at its deepest. The amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed. After the collapse, the interior fires intensified, spreading through all five floors. After 11:00, firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires. Officials estimated temperatures of up to . While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread. Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it. Firefighters instead made <a href="firebreak">firebreak</a>s in the roof on September 12 to prevent further spreading. At 18:00 on the 12th, Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was "controlled" but not fully "extinguished". Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days.

Various pieces of aircraft debris were found within the wreckage at the Pentagon. While on fire and escaping from the Navy Command Center, Lt. Kevin Shaeffer observed a chunk of the aircraft's <a href="nose%20cone">nose cone</a> and the <a href="Undercarriage%20arrangements%23Boeing">nose landing gear</a> in the service road between rings B and C. Early in the morning on Friday, September 14, Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team members Carlton Burkhammer and Brian Moravitz came across an "intact seat from the plane's cockpit", while paramedics and firefighters located the two <a href="Flight%20recorder">black boxes</a> near the punch out hole in the A-E drive, nearly into the building. The <a href="cockpit%20voice%20recorder">cockpit voice recorder</a> was to retrieve any information, though the flight data recorder yielded useful information. Investigators also found a part of Nawaf al-Hazmi's <a href="Identity%20documents%20in%20the%20United%20States">driver's license</a> in the North Parking Lot rubble pile. Personal effects belonging to victims were found and taken to Fort Myer.

Army engineers determined by 5:30 p.m. on the first day that no one remained alive in the damaged section of the building. In the days after the crash, news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died. Army troops from <a href="Fort%20Belvoir">Fort Belvoir</a> were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains. <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) <a href="FEMA%20Urban%20Search%20and%20Rescue%20Task%20Force">Urban Search and Rescue</a> teams, including <a href="Urban%20Search%20and%20Rescue%20Virginia%20Task%20Force%201">Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue</a> assisted the search for remains, working through the National Interagency Incident Management System (NIIMS). Kevin Rimrodt, a Navy photographer surveying the Navy Command Center after the attacks, remarked that "there were so many bodies, I'd almost step on them. So I'd have to really take care to look backwards as I'm backing up in the dark, looking with a flashlight, making sure I'm not stepping on somebody". Debris from the Pentagon was taken to the Pentagon's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence.

Remains that were recovered from the Pentagon were photographed, and turned over to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner office, located at <a href="Dover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Dover Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. The medical examiner's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims. Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack. The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, and were turned over as evidence to the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI). On September 21, the ACFD relinquished control of the crime scene to the FBI. The Washington Field Office, National Capital Response Squad (NCRS), and the <a href="Joint%20Terrorism%20Task%20Force">Joint Terrorism Task Force</a> (JTTF) led the <a href="crime%20scene">crime scene</a> investigation at the Pentagon.

By October 2, 2001, the search for evidence and remains was complete and the site was turned over to Pentagon officials. In 2002, the remains of 25 victims were buried collectively at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, with a five-sided granite marker inscribed with the names of all the victims in the Pentagon. The ceremony also honored the five victims whose remains were never found.

At around 3:40 a.m. on September 14, a paramedic and a firefighter who were searching through the debris of the impact site found two dark boxes, about by long. They called for an FBI agent, who in turn called for someone from the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB). The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the <a href="flight%20recorder">flight recorders ("black boxes")</a> from American Airlines Flight 77. Dick Bridges, deputy manager for Arlington County, Virginia, said the <a href="cockpit%20voice%20recorder">cockpit voice recorder</a> was damaged on the outside and the <a href="flight%20data%20recorder">flight data recorder</a> was charred. Bridges said the recorders were found "right where the plane came into the building."

The cockpit voice recorder was transported to the NTSB lab in Washington, D.C., to see what data was salvageable. In its report, the NTSB identified the unit as an L-3 Communications, Fairchild Aviation Recorders model A-100A cockpit voice recorder—a device which records on <a href="magnetic%20tape">magnetic tape</a>. No usable segments of tape were found inside the recorder; according to the NTSB's report, "[t]he majority of the recording tape was fused into a solid block of charred plastic". On the other hand, all the data from the flight data recorder, which used a <a href="solid-state%20drive">solid-state drive</a>, was recovered.

At the moment of impact, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and assisted the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to <a href="Site%20R">Site R</a>, a backup facility in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary <a href="Paul%20Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a> to Site R. The <a href="National%20Military%20Command%20Center">National Military Command Center</a> (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.

During a press conference held inside the Pentagon at 18:42, Rumsfeld announced, "The Pentagon's functioning. It will be in business tomorrow." Pentagon employees returned the next day to offices in mostly unaffected areas of the building. By the end of September, more workers returned to the lightly damaged areas of the Pentagon.

Early estimates on rebuilding the damaged section of the Pentagon were that it would take three years to complete. However, the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact. An <a href="Pentagon%20Memorial">outdoor memorial</a>, commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman, was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11, 2008. Since September 11, <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> continues to fly from <a href="Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles International Airport</a> to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a>. As of August 2016, flight number 77 has been renumbered to 2636, now using a <a href="Boeing%20737-800">Boeing 737-800</a>, departing at 7:40 in the morning.

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> released filmed footage on May 16, 2006, that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a "thin white blur" and an explosion following. The images were made public in response to a December 2004 <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a> request by <a href="Judicial%20Watch">Judicial Watch</a>. Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the edited video of the crash.

A nearby <a href="Citgo">Citgo</a> service station also had security cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 did not show the crash because the camera was pointed away from the crash site.

The <a href="Doubletree">Doubletree</a> Hotel, located nearby in Crystal City, Virginia, also had a security camera video. The FBI released the video on December 4, 2006, in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed by Scott Bingham. The footage is "grainy and the focus is soft, but a rapidly growing tower of smoke is visible in the distance on the upper edge of the frame as the plane crashes into the building".

On September 12, 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General <a href="Richard%20Myers">Richard Myers</a>, Chairman of the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, dedicated the <a href="Victims%20of%20Terrorist%20Attack%20on%20the%20Pentagon%20Memorial">Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon Memorial</a> at Arlington National Cemetery. The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found. This included Dana Falkenberg, age three, who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister. A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site. The memorial is a pentagonal <a href="granite">granite</a> marker high. On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words "Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11, 2001". <a href="Aluminum">Aluminum</a> plaques, painted black, are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack. The site is located in Section 64, on a slight rise, which gives it a view of the Pentagon.

At the <a href="National%20September%2011%20Memorial">National September 11 Memorial</a>, the names of the Pentagon victims are inscribed on the South Pool, on Panels S-1 and S-72 – S-76.

The <a href="Pentagon%20Memorial">Pentagon Memorial</a>, located just southwest of The Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, is a permanent outdoor memorial to the 184 people who died as victims in the building and on American Airlines Flight 77 during the September 11 attacks.

Ambush

An ambush is a long-established <a href="military%20tactics">military tactic</a> in which <a href="combatant">combatant</a>s take advantage of concealment and the <a href="element%20of%20surprise">element of surprise</a> to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense <a href="underbrush">underbrush</a> or behind <a href="hill">hill</a>tops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from <a href="ancient%20warfare">ancient</a> to <a href="modern%20warfare">modern warfare</a>. In the 20th century, an ambush might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a>, or a small <a href="Irregular%20military">irregular</a> band or <a href="insurgent">insurgent</a> group attacking a <a href="Regular%20army">regular</a> armed force patrol.

The use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game. 

One example from ancient times is the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Trebia">Battle of the Trebia</a> river. <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> encamped within striking distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says Polybius, a "place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy". When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans. Nevertheless, the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force. Although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 Romans cut their way through to safety, maintaining <a href="unit%20cohesion">unit cohesion</a>. This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a <a href="kill%20zone">kill zone</a> is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. (See Ranger reference below).

Another famous ambush was that sprung by Germanic warchief <a href="Arminius">Arminius</a> against the Romans at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a>. This particular ambush was to affect the course of Western history. The Germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush. They took cover in difficult forested terrain, allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection. They had the element of surprise, and this was also aided by the defection of Arminius from Roman ranks prior to the battle. They sprang the attack when the Romans were most vulnerable; when they had left their fortified camp, and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm. 

The Germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly, using a massive series of short, rapid, vicious charges against the length of the whole Roman line, with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place. The Germans also used blocking obstacles, erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder Roman movement along the route of the killing zone. The result was mass slaughter of the Romans, and the destruction of three legions. The Germanic victory caused a limit on Roman expansion in the West. Ultimately, it established the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Roman influence in the West. The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine.

According to Muslim tradition, Islamic Prophet <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> used ambush tactics in his military campaigns. His first such use was during the <a href="Caravan%20raids">Caravan raids</a>, in the Kharrar caravan raid Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the <a href="Quraysh%20tribe">Quraysh</a>. His group consisted of about twenty Muhajirs. This raid was done about a month after the previous. Sa'd, with his soldiers, set up an ambush in the valley of <a href="Kharrar">Kharrar</a> on the road to Mecca and waited to raid a returning Meccan caravan from Syria. But the caravan had already passed and the Muslims returned to Medina without any loot.

Arab tribes during Muhammad's era also used ambush tactics. One example retold in Muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the <a href="First%20Raid%20on%20Banu%20Thalabah">First Raid on Banu Thalabah</a>. The Banu Thalabah tribe were already aware of the impending attack; so they lay in wait for the Muslims, and when Muhammad ibn Maslama arrived at the site.The Banu Thalabah, with 100 men ambushed them, while the Muslims were making preparation to sleep; and after a brief resistance killed all of Muhammad ibn Maslama’s men. Muhammad ibn Maslama pretended to be dead. A Muslim who happened to pass that way found him and assisted him to return to <a href="Medina">Medina</a>. The raid was unsuccessful.

In modern warfare, an ambush is most often employed by ground troops up to <a href="platoon">platoon</a> size against enemy targets, which may be other ground troops, or possibly vehicles. However, in some situations, especially when deep behind enemy lines, the actual attack will be carried out by a platoon, a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>-sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group, setting up and maintaining a forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy, and to which they will retire after the attack.

Ambushes are complex, multi-phase operations, and are, therefore, usually planned in some detail. First, a suitable killing zone is identified. This is the place where the ambush will be laid. It is generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass, and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment, execution, and extraction phases of the ambush patrol. A path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example.

Ambush can be described geometrically as:
Ambush criteria: The terrain for the ambush had to meet strict criteria:

One important feature of the ambush was that the target units should 'pile up' after being attacked, thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the <a href="kill%20zone">kill zone</a> and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fires. Terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy. The terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force, or which offered some protection to the target, was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre-registered for mortars.

Ambush units: The NVA/VC ambush formations consisted of:

Other elements might also be included if the situation demanded, such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcement.

Command posts: When deploying into an ambush site, the NVA first occupied several observation posts, placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using, its strength and firepower, as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander. Usually one main OP and several secondary OP's were established. Runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the OP's and the main command post. The OP's were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options. Frequently the OP's were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security. The command post was situated in a central location, often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site.

Recon methods: Recon elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300–500 meters away. Sometimes a "leapfrogging" recon technique was used. Surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other. As the enemy drew close to the first, it fell back behind the last recon team, leaving an advance group in its place. This one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap, and the cycle rotated. This method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points, and allowed the recon groups to cover one another.

<doc id="1908" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1908" title="Abzyme">
Abzyme

An abzyme (from <a href="antibody">antibody</a> and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>), also called "catmab" (from "catalytic monoclonal antibody"), and most often called "catalytic antibody", is a <a href="monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibody</a> with <a href="catalytic%20activity">catalytic activity</a>. Abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptens, but some natural abzymes can be found in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with <a href="autoimmune%20diseases">autoimmune diseases</a> such as <a href="systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, where they can bind to and hydrolyze <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. To date abzymes display only weak, modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical use. They are, however, subjects of considerable academic interest. Studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms, enzyme structure and function, catalysis, and the immune system itself.

Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state of a chemical reaction, thereby enabling the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between the reactant(s) and the product(s). If an antibody is developed to bind to a molecule that's structurally and electronically similar to the transition state of a given chemical reaction, the developed antibody will bind to, and stabilize, the transition state, just like a natural enzyme, lowering the activation energy of the reaction, and thus catalyzing the reaction. By raising an antibody to bind to a stable transition-state analog, a new and unique type of enzyme is produced.

So far, all catalytic antibodies produced have displayed only modest, weak catalytic activity. The reasons for low catalytic activity for these molecules have been widely discussed. Possibilities indicate that factors beyond the binding site may play an important, in particular through protein dynamics. Some abzymes have been engineered to use metal ions and other <a href="cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactor</a>s to improve their catalytic activity.

The possibility of catalyzing a reaction by means of an antibody which binds the transition state was first suggested by <a href="William%20Jencks">William P. Jencks</a> in 1969. In 1994, <a href="Peter%20G.%20Schultz">Peter G. Schultz</a> and <a href="Richard%20A.%20Lerner">Richard A. Lerner</a> received the prestigious <a href="Wolf%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Wolf Prize in Chemistry</a> for developing catalytic antibodies for many reactions and popularizing their study into a significant sub-field of enzymology.

In a June 2008 issue of the journal Autoimmunity Review, researchers S Planque, Sudhir Paul, Ph.D, and Yasuhiro Nishiyama, Ph.D of the University Of Texas Medical School at Houston announced that they have engineered an abzyme that degrades the superantigenic region of the <a href="gp120">gp120</a> <a href="CD4">CD4</a> binding site. This is the one part of the <a href="HIV">HIV</a> <a href="virus">virus</a> outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to <a href="T%20lymphocytes">T lymphocytes</a>, the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat. The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this protein gp120 is necessary for HIV to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population.

The abzyme does more than bind to the site, it catalytically destroys the site, rendering the virus inert, and then can attack other HIV viruses. A single abzyme molecule can destroy thousands of HIV viruses.

<doc id="1909" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1909" title="Adaptive radiation">
Adaptive radiation

In <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biology</a>, adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms, particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available, creates new challenges, or opens new environmental niches. Starting with a recent single ancestor, this process results in the <a href="speciation">speciation</a> and phenotypic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits. An example of adaptive radiation would be the avian species of the Hawaiian honeycreepers. Via natural selection, these birds adapted rapidly and converged based on the different environments of the Hawaiian islands.

Much research has been done on adaptive radiation due to its dramatic effects on the diversity of a population. However, more research is needed, especially to fully understand the many factors affecting adaptive radiation. Both empirical and theoretical approaches are helpful, though each has its disadvantages. In order to procure the largest amount of data, empirical and theoretical approaches must be united.

Four features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation:

The evolution of a novel feature may permit a clade to diversify by making new areas of morphospace accessible. A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth. This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on. Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s available to mammals. The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>, and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation. Birds find other ways to provide for each other, i.e. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore, initiating an adaptive radiation.
Other examples include <a href="placental">placental</a> gestation (for <a href="eutheria">eutheria</a>n mammals), or <a href="Bipedalism">bipedal locomotion</a> (in <a href="hominins">hominins</a>).

One famous example where adaptive radiation is seen is with <a href="Darwin%27s%20finches">Darwin's finches</a>. It has been observed by many evolutionary biologists that fragmented landscapes are often a prime location for adaptive radiation to occur. The differences in geography throughout disjointed landscapes such as islands are believed to promote such diversification. Darwin's finches occupy the fragmented landscape of the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> and are diversified into many different species which differ in ecology, song, and morphology, specifically the size and shapes of their <a href="beak">beak</a>s. The first obvious explanation for these differences is <a href="allopatric%20speciation">allopatric speciation</a>, speciation that occurs when populations of the same species become isolated geographically and evolve separately. Because the finches are divided amongst the islands, the birds have been evolving separately for several million years. However, this does not account for the fact that many of the species occur in <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a>, with seven or more species inhabiting the same island. This raises the question as to why these species split when living in the same environment with all the same resources. Petren, Grant, Grant, and Keller proposed that the speciation of the finches occurred in two parts: an initial, easily observable allopatric event followed by a less clear sympatric event. This sympatric event which occurred second was adaptive radiation. This occurred largely to promote specialization upon each island. One major morphological difference among species sharing one island is beak size and shape. Adaptive radiation led to the evolution of different beaks which could access different food and resources. Those with short beaks are better adapted to eating seeds on the ground, those with thin, sharp beaks eat insects, and those with long beaks use their beaks to probe for food inside cacti. With these specializations, seven or more species of finches are able to inhabit the same environments without competition or lack of resources killing several off. In other words, these morphological differences in beak size and shape brought about by adaptive radiation allow the island diversification to persist.

Another famous example is the <a href="cichlid">cichlid</a> fishes in lakes of the <a href="East%20African%20Rift">East African Rift</a>. The lakes in this area are believed to support and sustain about 2,000 different species of these fish, each with different ecological and morphological characteristics such as body size. Like the Galápagos Islands, these lakes form a fragmented landscape that isolates the cichlid fish from one another, allowing them, and many of the organisms they live with, to evolve separately. The diversity of the lakes is in fact quite extraordinary because the adaptive radiations here are sometimes so young. One thing that has interested scientists about the cichlid fish case is the possibility of convergent evolution, or the evolution of analogous structures independently, driven by similar environmental selection pressures. However, quantitative studies on the convergent evolution of the cichlid fish are limited.

Another example of an adaptive radiation would be an <a href="endemic">endemic</a> species of the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>. The <a href="Hawaiian%20honeycreeper">Hawaiian honeycreeper</a>s are a large, highly diverse species which have been part of a vast adaptive radiation, that began as the Hawaiian Islands started to form. The honeycreeper species was shaped by island formation and natural selection. The mechanism by which this adaptive radiation occurred can be described as allopatric speciation via the peripheral isolate model. Each time a new island formed, a dispersal event would occur which would result in new community structures on each island. New selection pressures forced the adaptive radiation of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, as they needed to exploit new resources from the different environments of each island. It has been determined that many of the similar morphologies and behaviors of the Hawaiian Honeycreepers, located on distant islands, are due to convergence of analogous traits caused by similar environments.

Though the most famously recognized cases of adaptive radiation have occurred in animals such as Darwin's finches or the cichlid fish, adaptive radiation certainly occurs in plant species as well. The most famous example of adaptive radiation in plants is quite possibly the Hawaiian <a href="Argyroxiphium">silverswords</a>. The Hawaiian <a href="silversword%20alliance">silversword alliance</a> consists of twenty-eight species of Hawaiian plants which range from trees to shrubs to vines. This is exceptional diversification as can be seen through the significant morphological differences between each species of the Hawaiian silverswords. With some species, it is virtually impossible to distinguish visually that they were ever part of one species to begin with. These radiations occurred millions of years ago, but through studies over the past few decades, it has been suggested that the rate of speciation and diversification was extremely high. These high rates, as well as the fragmented landscape of the Hawaiian Islands, are key characteristics which point directly to adaptive radiation.

<a href="Anolis">Anolis</a> lizards have been radiating widely in many different environments, including Central and South America, as well as the West Indies and experience great diversity of species just as the finches, cichlid fish, and silverswords. Studies have been done to determine whether radiations occur similarly for these lizards on the mainland as they do on the <a href="Caribbean%20islands">Caribbean islands</a> or if differences can be observed in how they speciated. It has been observed that in fact, the radiations are very different, and ecological and morphological characteristics that these lizards developed as part of their speciation on the islands and on the mainland are unique. They have clearly evolved differently to the environments they inhabit. The environmental pressures on the Anolis lizards are not the same on the mainland as they are on the islands. There are significantly more <a href="predation">predators</a> preying on the Anolis lizards on the mainland. This is but one environmental difference. Other factors play a role in what sort of adaptive radiation will develop. Among the Caribbean islands, a larger perch diameter correlates with longer forelimbs, larger body mass, longer tails, and longer hind limbs. However, on the mainland, a larger perch diameter correlates with shorter tails. This shows that these lizards adapted differently to their environment depending on whether they were located on the mainland or the islands. These differing characteristics reconfirm that most of the adaptive radiation between the mainland and the islands occurred independently. On the islands specifically, species have adapted to certain "microhabitats" in which they require different morphological traits to survive. Irschick (1997) divides these microhabitats into six groups: "trunk–ground, trunk–crown, grass–bush, crown–giant, twig, and trunk." Different groups of lizards would acquire traits for one of these particular areas that made them more specialized for survival in this microhabitat and not so much in others. Adaptive radiation allows species to acquire the traits they need to survive in these microhabitats and reduce competition to allow the survival of a greater number of organisms as seen in many of the examples before.

<doc id="1910" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1910" title="Agarose gel electrophoresis">
Agarose gel electrophoresis

Agarose gel electrophoresis is a method of <a href="gel%20electrophoresis">gel electrophoresis</a> used in <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, and <a href="clinical%20chemistry">clinical chemistry</a> to separate a mixed population of macromolecules such as DNA or proteins in a matrix of <a href="agarose">agarose</a>, one of the two main components of <a href="agar">agar</a>. The proteins may be separated by charge and/or size (<a href="isoelectric%20focusing">isoelectric focusing</a> agarose electrophoresis is essentially size independent), and the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="RNA">RNA</a> fragments by length. Biomolecules are separated by applying an <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a> to move the charged molecules through an agarose matrix, and the biomolecules are separated by size in the agarose gel matrix.

Agarose gel is easy to cast, has relatively fewer charged groups, and is particularly suitable for separating DNA of size range most often encountered in laboratories, which accounts for the popularity of its use. The separated DNA may be viewed with stain, most commonly under UV light, and the DNA fragments can be extracted from the gel with relative ease. Most agarose gels used are between 0.7 - 2% dissolved in a suitable electrophoresis buffer.

<a href="Agarose">Agarose</a> gel is a three-dimensional matrix formed of helical agarose molecules in supercoiled bundles that are aggregated into three-dimensional structures with channels and pores through which biomolecules can pass. The 3-D structure is held together with hydrogen bonds and can therefore be disrupted by heating back to a liquid state. The melting temperature is different from the gelling temperature, depending on the sources, agarose gel has a gelling temperature of 35-42 °C and a melting temperature of 85-95 °C. Low-melting and low-gelling agaroses made through chemical modifications are also available.

Agarose gel has large pore size and good gel strength, making it suitable as an anticonvection medium for the electrophoresis of DNA and large protein molecules. The pore size of a 1% gel has been estimated from 100 nm to 200-500 nm, and its gel strength allows gels as dilute as 0.15% to form a slab for gel electrophoresis. Low-concentration gels (0.1 - 0.2%) however are fragile and therefore hard to handle. Agarose gel has lower resolving power than polyacrylamide gel for DNA but has a greater range of separation, and is therefore used for DNA fragments of usually 50-20,000 bp in size. The limit of resolution for standard agarose gel electrophoresis is around 750 kb, but resolution of over 6 Mb is possible with <a href="pulsed%20field%20gel%20electrophoresis">pulsed field gel electrophoresis</a> (PFGE). It can also be used to separate large proteins, and it is the preferred matrix for the gel electrophoresis of particles with effective radii larger than 5-10 nm. A 0.9% agarose gel has pores large enough for the entry of <a href="bacteriophage%20T4">bacteriophage T4</a>.

The agarose polymer contains charged groups, in particular <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a> and <a href="sulphate">sulphate</a>. These negatively charged groups create a flow of water in the opposite direction to the movement of DNA in a process called <a href="electroendosmosis">electroendosmosis</a> (EEO), and can therefore retard the movement of DNA and cause blurring of bands. Higher concentration gel would have higher electroosmotic flow. Low EEO agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose <a href="gel%20electrophoresis%20of%20nucleic%20acids">gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids</a>, but high EEO agarose may be used for other purposes. The lower sulphate content of low EEO agarose, particularly low-melting point (LMP) agarose, is also beneficial in cases where the DNA extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures, such as <a href="ligation%20%28molecular%20biology%29">ligation</a> and <a href="Polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR</a>. Zero EEO agaroses however are undesirable for some applications as they may be made by adding positively charged groups and such groups can affect subsequent enzyme reactions. Electroendosmosis is a reason agarose is used in preference to <a href="agar">agar</a> as the <a href="agaropectin">agaropectin</a> component in agar contains a significant amount of negatively charged sulphate and carboxyl groups. The removal of agaropectin in agarose substantially reduce the EEO, as well as reducing the non-specific adsorption of biomolecules to the gel matrix. However, for some applications such as the electrophoresis of serum proteins, a high EEO may be desirable, and agaropeptin may be added in the gel used.

A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores (gel concentration), size of DNA being electrophoresed, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration of intercalating dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis.

Smaller molecules travel faster than larger molecules in gel, and double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is inversely proportional to the log of the number of base pairs. This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments, and separation of very large DNA fragments requires the use of <a href="pulsed%20field%20gel%20electrophoresis">pulsed field gel electrophoresis</a> (PFGE).

For standard agarose gel electrophoresis, larger molecules are resolved better using a low concentration gel while smaller molecules separate better at high concentration gel. High concentrations gel however requires longer run times (sometimes days).

The movement of the DNA may be affected by the <a href="Chemical%20structure">conformation</a> of the DNA molecule, for example, <a href="DNA%20supercoil">supercoiled DNA</a> usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact. In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present. Gel electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show the negatively supercoiled form as the main band, while nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form appears as minor bands. The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions, and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel.

Ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence in gel during electrophoresis can affect its movement. Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.

DNA damage due to increased <a href="cross-link">cross-link</a>ing will also reduce electrophoretic DNA migration in a dose-dependent way.

The rate of migration of the DNA is proportional to the voltage applied, i.e. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves. The resolution of large DNA fragments however is lower at high voltage. The mobility of DNA may also change in an unsteady field - in a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency. This phenomenon can result in band inversion in field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE), whereby larger DNA fragments move faster than smaller ones.


The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis. The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, and a number of models exist to explain the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix. A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a <a href="random%20coil">random coil</a> DNA moves through the interconnected pores, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.

The Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a <a href="reptation">reptation</a> model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a "snake-like" fashion (hence "reptation") through the pores as an elongated molecule. A biased reptation model applies at higher electric field strength, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction and pulls the rest of the molecule along. Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules, however, showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres.

The details of an agarose gel electrophoresis experiment may vary depending on methods, but most follow a general procedure.
The gel is prepared by dissolving the agarose powder in an appropriate buffer, such as TAE or TBE, to be used in electrophoresis. The agarose is dispersed in the buffer before heating it to near-boiling point, but avoid boiling. The melted agarose is allowed to cool sufficiently before pouring the solution into a cast as the cast may warp or crack if the agarose solution is too hot. A comb is placed in the cast to create wells for loading sample, and the gel should be completely set before use.

The concentration of gel affects the resolution of DNA separation. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.8% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments. 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis. The concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used (g/ml). High percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly, while low percentage gels (0.1-0.2%) are fragile and not easy to handle. Low-melting-point (LMP) agarose gels are also more fragile than normal agarose gel. Low-melting point agarose may be used on its own or simultaneously with standard agarose for the separation and isolation of DNA. PFGE and FIGE are often done with high percentage agarose gels.

Once the gel has set, the comb is removed, leaving wells where DNA samples can be loaded. Loading buffer is mixed with the DNA sample before the mixture is loaded into the wells. The loading buffer contains a dense compound, which may be glycerol, sucrose, or <a href="Ficoll">Ficoll</a>, that raises the density of the sample so that the DNA sample may sink to the bottom of the well. If the DNA sample contains residual ethanol after its preparation, it may float out of the well. The loading buffer also include colored dyes such as <a href="xylene%20cyanol">xylene cyanol</a> and <a href="bromophenol%20blue">bromophenol blue</a> used to monitor the progress of the electrophoresis. The DNA samples are loaded using a <a href="pipette">pipette</a>.

Agarose gel electrophoresis is most commonly done horizontally in a submarine mode whereby the slab gel is completely submerged in buffer during electrophoresis. It is also possible, but less common, to perform the electrophoresis vertically, as well as horizontally with the gel raised on agarose legs using an appropriate apparatus. The buffer used in the gel is the same as the running buffer in the electrophoresis tank, which is why electrophoresis in the submarine mode is possible with agarose gel.

For optimal resolution of DNA greater than 2kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis, 5 to 8 V/cm is recommended (the distance in cm refers to the distance between electrodes, therefore this recommended voltage would be 5 to 8 multiplied by the distance between the electrodes in cm). Voltage may also be limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if it is run at high voltage for a prolonged period, especially if the gel used is LMP agarose gel. Too high a voltage may also reduce resolution, as well as causing band streaking for large DNA molecules. Too low a voltage may lead to broadening of band for small DNA fragments due to dispersion and diffusion.

Since DNA is not visible in natural light, the progress of the electrophoresis is monitored using colored dyes. Xylene cyanol (light blue color) comigrates large DNA fragments, while Bromophenol blue (dark blue) comigrates with the smaller fragments. Less commonly used dyes include <a href="Cresol%20Red">Cresol Red</a> and <a href="Orange%20G">Orange G</a> which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue. A <a href="Molecular%20weight%20size%20marker">DNA marker</a> is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. Note however that the size of a circular DNA like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by <a href="restriction%20digest">restriction digest</a>, alternatively a supercoiled DNA marker may be used.

DNA as well as RNA are normally visualized by staining with <a href="ethidium%20bromide">ethidium bromide</a>, which intercalates into the major grooves of the DNA and fluoresces under UV light. The ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels, or the DNA gel may be stained later after electrophoresis. Destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images. Other methods of staining are available; examples are <a href="SYBR%20Green%20I">SYBR Green</a>, <a href="GelRed">GelRed</a>, <a href="methylene%20blue">methylene blue</a>, <a href="brilliant%20cresyl%20blue">brilliant cresyl blue</a>, <a href="Nile%20blue">Nile blue</a> sulphate, and <a href="crystal%20violet">crystal violet</a>. SYBR Green, GelRed and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it has been shown to be <a href="mutagenic">mutagenic</a> in <a href="Ames%20test">Ames test</a>, although the <a href="carcinogenicity">carcinogenicity</a> of ethidium bromide has not actually been established. SYBR Green requires the use of a blue-light transilluminator. DNA stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a UV transilluminator which is an advantage, however it may not produce a strong band.

When stained with ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV) transilluminator. Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of <a href="Transformation%20efficiency">transformation</a>, "in vitro" <a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a>, and <a href="Polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR</a>. Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365 nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.

The transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices, such as a digital or polaroid camera, that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed.
The separated DNA bands are often used for further procedures, and a DNA band may be cut out of the gel as a slice, dissolved and purified. Contaminants however may affect some downstream procedures such as PCR, and low melting point agarose may be preferred in some cases as it contains fewer of the sulphates that can affect some enzymatic reactions. The gels may also be used for blotting techniques.

In general, the ideal buffer should have good conductivity, produce less heat and have a long life. There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis; common ones for nucleic acids include <a href="TAE%20buffer">Tris/Acetate/EDTA</a> (TAE) and <a href="TBE%20buffer">Tris/Borate/EDTA</a> (TBE). Many other buffers have been proposed, e.g. <a href="LB%20buffer">lithium borate</a> (LB), which is almost never used, based on Pubmed citations, iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Tris-phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if DNA extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction. Borate is problematic; Borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity but provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM lithium borate). The buffers used contain EDTA to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function.


Agarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis. Samples are also easily recovered. After the experiment is finished, the resulting gel can be stored in a plastic bag in a refrigerator.

Electrophoresis is performed in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.

Allele

An allele (/əˈliːl/) is a variant form of a given <a href="gene">gene</a>. Sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable <a href="phenotypic%20trait">phenotypic trait</a>s, such as different <a href="pigmentation">pigmentation</a>. A good example of this trait of color variation is the work Gregor Mendel did with the white and purple flower colors in pea plants; discovering that each color was the result of a “pure line” trait which could be used as a control for future experiments. However, most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation.

The word "allele" is a short form of allelomorph ("other form", a word coined by <a href="William%20Bateson">William Bateson</a>), which was used in the early days of <a href="genetics">genetics</a> to describe variant forms of a <a href="gene">gene</a> detected as different <a href="phenotypes">phenotypes</a>. It derives from the Greek prefix "ἀλλήλ", "allel", meaning "reciprocal" or "each other", which itself is related to the Greek adjective ἄλλος (allos; cognate with Latin "alius"), meaning "other".

Most <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s have two sets of <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s; that is, they are <a href="diploid">diploid</a>. These chromosomes are referred to as <a href="homologous%20chromosome">homologous chromosome</a>s. If both alleles at a gene (or <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a>) on the homologous chromosomes are the same, they and the organism are <a href="homozygous">homozygous</a> with respect to that gene (or locus). If the alleles are different, they and the organism are <a href="heterozygous">heterozygous</a> with respect to that gene.

In many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as leading to <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> or <a href="recessive">recessive</a>, according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the <a href="heterozygote">heterozygote</a> most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele expressed is the one that leads to the dominant phenotype. The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci. This type of interaction was first formally described by <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>. However, many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by <a href="co-dominance">co-dominance</a> and <a href="Quantitative%20trait%20locus">polygenic inheritance</a>.

The term "<a href="wild%20type">wild type</a>" allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in "wild" populations of organisms, such as fruit flies ("<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>"). Such a "wild type" allele was historically regarded as leading to adominant (overpowering - always expressed), common, and normal phenotype, in contrast to "<a href="mutant">mutant</a>" alleles that lead to recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious phenotypes. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the "wild type" allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative "mutant" allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of "affected" individuals, often as <a href="genetic%20diseases">genetic diseases</a>, and more frequently in heterozygous form in "<a href="Genetic%20carrier">carriers</a>" for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.

A population or <a href="species">species</a> of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles (<a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphism</a>) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population. A <a href="null%20allele">null allele</a> is a gene variant that lacks the gene's normal function because it either is not expressed, or the expressed protein is inactive.

For example, at the gene locus for the <a href="ABO">ABO</a> <a href="blood%20type">blood type</a> <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s in humans, classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I, I, and i, that determine compatibility of <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a>s. Any individual has one of six possible <a href="genotype">genotype</a>s (II, Ii, II, Ii, II, and ii) that produce one of four possible <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s: "Type A" (produced by II homozygous and Ii heterozygous genotypes), "Type B" (produced by II homozygous and Ii heterozygous genotypes), "Type AB" produced by II heterozygous genotype, and "Type O" produced by ii homozygous genotype. (It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus. Hence an individual with "Type A" blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different "A" alleles.)

The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see <a href="Hardy-Weinberg%20principle">Hardy-Weinberg principle</a>). For a simple model, with two alleles:

where "p" is the frequency of one allele and "q" is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, "p" is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2"pq" is the fraction of heterozygotes, and "q" is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is "p" + 2"pq", and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is "q".

With three alleles:

In the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:

A number of <a href="genetic%20disorders">genetic disorders</a> are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include <a href="albinism">albinism</a>, <a href="cystic%20fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, <a href="galactosemia">galactosemia</a>, <a href="phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU), and <a href="Tay%E2%80%93Sachs%20disease">Tay–Sachs disease</a>. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are <a href="hemizygosity">hemizygous</a>), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green <a href="color%20blindness">color blindness</a> and <a href="fragile%20X%20syndrome">fragile X syndrome</a>.

Other disorders, such as <a href="Huntington%20disease">Huntington disease</a>, occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele.

While <a href="heredity">heritable traits</a> are typically studied in terms of genetic alleles, <a href="epigenetic">epigenetic</a> marks such as <a href="DNA%20methylation">DNA methylation</a> can be inherited at specific genomic regions in certain species, a process termed <a href="transgenerational%20epigenetic%20inheritance">transgenerational epigenetic inheritance</a>. The term "epiallele" is used to distinguish these heritable marks from traditional alleles, which are defined by <a href="nucleotide%20sequence">nucleotide sequence</a>. A specific class of epiallele, the <a href="metastable%20epiallele">metastable epiallele</a>s, has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by stochastic (probabilistic) establishment of epigenetic state that can be mitotically inherited.

Ampicillin

Ampicillin is an <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> used to prevent and treat a number of <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial infection</a>s, such as <a href="respiratory%20tract%20infection">respiratory tract infection</a>s, <a href="urinary%20tract%20infections">urinary tract infections</a>, <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, <a href="salmonellosis">salmonellosis</a>, and <a href="endocarditis">endocarditis</a>. It may also be used to prevent <a href="group%20B%20streptococcal%20infection">group B streptococcal infection</a> in newborns. It is used by mouth, by <a href="intramuscular%20injection">injection into a muscle</a>, or intravenously. Like all antibiotics, it is not useful for the treatment of viral infections.
Common side effects include rash, nausea, and diarrhea. It should not be used in people who are <a href="allergic%20to%20penicillin">allergic to penicillin</a>. Serious side effects may include <a href="Clostridium%20difficile%20colitis">"Clostridium difficile" colitis</a> or <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>. While usable in those with <a href="kidney%20problem">kidney problem</a>s, the dose may need to be decreased. Its use during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> and <a href="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> appears to be generally safe.
Ampicillin was discovered in 1958 and came into commercial use in 1961. It is on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%27s%20List%20of%20Essential%20Medicines">World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines</a>, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a <a href="health%20system">health system</a>. Its wholesale cost in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a> is between US$0.13 and 1.20 for a vial of the intravenous solution as of 2014. In the United States, it is available as a <a href="generic%20medication">generic medication</a> and 10 days of treatment cost about $13.

Ampicillin is used to treat infections by many <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive</a> and <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative bacteria</a>. Ampicillin was the first 'broad spectrum' penicillin with activity against Gram-positive bacteria including "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>", "<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">Streptococcus pyogenes</a>", some isolates of "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" (but not penicillin-resistant or methicillin-resistant strains), and some "<a href="Enterococcus">Enterococcus</a>". Activity against Gram-negative bacteria includes "<a href="Neisseria%20meningitidis">Neisseria meningitidis</a>", some "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>", and some of the <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">Enterobacteriaceae</a>. Its spectrum of activity is enhanced by co-administration of <a href="sulbactam">sulbactam</a>, a drug that inhibits <a href="beta%20lactamase">beta lactamase</a>, an enzyme produced by bacteria to inactivate ampicillin and related antibiotics. It is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics that have different mechanisms of action, like <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, <a href="linezolid">linezolid</a>, <a href="daptomycin">daptomycin</a>, and <a href="tigecycline">tigecycline</a>.

Ampicillin can be administered by <a href="oral%20administration">mouth</a>, an <a href="intramuscular%20injection">intramuscular injection</a> (shot) or by <a href="intravenous%20infusion">intravenous infusion</a>.


Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics. In very rare cases, it causes severe side effects such as <a href="angioedema">angioedema</a>, <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>, and "C. difficile" infection. Some develop <a href="Black%20hairy%20tongue">black 'furry' tongue'</a>. The most serious adverse effects are <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s, <a href="serum%20sickness">serum sickness</a>, <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>, <a href="pseudomembranous%20colitis">pseudomembranous colitis</a>. The most common side effects to be expected in ten percent of users are <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> and <a href="rash">rash</a>. Less common side effects can be <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, <a href="itching">itching</a>, blood <a href="dyscrasia%23Modern%20use">dyscrasia</a>s, and mild <a href="allergic%20reactions">allergic reactions</a>. Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment.

Ampicillin reacts with <a href="probenecid">probenecid</a> to decrease <a href="renal%20excretion">renal excretion</a>. Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of <a href="warfarin">warfarin</a>. Ampicillin use can make <a href="oral%20contraceptives">oral contraceptives</a> less effective.

Ampicillin is in the <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> group of <a href="%CE%B2-Lactam%20antibiotic">beta-lactam antibiotic</a>s and is part of the <a href="aminopenicillin">aminopenicillin</a> family. It is roughly equivalent to <a href="amoxicillin">amoxicillin</a> in terms of activity.

Ampicillin is able to penetrate Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. It differs from <a href="Benzylpenicillin">penicillin G</a>, or benzylpenicillin, only by the presence of an <a href="amino">amino</a> group. That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

Ampicillin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme <a href="DD-transpeptidase">transpeptidase</a>, which is needed by bacteria to make the cell wall. It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in <a href="binary%20fission">binary fission</a>, which ultimately leads to cell <a href="lysis">lysis</a>; therefore, ampicillin is usually bacteriolytic.

Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961. Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company <a href="Beecham%20%28pharmaceutical%20company%29">Beecham</a>, penicillin therapies had only been effective against Gram-positive organisms such as <a href="Staphylococcus">staphylococci</a> and <a href="Streptococcus">streptococci</a>. Ampicillin (originally branded as 'Penbritin') also demonstrated activity against Gram-negative organisms such as "H. influenzae", <a href="coliform">coliform</a>s, and "<a href="Proteus%20%28bacterium%29">Proteus</a>" spp.

Its wholesale costs is between US$0.13 and 1.20 for a vial of the intravenous solution as of 2014. In the United States, it is available as a <a href="generic%20medication">generic medication</a> and 10 days of treatment cost about $13.

Antimicrobial resistance

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the ability of a microbe to resist the effects of medication previously used to treat them. This broader term also covers antibiotic resistance, which applies to <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. Resistance arises through one of three ways: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic <a href="mutation">mutation</a>, or by one species acquiring resistance from another. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations; or more commonly following gradual buildup over time, and because of <a href="antibiotic%20misuse">misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials</a>. Resistant microbes are increasingly difficult to treat, requiring alternative medications or higher doses, both of which may be more expensive or <a href="adverse%20effect">more toxic</a>. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called <a href="multiple%20drug%20resistance">multidrug resistant</a> (MDR); or sometimes superbugs. Antimicrobial resistance is on the rise with millions of deaths every year. All classes of microbes develop resistance: fungi develop <a href="antifungal">antifungal</a> resistance, <a href="virus">virus</a>es develop <a href="antiviral">antiviral</a> resistance, <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> develop <a href="antiprotozoal">antiprotozoal</a> resistance, and <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> develop <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> resistance.
Antibiotics should only be used when needed as prescribed by health professionals. The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics are preferred over broad-spectrum antibiotics when possible, as effectively and accurately targeting specific organisms is less likely to cause resistance. Cultures should be taken before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report. For people who take these medications at home, education about proper use is essential. Health care providers can minimize spread of resistant infections by use of proper <a href="sanitation">sanitation</a> and <a href="hygiene">hygiene</a>, including <a href="handwashing">handwashing</a> and disinfecting between patients, and should encourage the same of the patient, visitors, and family members.
Rising drug resistance is caused mainly by improper use of antimicrobials in humans as well as in animals, and spread of resistant strains between the two. Antibiotics increase <a href="selective%20pressure">selective pressure</a> in bacterial populations, causing vulnerable bacteria to die; this increases the percentage of resistant bacteria which continue growing. With resistance to antibiotics becoming more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug development is becoming rarer.
A <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) report released April 2014 stated, "this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance—when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections—is now a major threat to public health." Increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat include proposals for <a href="international%20treaty">international treaties</a> on antimicrobial resistance. Worldwide antibiotic resistance is not fully mapped, but poorer countries with weak healthcare systems are more affected. According to the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>: "Each year in the United States, at least 2 million people become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections." There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including <a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (MRSA), <a href="Vancomycin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">vancomycin-resistant "S. aureus"</a> (VRSA), <a href="Beta-lactamase">extended spectrum beta-lactamase</a> (ESBL), <a href="Vancomycin-resistant%20Enterococcus">vancomycin-resistant "Enterococcus"</a> (VRE), <a href="Acinetobacter%20baumannii">multidrug-resistant "A. baumannii"</a> (MRAB).

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.
A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe.

Bacteria with resistance to antibiotics predate medical use of antibiotics by humans; however, widespread antibiotic use has made more bacteria resistant through the process of <a href="evolutionary%20pressure">evolutionary pressure</a>.

Reasons for the widespread use of antibiotics include:

<a href="Antibiotic%20use%20in%20livestock">Antibiotic use in livestock</a> feed at low doses for growth promotion is an accepted practice in many industrialized countries and is known to lead to increased levels of resistance. Releasing large quantities of antibiotics into the environment during pharmaceutical manufacturing through inadequate <a href="wastewater%20treatment">wastewater treatment</a> increases the risk that antibiotic-resistant strains will develop and spread. It is uncertain whether antibacterials in soaps and other products contribute to antibiotic resistance, but they are discouraged for other reasons.

Increasing bacterial resistance is linked with the volume of antibiotic prescribed, as well as missing doses when taking antibiotics. Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics has been attributed to a number of causes, including people insisting on antibiotics, physicians prescribing them as they feel they do not have time to explain why they are not necessary, and physicians not knowing when to prescribe antibiotics or being overly cautious for medical and/or legal reasons.

Up to half of antibiotics used in humans are unnecessary and inappropriate. For example, a third of people believe that antibiotics are effective for the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a>, and the common cold is the most common reason antibiotics are prescribed even though antibiotics are useless against viruses. A single regimen of antibiotics even in compliant individuals leads to a greater risk of resistant organisms to that antibiotic in the person for a month to possibly a year.

Antibiotic resistance increases with duration of treatment; therefore, as long as an effective minimum is kept, shorter courses of antibiotics are likely to decrease rates of resistance, reduce cost, and have better outcomes with fewer complications. Short course regimens exist for <a href="community-acquired%20pneumonia">community-acquired pneumonia</a> <a href="spontaneous%20bacterial%20peritonitis">spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</a>, suspected lung infections in intense care wards, so-called <a href="acute%20abdomen">acute abdomen</a>, middle ear infections, sinusitis and throat infections, and penetrating gut injuries. In some situations a short course may not cure the infection as well as a long course. A <a href="BMJ">BMJ</a> editorial recommended that antibiotics can often be safely stopped 72 hours after symptoms resolve. Because individuals may feel better before the infection is eradicated, doctors must provide instructions to them so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription. Some researchers advocate doctors' using a very short course of antibiotics, reevaluating the patient after a few days, and stopping treatment if there are no clinical signs of infection.

Certain <a href="antibiotic%20classes">antibiotic classes</a> result in resistance more than others. Increased rates of MRSA infections are seen when using <a href="Glycopeptide%20antibiotic">glycopeptides</a>, <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s, and <a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolone antibiotic</a>s. Cephalosporins, and particularly quinolones and <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>, are more likely to produce colonisation with <a href="Clostridium%20difficile%20%28bacteria%29">"Clostridium difficile"</a>.

Factors within the intensive care unit setting such as mechanical ventilation and multiple underlying diseases also appear to contribute to bacterial resistance. Poor hand <a href="hygiene">hygiene</a> by hospital staff has been associated with the spread of resistant organisms, and an increase in hand washing compliance results in decreased rates.

Improper use of antibiotics can often be attributed to the presence of <a href="structural%20violence">structural violence</a> in particular regions. Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy. The efficacy of treatment programs for drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence.

The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> concluded that inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an underlying contributor to the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant germs, and that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be restricted. The <a href="World%20Organisation%20for%20Animal%20Health">World Organisation for Animal Health</a> has added to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs, monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry, and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances. Another guideline is to implement methodologies that help to establish associated risk factors and assess the risk of antibiotic resistance.

Eighty percent of antibiotics sold in the United States are used on livestock. The majority of these antibiotics are given to animals that are otherwise healthy. Rather, it is normal practice to mix antibiotics with livestock food to promote healthier living conditions and to encourage animal growth. The use of antibiotics in animals is to a large degree involved in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Antibiotics are used in food with the intention of not only preventing, controlling, and treating diseases, but also to promote growth. Antibiotic use in animals can be classified into therapeutic, prophylactic, metaphylactic, and growth promotion uses of antibiotics. All four patterns select for bacterial resistance, since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process, but the non-therapeutic uses expose larger number of animals, and therefore of bacteria, for more extended periods, and at lower doses. They therefore greatly increase the cross-section for the evolution of resistance.

In 2001, the <a href="Union%20of%20Concerned%20Scientists">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs, and cattle), in the absence of disease. The amounts given are termed "sub-therapeutic", i.e., insufficient to combat disease. Despite no diagnosis of disease, the administration of these drugs (most of which are not significant to human medicine) results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated. It is theorized that sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant. Studies have shown, however, that, in essence, the overall population levels of bacteria are unchanged; only the mix of bacteria is affected. The actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promoters is thus unclear. Some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub-clinical infections, which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive. No convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory, and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives. The mechanism of growth promotion is therefore probably something other than "killing off the bad bugs".

Antibiotics are used in U.S. animal feed to promote animal productivity. In particular, poultry feed and <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> is a common route of administration of drugs, because of higher overall costs when drugs are administered by handling animals individually.

In research studies, occasional animal-to-human spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms has been demonstrated. Resistant bacteria can be transmitted from animals to humans in three ways: by consuming <a href="animal%20product">animal product</a>s (milk, meat, eggs, etc.), from close or direct contact with animals or other humans, or through the environment. In the first pathway, <a href="food%20preservation">food preservation</a> methods can help eliminate, decrease, or prevent the growth of bacteria in some food classes. Evidence for the transfer of macrolide-resistant microorganisms from animals to humans has been scant, and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there, with rare cases of transference to humans.

Naturally occurring antibiotic resistance is common. Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like antibiotics themselves, are ancient. The genes that confer resistance are known as the environmental <a href="resistome">resistome</a>. These genes may be transferred from non-disease-causing bacteria to those that do cause disease, leading to clinically significant antibiotic resistance. In 1952 it was shown that penicillin-resistant bacteria existed before penicillin treatment; and also preexistent bacterial resistance to <a href="streptomycin">streptomycin</a>. In 1962, the presence of <a href="penicillinase">penicillinase</a> was detected in dormant <a href="endospore">endospore</a>s of "<a href="Bacillus%20licheniformis">Bacillus licheniformis</a>", revived from dried soil on the roots of plants, preserved since 1689 in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. Six <a href="Strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a> of "<a href="Clostridium">Clostridium</a>", found in the bowels of William Braine and John Hartnell (members of the <a href="Franklin%20Expedition">Franklin Expedition</a>) showed resistance to <a href="cefoxitin">cefoxitin</a> and <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>. Penicillinase may have emerged as a defense mechanism for bacteria in their <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, such as the case of penicillinase-rich "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>", living with penicillin-producing "<a href="Trichophyton">Trichophyton</a>"; however, this may be circumstantial. Search for a penicillinase ancestor has focused on the class of <a href="protein">protein</a>s that must be "a priori" capable of specific combination with <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>. The resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin in turn was attributed to Braine's and Hartnell's contact with microorganisms that naturally produce them or <a href="random%20mutation">random mutation</a> in the <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s of "Clostridium" strains. There is evidence that <a href="heavy%20metals">heavy metals</a> and other pollutants may select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, generating a constant source of them in small numbers.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments. In this respect, the spread and contamination of the environment, especially through "hot spots" such as hospital <a href="wastewater">wastewater</a> and untreated urban wastewater, is a growing and serious public health problem. Antibiotics have been polluting the environment since their introduction through <a href="human%20waste">human waste</a> (medication, farming), animals, and the pharmaceutical industry. Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment.

As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure. Antibiotic resistance is widespread in marine vertebrates, and they may be important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the marine environment.

<a href="Antibiotic%20stewardship%20programme">Antibiotic stewardship programme</a>s appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.

In 2014, the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">WHO</a> stated:

Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have. For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance. Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases. Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.

The <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> has the lowest rate of antibiotic prescribing in the <a href="OECD">OECD</a>, at a rate of 11.4 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 people per day in 2011. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> also have lower prescribing rates, with Sweden's rate having been declining since 2007. By contrast, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> have high prescribing rates of more than 28 DDD. It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.

About a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in <a href="Patient%23Outpatients%20and%20inpatients">outpatient settings</a> in the United States were not appropriate in 2010 and 2011. Doctors in the U.S. wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 people, with 353 being medically necessary.

ResistanceOpen, an online global map of antimicrobial resistance developed by <a href="HealthMap">HealthMap</a>, displays aggregated data on antimicrobial resistance from publicly available and user submitted data. The website can display data for a 25-mile radius from a location. Users may submit data from <a href="antibiogram">antibiogram</a>s for individual hospitals or laboratories. European data is from the EARS-Net (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network), part of the <a href="European%20Centre%20for%20Disease%20Prevention%20and%20Control">ECDC</a>. ResistanceMap, by the <a href="Center%20for%20Disease%20Dynamics%2C%20Economics%20%26amp%3B%20Policy">Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy</a>, also provides data on antimicrobial resistance on a global level.

Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease. Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics. These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

In a recent years, <a href="antimicrobial%20stewardship">antimicrobial stewardship</a> teams in hospitals have encouraged optimal use of antimicrobials. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while not increasing the risk of death.

Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

On March 27, 2015, the White House released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed "The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria" with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:

The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.

According to the report, issued in January 2016, the five important strategies needed for minimising antibiotic resistance are as follows:

Microorganisms do not develop resistance to <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increase, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs. However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may <a href="Evolution">evolve</a>; for example, an updated <a href="influenza%20vaccine">influenza vaccine</a> is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between "Staphylococcus" species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.

Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.

Since the discovery of antibiotics, <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> (R&D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options. Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection. Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis can cause deafness or psychological disability. The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&D. Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation. The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of <a href="drug%20development">development</a> than for other pharmaceuticals. In 2011, <a href="Pfizer">Pfizer</a>, one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses. However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> have been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms. On 12 December 2013, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a>. The ADAPT Act aims to fast-track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, the FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.

On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the <a href="President%27s%20Council%20of%20Advisors%20on%20Science%20and%20Technology">President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology</a> (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics. Among the proposals:
The executive order also included a $20 million prize to encourage the development of diagnostic tests to identify highly resistant bacterial infections.

The U.S. <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> plans to fund a new research network on the issue up to $62 million from 2013 to 2019. Using authority created by the <a href="Pandemic%20and%20All%20Hazards%20Preparedness%20Act">Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act</a> of 2006, the <a href="Biomedical%20Advanced%20Research%20and%20Development%20Authority">Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority</a> in the U.S. <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">Department of Health and Human Services</a> announced that it will spend between $40 million and $200 million in funding for R&D on new antibiotic drugs under development by <a href="GlaxoSmithKline">GlaxoSmithKline</a>.

One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial <a href="ABC%20transporters">ABC transporters</a>, which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell. ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens.

<a href="Bacteriophage">Bacteriophage</a>s are used against antibiotic resistant bacteria in <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> (<a href="George%20Eliava%20Institute">George Eliava Institute</a>) and in 1 institute in <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, Poland.

In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban <a href="avoparcin">avoparcin</a> and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999. In 2006 a ban on the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective. In Scandinavia, there is evidence that the ban has led to a lower <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of antibiotic resistance in (nonhazardous) animal bacterial populations. As of 2004, several European countries established a decline of antimicrobial resistance in humans through limiting the usage antimicrobials in agriculture and food industries without jeopardizing animal health or economic cost.

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) and the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of <a href="fluoroquinolone">fluoroquinolone</a> use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant "<a href="Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a>" infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006. Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

During 2007, two federal bills (S. 549 and H.R. 962) aimed at phasing out "nontherapeutic" antibiotics in U.S. food animal production. The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Edward "Ted" Kennedy</a>, died. The House bill, introduced by Rep. <a href="Louise%20Slaughter">Louise Slaughter</a>, died after being referred to Committee.

In March 2012, the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, ruling in an action brought by the <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Defense%20Council">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock that violated FDA regulations. On April 11, 2012 the FDA announced a voluntary program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and convert approved over-the-counter uses for antibiotics to prescription use only, requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription. In December 2013, the FDA announced the commencement of these steps to phase out the use of antibiotics for the purposes of promoting livestock growth.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to greater availability of "antibiotic-free" animal products. For example, chicken producer Perdue removed all human antibiotics from its feed and launched products labeled “antibiotic free” under the Harvestland brand in 2007. Consumer response was positive, and in 2014 Perdue also phased out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the “antibiotic free” labels on its Harvestland, Simply Smart, and Perfect Portions products.

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
Antibiotic resistance can be a result of <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>, and also of unlinked point mutations in the <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> <a href="genome">genome</a> at a rate of about 1 in 10 per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether.

Antibiotic action against a pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the <a href="microevolution">microevolution</a> of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis. manifesting, in slower growth rate.

In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to <a href="DNA%20gyrase">DNA gyrase</a>, protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or <a href="topoisomerase%20IV">topoisomerase IV</a> can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a <a href="selectable%20marker">selectable marker</a> to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. 

<a href="New%20Delhi%20metallo-beta-lactamase%201">NDM-1</a> is an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that makes <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> resistant to a broad range of <a href="beta-lactam%20antibiotic">beta-lactam antibiotic</a>s.

NDM-1 was first detected in a "<a href="Klebsiella%20pneumoniae">Klebsiella pneumoniae</a>" isolate from a <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> patient of <a href="India">India</a>n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the United States, <a href="http%3A//www.healthzone.ca/health/newsfeatures/article/850906">Canada</a> and <a href="http%3A//www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/08/japan_confirms_first_case_of_superbug_gene/">Japan</a>.

According to A "Lancet" study, NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. The study came to the conclusion that Indian hospitals are unsafe for treatment as <a href="Hospital-acquired%20infection">Nosocomial-infections</a> are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, it can be dangerous.

"<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" (colloquially known as "Staph aureus" or a "Staph infection") is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s and the <a href="human%20skin">human skin</a> of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. <a href="Methicillin">Methicillin</a> was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by <a href="oxacillin">oxacillin</a> because of significant kidney toxicity. <a href="Methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">Methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a> in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all "S. aureus" infections in the <a href="United%20States">US</a> are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, <a href="tetracycline">tetracycline</a> and <a href="erythromycin">erythromycin</a>.

This left <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a> as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4–8 μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate "Staphylococcus aureus" (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate "Staphylococcus aureus" (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (>16 μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed <a href="Vancomycin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">vancomycin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (VRSA) appeared in the United States in 2002. However, in 2011, a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity.

A new class of antibiotics, <a href="Linezolid">oxazolidinones</a>, became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, <a href="linezolid">linezolid</a>, is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid resistance in "S. aureus" was reported in 2001, but infection rates have been at consistently low levels and in the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from <a href="bacteremia">bacteremia</a> cases between 2001 and 2006.

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has now emerged as an epidemic that is responsible for rapidly progressive, fatal diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>, and <a href="necrotizing%20fasciitis">necrotizing fasciitis</a>. MRSA is the most frequently identified antimicrobial drug-resistant pathogen in US hospitals. The <a href="epidemiology">epidemiology</a> of infections caused by MRSA is rapidly changing. Since 2000, infections caused by this organism have emerged in the community. The two MRSA clones in the United States most closely associated with community outbreaks, <a href="USA400">USA400</a> (MW2 strain, ST1 lineage) and <a href="USA300">USA300</a>, often contain <a href="Panton-Valentine%20leukocidin">Panton-Valentine leukocidin</a> (PVL) genes and, more frequently, have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have been reported in correctional facilities, among athletic teams, among military recruits, in newborn nurseries, and among men that have sex with men. CA-MRSA infections now appear endemic in many urban regions and cause most CA-"S. aureus" infections.

"<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">Streptococcus pyogenes</a>" (Group A "Streptococcus": GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive-care unit may be needed. For persons with necrotizing fasciitis, surgery often is needed to remove damaged tissue. Strains of "S. pyogenes" resistant to <a href="macrolide">macrolide</a> antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>.

Resistance of "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>" to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. "S. pneumoniae" is responsible for <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="bacteremia">bacteremia</a>, <a href="otitis%20media">otitis media</a>, <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a>, <a href="peritonitis">peritonitis</a> and <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>.

Multidrug-resistant "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecalis">Enterococcus faecalis</a>" and "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecium">Enterococcus faecium</a>" are associated with <a href="nosocomial%20infection">nosocomial infection</a>s. These strains include: <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>-resistant "<a href="Enterococcus">Enterococcus</a>", <a href="vancomycin-resistant%20Enterococcus">vancomycin-resistant "Enterococcus"</a>, and <a href="linezolid">linezolid</a>-resistant "<a href="Enterococcus">Enterococcus</a>".

"<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" is a highly prevalent <a href="opportunistic%20pathogen">opportunistic pathogen</a>. One of the most worrisome characteristics of "P. aeruginosa" is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of <a href="efflux%20%28microbiology%29">multidrug efflux pumps</a> with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., "mexAB-oprM", "mexXY") and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes. "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" biofilms and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.

<a href="Clostridium%20difficile%20%28bacteria%29">"Clostridium difficile"</a> is a <a href="Hospital-acquired%20infection">nosocomial</a> pathogen that causes diarrheal disease worldwide. Diarrhea caused by "C. difficile" can be life-threatening. Infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. "C. difficile" infections commonly occur during hospitalization.

According to a 2015 CDC report, "C. difficile" caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that "C. difficile" infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.

"C. difficile" colitis is most strongly associated with <a href="fluoroquinolones">fluoroquinolones</a>, <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s, <a href="carbapenem">carbapenem</a>s, and <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>.

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of C. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] <a href="Clindamycin">Clindamycin</a>-resistant "C. difficile" was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992. Geographically dispersed outbreaks of "C. difficile" strains resistant to <a href="fluoroquinolone">fluoroquinolone</a> antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.

As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of <a href="Carbapenem-resistant%20enterobacteriaceae">carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae</a> (CRE) were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.

"Acinetobacter" is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. <a href="Acinetobacter%23Treatment">Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter</a> have become very resistant to antibiotics.

"<a href="Campylobacter">Campylobacter</a>" causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on <a href="ciprofloxacin">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a> for treating patients with severe disease although "Campylobacter" is showing resistance to these antibiotics.

Infection with "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" and "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" can result from the consumption of contaminated food and <a href="Water%20pollution">polluted water</a>. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use. When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of "E. coli" have become resistant to multiple types of <a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">fluoroquinolone antibiotics</a>.

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone. This study focused on the development of resistance in E. coli to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in E. coli developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics. <a href="Epigenetics">Epigenetics</a> is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including <a href="DNA%20methylation">methylation of DNA</a> and <a href="Histone">histone modification</a>; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.

Resistance to <a href="polymyxins">polymyxins</a> first appear in 2011. An easier way for this resistance to spread, a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> known as <a href="MCR-1">MCR-1</a> was discovered in 2015.

On November 5, 2004, the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) reported an increasing number of "<a href="Acinetobacter%20baumannii">Acinetobacter baumannii</a>" bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>/<a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> region during <a href="Iraq%20war">Operation Iraqi Freedom</a> and in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> during <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> were treated. Most of these showed <a href="multidrug%20resistance">multidrug resistance</a> (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.

Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (<a href="Beta-lactamase%23KPC%20%28K.%20pneumoniae%20carbapenemase%29%20%28Class%20A%29">KPC</a>)-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. "Klebsiella pneumoniae" includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements. <a href="Carbapenem">Carbapenem</a> antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.

<a href="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</a> is increasing across the globe, especially in developing countries, over the past few years. TB resistant to antibiotics is called <a href="Multi-drug-resistant%20tuberculosis">MDR TB</a> (Multidrug Resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually. The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this.

TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of <a href="Streptomycin">Streptomycin</a> by <a href="Selman%20Waksman">Selman Waksman</a> in 1943. However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as <a href="isoniazid">isoniazid</a> and <a href="rifampin">rifampin</a> have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. <a href="Extensively%20drug-resistant%20tuberculosis">Extensively Drug-Resistant TB</a> (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.

Resistance of "<a href="Mycobacterium%20tuberculosis">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a>" to <a href="isoniazid">isoniazid</a>, <a href="rifampin">rifampin</a>, and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. (For more on Drug-Resistant TB, visit the <a href="Multi-drug-resistant%20tuberculosis">Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis</a> page.) Evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids. Also "M. tuberculosis" lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.

<a href="Neisseria%20gonorrhoeae">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</a> is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>, a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum. It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications. The bacteria was first identified in 1879, although some Biblical scholars believe that references to the disease can be found as early as Parshat Metzora of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>.

In the 1940s effective treatment with <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> became available, but by the 1970s resistant strains predominated. Resistance to penicillin has developed through two mechanisms: chromasomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG). CMRNG involves step wise mutation of penA, which codes for the <a href="Penicillin%20binding%20proteins">penicillin-binding protein</a> (PBP-2); mtr, which encodes an <a href="Efflux%20%28microbiology%29">efflux pump</a> that removes penicillin from the cell; and penB, which encodes the bacterial cell wall <a href="Porin%20%28protein%29">porins</a>. PPNG involves the acquisition of a <a href="Plasmid-mediated%20resistance">plasmid-borne</a> <a href="beta-lactamase">beta-lactamase</a>. "N. gonorrheoea" has a high affinity for <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>, and as a result, the existence of any strain resistant to a given drug could spread easily across strains.

<a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">Fluoroquinolones</a> were a useful next-line treatment until resistance was achieved through efflux pumps and mutations to the gyrA gene, which encodes <a href="DNA%20gyrase">DNA gyrase</a>. Third-generation <a href="cephalosporins">cephalosporins</a> have been used to treat gonorrhoea since 2007, but resistant strains have emerged. As of 2010, the recommended treatment is a single 250 mg intramuscular injection of <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>, sometimes in combination with <a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a> or <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a>. However, certain strains of "N. gonorrhoeae" can be resistant to antibiotics usually that are normally used to treat it. These include: <a href="cefixime">cefixime</a> (an oral <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>), <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a> (an injectable cephalosporin), <a href="azithromycin">azithromycin</a>, <a href="aminoglycosides">aminoglycosides</a>, and <a href="tetracycline">tetracycline</a>.

"<a href="Mycoplasma%20genitalium">Mycoplasma genitalium</a>" is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with "Mycoplasma genitalium" sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the <a href="urethra">urethra</a> (<a href="urethritis">urethritis</a>) both in men and women, which is associated with <a href="mucopurulent%20discharge">mucopurulent discharge</a> in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of "Mycoplasma genitalium" infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that "Mycoplasma genitalium" infections are not routinely detected. Azithromycin is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin. An alternative five-day treatment with azithromycin showed no development of antimicrobial resistance. Efficacy of azithromycin against "Mycoplasma genitalium" has decreased substantially, which is thought to occur through <a href="Single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">SNP</a>s in the 23S rRNA gene. The same SNPs are thought to be responsible for resistance against <a href="josamycin">josamycin</a> which is prescribed in some countries. <a href="Moxifloxacin">Moxifloxacin</a> can be used as a second-line treatment in case azithromycin is not able to eradicate the infection. However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to "parC" <a href="Single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">SNP</a>s. <a href="Tetracyclines">Tetracyclines</a>, including <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a>, have a low clinical eradication rate for "Mycoplasma genitalium" infections. 
A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but <a href="pristinamycin">pristinamycin</a> was still able to eradicate the infection.

Specific <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20C">hepatitis C</a>, <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, <a href="herpesviridae">herpes viruses</a> including <a href="varicella%20zoster%20virus">varicella zoster virus</a>, <a href="cytomegalovirus">cytomegalovirus</a> and <a href="Epstein-Barr%20virus">Epstein-Barr virus</a>. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.

Resistance to HIV antivirals is problematic, and even multi-drug resistant strains have evolved. Resistant strains of the HIV virus emerge rapidly if only one antiviral drug is used. Using three or more drugs together has helped to control this problem, but new drugs are needed because of the continuing emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains.

Infections by fungi are a cause of high morbidity and mortality in <a href="Immunodeficiency">immunocompromised</a> persons, such as those with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or receiving <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. The fungi <a href="Candida%20%28fungus%29">candida</a>, "<a href="Cryptococcus%20neoformans">Cryptococcus neoformans</a>" and "<a href="Aspergillus%20fumigatus">Aspergillus fumigatus</a>" cause most of these infections and antifungal resistance occurs in all of them. Multidrug resistance in fungi is increasing because of the widespread use of antifungal drugs to treat infections in immunocompromised individuals.

Of particular note, <a href="Fluconazole">Fluconazole</a>-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC. More than 20 Candida species of Candida can cause <a href="Candidiasis">Candidiasis</a> infection, the most common of which is "<a href="Candida%20albicans">Candida albicans</a>". Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line <a href="Antifungal">antifungal agents</a> such as <a href="Azole%23Use%20as%20anti-fungal%20agents">azoles</a> and <a href="echinocandin">echinocandin</a>s.

The <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>n parasites that cause the diseases <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="trypanosomiasis">trypanosomiasis</a>, <a href="toxoplasmosis">toxoplasmosis</a>, <a href="cryptosporidiosis">cryptosporidiosis</a> and <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a> are important human pathogens.

Malarial parasites that are resistant to the drugs that are currently available to infections are common and this has led to increased efforts to develop new drugs. Resistance to recently developed drugs such as <a href="artemisinin">artemisinin</a> has also been reported. The problem of drug resistance in malaria has driven efforts to develop vaccines.

<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosomes</a> are parasitic protozoa that cause <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">African trypanosomiasis</a> and <a href="Chagas%20disease">Chagas disease</a> (American trypanosomiasis). There are no vaccines to prevent these infections so drugs such as <a href="pentamidine">pentamidine</a> and <a href="suramin">suramin</a>, <a href="benznidazole">benznidazole</a> and <a href="nifurtimox">nifurtimox</a> and used to treat infections. These drugs are effective but infections caused by resistant parasites have been reported.

<a href="Leishmaniasis">Leishmaniasis</a> is caused by protozoa and is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in sub-tropical and tropical countries. Drug resistance has "become a major concern".

Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>. By constructing a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> that contains an antibiotic-resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that, when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

In general, the most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are "older" antibiotics. These include:

In industry, the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored, since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of <a href="auxotrophic">auxotrophic</a> bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.

For the <a href="fiscal%20year">fiscal year</a> 2016 budget, President Obama has suggested to nearly double the amount of federal funding to "combat and prevent" antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2 billion. Many international funding agencies like USAID, DFID, SIDA and Bill & Melinda Gates foundation has pledged money for developing strategies to counter antimicrobial resistance.

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics". On January 20, 2016 at the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a> in <a href="Davos">Davos</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for 'transformational commercial models' at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".

Some global health scholars have argued that a global, legal framework is needed to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance. For instance, binding global policies could be used to create antimicrobial use standards, regulate antibiotic marketing, and strengthen global surveillance systems. Ensuring compliance of involved parties is a challenge. Global antimicrobial resistance policies could take lessons from the environmental sector by adopting strategies that have made international environmental agreements successful in the past such as: sanctions for non-compliance, assistance for implementation, majority vote decision-making rules, an independent scientific panel, and specific commitments.

Antigen

In <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, an antigen is a molecule <a href="Immunogenicity">capable</a> of inducing an <a href="immune%20response">immune response</a> (to produce an <a href="antibody">antibody</a>) in the <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">host organism</a>. Sometimes antigens are <a href="Autoimmunity">part of the host itself</a> in an <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>.

Antigens are "targeted" by antibodies. Each antibody (immune response) is specifically produced by the immune system to match an antigen after <a href="Antigen-presenting%20cell">cells</a> in the immune system come into contact with it; this allows a precise identification/matching of the antigen and the initiation of a <a href="Adaptive%20immune%20system">tailored response</a>. The antibody is said to "match" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an <a href="Somatic%20hypermutation">adaptation</a> performed to <a href="Complementarity%20determining%20region">a region of the antibody</a>; because of this, many different antibodies are produced, each with specificity to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic structure. In most cases, an adapted antibody can only react to and bind one specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may cross-react to and bind <a href="Cross-reactivity">more than one antigen</a>.

Also, an antigen is a <a href="molecule">molecule</a> that binds to Ag-specific receptors, but cannot necessarily induce an immune response in the body by itself. Antigens are usually <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s (amino acid chains), <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s (chains of monosaccharides/simple sugars) or <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s. In general, saccharides and lipids (as opposed to peptides) qualify as antigens but not as <a href="immunogen">immunogen</a>s since they cannot elicit an immune response on their own. Furthermore, for a peptide to induce an immune response (activation of T-cells by <a href="antigen-presenting%20cell">antigen-presenting cell</a>s) it must be a large enough size, since peptides too small will also not elicit an immune response. The term antigen originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody. It was expanded to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors (<a href="B-cell%20receptor">B-cell receptor</a> or <a href="T-cell%20receptor">T-cell receptor</a>) of the adaptive immune system.

The antigen may originate from within the body ("self-antigen") or from the external environment ("non-self"). <a href="Immune%20system">The immune system</a> usually does not react to self-antigens under normal <a href="homeostatic">homeostatic</a> conditions due to <a href="Negative%20selection%20%28immunology%29">negative selection</a> of <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s in the <a href="thymus">thymus</a> and is supposed to identify and attack "non-self" invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful substances present in the body under <a href="Danger%20model">distressed conditions</a>.

<a href="Antigen%20presenting%20cell">Antigen presenting cell</a>s present antigens in the form of peptides on <a href="histocompatibility%20molecule">histocompatibility molecule</a>s. The T cell/<a href="T%20lymphocyte">T lymphocyte</a> (a subtype of white blood cell), of the <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a>, selectively recognize the antigens. Depending on the antigen and the type of the histocompatibility molecule, different types of T cells will be activated. For <a href="T-cell%20receptor">T-Cell Receptor (TCR)</a> recognition, the peptide must be processed into small fragments inside the cell and presented by a <a href="major%20histocompatibility%20complex">major histocompatibility complex</a> (MHC). The antigen cannot elicit the immune response without the help of an <a href="adjuvant">immunologic adjuvant</a>. Similarly, the adjuvant component of <a href="vaccines">vaccines</a> plays an essential role in the activation of the innate immune system.

An <a href="immunogen">immunogen</a> is an antigen substance (or <a href="adduct">adduct</a>) that is able to trigger a humoral (innate) or cell-mediated immune response. It first initiates an <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune response</a>, which then causes the activation of the <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune response</a>. An antigen binds the highly variable immunoreceptor products (<a href="B-cell%20receptor">B-cell receptor</a> or <a href="T-cell%20receptor">T-cell receptor</a>) once these have been generated. Immunogens are those antigens, termed <a href="immunogenic">immunogenic</a>, capable of inducing an immune response.

At the molecular level, an antigen can be characterized by its ability to bind to an antibody's <a href="Fragment%20antigen-binding">variable Fab region</a>. Different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific <a href="epitope">epitope</a>s present on the antigen surface. A <a href="hapten">hapten</a> is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope. In order to induce an immune response, it needs to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a <a href="protein">protein</a> (a complex of peptides). Antigens are usually carried by <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s, and less frequently, <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s. This includes parts (coats, capsules, cell walls, flagella, fimbrae, and toxins) of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="virus">virus</a>es, and other <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s. <a href="Lipid">Lipid</a>s and <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides. Non-microbial non-self antigens can include pollen, egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells. <a href="Vaccine">Vaccine</a>s are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form, which are intentionally administered to a recipient to induce the memory function of <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a> toward the antigens of the pathogen invading that recipient.

<a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a> coined the term <a href="Antibody%23History">antibody</a> (in German "Antikörper") in his <a href="side-chain%20theory">side-chain theory</a> at the end of 19th century. In 1899, <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Detre%20%28physician%29">Ladislas Deutsch (Laszlo Detre)</a> (1874–1939) named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies "substances immunogenes ou antigenes" (antigenic or immunogenic substances). He originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies, just as <a href="zymogen">zymogen</a> is a precursor of an enzyme. But, by 1903, he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word "antigen" is a contraction of antisomatogen ("Immunkörperbildner"). The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" indicates that the logical construction should be "anti(body)-gen".


Antigens can be classified according to their source.

Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example by <a href="inhalation">inhalation</a>, <a href="ingestion">ingestion</a> or <a href="Injection%20%28medicine%29">injection</a>. The immune system's response to exogenous <a href="antigens">antigens</a> is often subclinical. By <a href="endocytosis">endocytosis</a> or <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>, exogenous antigens are taken into the <a href="antigen-presenting%20cell">antigen-presenting cell</a>s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to <a href="T%20helper%20cells">T helper cells</a> (<a href="CD4">CD4</a>) by the use of <a href="MHC%20class%20II">class II histocompatibility</a> molecules on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s, substances that activate <a href="cytotoxic%20T%20lymphocytes">cytotoxic T lymphocytes</a> (CTL), antibody-secreting <a href="B%20cell">B cell</a>s, <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a> and other particles.

Some antigens start out as exogenous, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell.

Endogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, or because of viral or intracellular bacterial <a href="infection">infection</a>. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with <a href="MHC%20class%20I">MHC class I</a> molecules. If activated <a href="Cytotoxic%20T%20cell">cytotoxic CD8 T cells</a> recognize them, the T cells secrete various <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s that cause the <a href="lysis">lysis</a> or <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, the cytotoxic cells (self-reactive T cells) are deleted as a result of <a href="Central%20tolerance">tolerance</a> (negative selection). Endogenous antigens include <a href="xenogenic">xenogenic</a> (heterologous), <a href="autologous">autologous</a> and <a href="idiotype">idiotypic</a> or <a href="immunoglobulin%20allotype">allogenic</a> (homologous) antigens.

An <a href="autoantigen">autoantigen</a> is usually a normal protein or protein complex (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>. Under normal conditions, these antigens should not be the target of the immune system, but in autoimmune diseases, their associated T cells are not deleted and instead attack.

Neoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome. As compared with nonmutated self-antigens, neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control, as the quality of the T cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central T cell tolerance. Technology to systematically analyze T cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently.

For virus-associated tumors, such as <a href="cervical%20cancer">cervical cancer</a> and a subset of <a href="head%20and%20neck%20cancers">head and neck cancers</a>, <a href="epitopes">epitopes</a> derived from viral open reading frames contribute to the pool of neoantigens.

"<a href="Tumor%20antigen">Tumor antigen</a>s" are those antigens that are presented by <a href="MHC%20class%20I">MHC class I</a> or <a href="MHC%20class%20II">MHC class II</a> molecules on the surface of <a href="tumor%20cell">tumor cell</a>s. Antigens found only on such cells are called <a href="tumor-specific%20antigen">tumor-specific antigen</a>s (TSAs) and generally result from a tumor-specific <a href="mutation">mutation</a>. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, called <a href="tumor-associated%20antigen">tumor-associated antigen</a>s (TAAs). <a href="Cytotoxic%20T%20lymphocytes">Cytotoxic T lymphocytes</a> that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy tumor cells.

Tumor antigens can appear on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they are recognized by <a href="B%20cells">B cells</a>.

For human tumors without a viral etiology, novel <a href="peptides">peptides</a> (neo-epitopes) are created by tumor-specific DNA alterations.

A large fraction of human tumor mutations are effectively patient-specific. Therefore, neoantigens may also be based on individual tumor genomes. Deep-sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part of the <a href="genome">genome</a> (the <a href="exome">exome</a>) and predict potential neoantigens. In mice models, for all novel protein sequences, potential MHC-binding peptides were predicted. The resulting set of potential neoantigens was used to assess T cell reactivity. Exome–based analyses were exploited in a clinical setting, to assess reactivity in patients treated by either <a href="tumor-infiltrating%20lymphocyte">tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte</a> (TIL) cell therapy or checkpoint blockade. Neoantigen identification was successful for multiple experimental model systems and human malignancies.

The false-negative rate of cancer exome sequencing is low—i.e.: the majority of neoantigens occur within exonic sequence with sufficient coverage. However, the vast majority of mutations within expressed genes do not produce neoantigens that are recognized by autologous T cells.

As of 2015 mass spectroscopy resolution is insufficient to exclude many false positives from the pool of peptides that may be presented by MHC molecules. Instead, algorithms are used to identify the most likely candidates. These algorithms consider factors such as the likelihood of <a href="proteasome">proteasomal</a> processing, transport into the <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>, affinity for the relevant MHC class I <a href="allele">allele</a>s and gene expression or protein translation levels.

The majority of human neoantigens identified in unbiased screens display a high predicted MHC binding affinity. Minor histocompatibility antigens, a conceptually similar antigen class are also correctly identified by MHC binding algorithms. Another potential filter examines whether the mutation is expected to improve MHC binding. The nature of the central TCR-exposed residues of MHC-bound peptides is associated with peptide immunogenicity.

A native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts. <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s cannot bind native antigens, but require that they be processed by APCs, whereas <a href="B%20cell">B cell</a>s can be activated by native ones.

Antigenic specificity is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen. It is measurable and need not be linear or of a rate-limited step or equation.

Autosome

An autosome is a <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> that is not an <a href="allosome">allosome</a> (a sex chromosome). The members of an autosome pair in a <a href="diploid">diploid</a> cell have the same morphology unlike those in allosome pairs which may have different structure. The <a href="DNA">DNA</a> in autosomes is collectively known as atDNA or auDNA.

For example, <a href="human">human</a>s have a <a href="diploid">diploid</a> <a href="human%20genome">genome</a> that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one <a href="allosome">allosome</a> pair (46 chromosomes total). The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers (1–22 in humans) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs, while allosomes are labelled with their letters. By contrast, the allosome pair consists of two <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a>s in females or one X and one <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> in males. (Unusual combinations of <a href="XYY%20syndrome">XYY</a>, <a href="Klinefelter%20syndrome">XXY</a>, <a href="Triple%20X%20syndrome">XXX</a>, <a href="XXXX%20syndrome">XXXX</a>, <a href="XXXXX%20syndrome">XXXXX</a> or <a href="XXYY%20syndrome">XXYY</a>, among <a href="Aneuploidy">other allosome combinations</a>, are known to occur and usually cause developmental abnormalities.)

Autosomes still contain sexual determination genes even though they are not sex chromosomes. For example, the <a href="SRY">SRY</a> gene on the Y chromosome encodes the transcription factor <a href="Testis%20determining%20factor">TDF</a> and is vital for male sex determination during development. TDF functions by activating the <a href="SOX9">SOX9</a> gene on <a href="Chromosome%2017%20%28human%29">chromosome 17</a>, so mutations of the <a href="SOX9">SOX9</a> gene can cause humans with a Y chromosome to develop as females.

All human autosomes have been identified and mapped by extracting the chromosomes from a cell arrested in <a href="metaphase">metaphase</a> or <a href="prometaphase">prometaphase</a> and then staining them with some sort of dye (most commonly, <a href="Giemsa%20stain">Giemsa</a>). These chromosomes are typically viewed as <a href="karyogram">karyogram</a>s for easy comparison. Clinical geneticists can compare the karyogram of an individual to a reference karyogram to discover the cytogenetic basis of certain <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s. For example, the karyogram of someone with <a href="Patau%20syndrome">Patau Syndrome</a> would show that they possess three copies of <a href="Chromosome%2013%20%28human%29">chromosome 13</a>. Karyograms and staining techniques can only detect large-scale disruptions to chromosomes—chromosomal aberrations smaller than a few million base pairs generally cannot be seen on a karyogram.

Autosomal genetic disorders can arise due to a number of causes, some of the most common being <a href="nondisjunction">nondisjunction</a> in parental germ cells or <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian inheritance</a> of deleterious alleles from parents. Autosomal genetic disorders which exhibit Mendelian inheritance can be inherited either in an <a href="autosomal%20dominant">autosomal dominant</a> or recessive fashion. These disorders manifest in and are passed on by either sex with equal frequency. Autosomal dominant disorders are often present in both parent and child, as the child needs to inherit only one copy of the deleterious <a href="allele">allele</a> to manifest the disease. Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. Because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as <a href="heterozygote">heterozygote</a>s) for the condition.

Autosomal <a href="aneuploidy">aneuploidy</a> can also result in disease conditions. Aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus. Fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-rich chromosomes—such as <a href="Chromosome%201%20%28human%29">chromosome 1</a>—never survive to term, and fetuses with aneuploidy of gene-poor chromosomes—such as <a href="Chromosome%2021%20%28human%29">chromosome 21</a>— are still miscarried over 23% of the time. Possessing a single copy of an autosome (known as a monosomy) is nearly always incompatible with life, though very rarely some monosomies can survive past birth. Having three copies of an autosome (known as a trisomy) is far more compatible with life, however. A common example is <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>, which is caused by possessing three copies of <a href="Chromosome%2021%20%28human%29">chromosome 21</a> instead of the usual two.

Partial aneuploidy can also occur as a result of <a href="Chromosomal%20translocation">unbalanced translocations</a> during meiosis. Deletions of part of a chromosome cause partial monosomies, while duplications can cause partial trisomies. If the duplication or deletion is large enough, it can be discovered by analyzing a karyogram of the individual. Autosomal translocations can be responsible for a number of diseases, ranging from <a href="cancer">cancer</a> to <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. Unlike single gene disorders, diseases caused by aneuploidy are the result of improper <a href="gene%20dosage">gene dosage</a>, not nonfunctional gene product.

Al-Qaeda

Al-Qaeda ( or ; ', , translation: "The Base", "The Foundation" or "<a href="Fundamentalism">The Fundament</a>" and alternatively spelled al-Qaida, al-Qæda and sometimes al-Qa'ida) is a <a href="militant">militant</a> <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a> <a href="International">multi-national</a> <a href="organization">organization</a> founded in 1988 by <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, <a href="Abdullah%20Azzam">Abdullah Azzam</a>, and several other <a href="Arab%20world">Arab</a> volunteers who fought against the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a> in the 1980s.

Al-Qaeda operates as a <a href="Social%20network">network</a> made up of <a href="Islamic%20extremist">Islamic extremist</a>, <a href="Salafi%20jihadism">Salafist jihadists</a>. It has been designated as a <a href="List%20of%20designated%20terrorist%20groups">terrorist group</a> by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO), the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, the United States, Russia, India, and various other countries (see <a href="%23Designation%20as%20terrorist%20group">below</a>). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on civilian and military targets in various countries, including the <a href="1998%20U.S.%20embassy%20bombings">1998 U.S. embassy bombings</a>, the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, and the <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">2002 Bali bombings</a>. The U.S. government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the "<a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a>". With the loss of key leaders, culminating in the <a href="death%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">death of Osama bin Laden</a>, al-Qaeda's operations have devolved from actions that were controlled from the , to actions by associated groups and "<a href="Lone%20wolf%20%28terrorism%29">lone-wolf</a>" operators. Characteristic techniques employed by al-Qaeda include <a href="suicide%20attack">suicide attack</a>s and the simultaneous bombing of different <a href="Target%20of%20opportunity">targets</a>. Activities ascribed to it may involve members of the <a href="Social%20movement">movement</a> who have made a <a href="Promise%23Islam">pledge</a> of <a href="loyalty">loyalty</a> to bin Laden, or the much more numerous "al-Qaeda-linked" individuals who have undergone <a href="Terrorist%20training%20camp">training in one of its camps</a> in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq or Sudan. Al-Qaeda <a href="ideologues">ideologues</a> envision a complete break from all foreign influences in <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim countries</a>, and the creation of a new <a href="Caliphatism">caliphate</a> ruling over the entire <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a>.

Among the <a href="Belief%23Religion">beliefs</a> ascribed to al-Qaeda members is the that a <a href="Christianity%20and%20Judaism">Christian–Jewish</a> alliance is <a href="Conspiracy%20%28civil%29">conspiring</a> to destroy <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. As <a href="Salafist%20jihadism">Salafist jihadists</a>, they believe that the killing of <a href="non-combatants">non-combatants</a> is <a href="Social%20control">religiously sanctioned</a>, but they ignore any aspect of <a href="Religious%20text%23Islam">religious scripture</a> which might be interpreted as forbidding the murder of non-combatants and <a href="Internecine%20war">internecine fighting</a>. Al-Qaeda also opposes what it regards as <a href="man-made%20law">man-made law</a>s, and it wants to replace them with a strict form of <a href="sharia%20law">sharia law</a>.

Al-Qaeda has carried out many attacks on targets it considers "<a href="kafir">kafir</a>". Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating <a href="sectarian%20violence%20among%20Muslims">sectarian violence among Muslims</a>. Al-Qaeda's leaders regard <a href="Liberal%20movements%20within%20Islam">liberal Muslims</a>, <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shias</a>, <a href="Sufism">Sufis</a> and other <a href="sects">sects</a> as <a href="Bid%27ah">heretical</a> and its members and sympathizers have attacked their <a href="mosque">mosque</a>s and gatherings. Examples of sectarian attacks include the <a href="2007%20Yazidi%20communities%20bombings">Yazidi community bombings</a>, the <a href="23%20November%202006%20Sadr%20City%20bombings">Sadr City bombings</a>, the <a href="Ashoura%20massacre">Ashoura massacre</a> and the <a href="18%20April%202007%20Baghdad%20bombings">April 2007 Baghdad bombings</a>.

Since the death of bin Laden in 2011, the group has been led by the Egyptian <a href="Ayman%20al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>.

Al-Qaeda's philosophy has been described as "<a href="centralization">centralization</a> of decision and <a href="decentralization">decentralization</a> of execution." It is thought that al-Qaeda's leadership, after the <a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a>, has "become geographically isolated," leading to the "emergence of decentralized leadership" of regionalized al-Qaeda groups.

Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership. Although bin Laden still held considerable ideological sway over some <a href="Muslim%20extremists">Muslim extremists</a> before his death, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another. <a href="Marc%20Sageman">Marc Sageman</a>, a psychiatrist and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, said that al-Qaeda is now just a "loose label for a movement that seems to target the west. There is no umbrella organisation. We like to create a mythical entity called [al-Qaeda] in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with."

This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with <a href="Tayseer%20Allouni">Tayseer Allouni</a>:

... this matter isn't about any specific person and... is not about the al-Qa'idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public *** which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.

<a href="Bruce%20Hoffman">Bruce Hoffman</a>, however, sees al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.
Al-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:


Al-Qaeda's indirect affiliates includes the following, some of which have left the organization and joined the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a>:

<a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> was the most historically notable <a href="emir">emir</a>, or commander, and Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaeda prior to his assassination on May 1, 2011, by U.S. forces. <a href="Atiyah%20Abd%20al-Rahman">Atiyah Abd al-Rahman</a> was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011.

Bin Laden was advised by a <a href="shura">Shura Council</a>, which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials to consist of 20–30 people.

<a href="Ayman%20al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, al-Qaeda's Deputy Operations Chief prior to bin Laden's death, assumed the role of commander, according to an announcement by al-Qaeda on June 16, 2011. He replaced <a href="Saif%20al-Adel">Saif al-Adel</a>, who had served as interim commander.

On June 5, 2012, Pakistan intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor <a href="Abu%20Yahya%20al-Libi">Abu Yahya al-Libi</a> had been killed in Pakistan.

<a href="Nasir%20al-Wuhayshi">Nasir al-Wuhayshi</a> was said to have become second in command in 2013. He was the leader of <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Arabian%20Peninsula">al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula</a> (AQAP), until he was killed in a U.S. airstrike in June 2015.

Al-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network that draws on leaders of all its regional nodes "as and when necessary to serve as an integral part of its high command."

Al-Qaeda is not <a href="Military%20operation">operationally</a> managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Operational groups consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation (<a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20International%20Center%20for%20Scholars">The Wilson Centre</a> 2015). 
When asked about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the <a href="July%207%2C%202005%20London%20bombings">July 7, 2005 London bombings</a> in 2005, <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Commissioner">Metropolitan Police Commissioner</a> <a href="Sir%20Ian%20Blair">Sir Ian Blair</a> said: "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think that is what has occurred here."

On August 13, 2005, however, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" newspaper, quoting police and <a href="MI5">MI5</a> investigations, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad.

What exactly al-Qaeda is, or was, remains in dispute. Certainly, it has been obliged to evolve and adapt in the aftermath of 9/11 and the launch of the 'war on terror'.

Nasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 gives a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time in his memoir. He describes its formal administrative structure and vast arsenal, as well as day-to-day life as a member.

However, author and journalist <a href="Adam%20Curtis">Adam Curtis</a> argues that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contends the name "al-Qaeda" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the <a href="1998%20US%20embassy%20bombings">1998 US embassy bombings</a> in East Africa:

The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term "al-Qaeda" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.

As a matter of law, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">US Department of Justice</a> needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him <a href="trial%20in%20absentia">"in absentia"</a> under the <a href="Racketeer%20Influenced%20and%20Corrupt%20Organizations%20Act">Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act</a>, also known as the RICO statutes. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of <a href="Jamal%20al-Fadl">Jamal al-Fadl</a>, who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden. Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a> agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack U.S. military establishments. Sam Schmidt, one of his defense lawyers, said:

There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.

The number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden compound in 2011, show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170. In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries. , it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.

According to the award-winning 2004 BBC documentary "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Nightmares">The Power of Nightmares</a>", al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.

According to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was "organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces" in the Soviet-Afghan war. It was made up primarily of foreign "mujahideen" from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global "jihad". Another group, approximately 10,000 strong, live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training.

Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being "predominantly Arab," in its first years of operation, and now also includes "other peoples" . It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.

Some financing for al-Qaeda in the 1990s came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden. Other sources of income in 2001 included the <a href="heroin%20trade">heroin trade</a> and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic <a href="Arab%20states%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf">Gulf states</a>. A <a href="WikiLeaks">WikiLeaks</a> released memo from the United States Secretary of State sent in 2009 asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia.

Among the first pieces of evidence of Saudi Arabia’s conspicuous support for al-Qaeda was the so-called "<a href="The%20Golden%20Chain">Golden Chain</a>", a list of early al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid at the premises of the Benevolence International Foundation (BIF) in Sarajevo by Bosnian police. The hand-written list, validated by al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, included the names of both donors and beneficiaries. Osama bin-Laden’s name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries, while 20 Saudi and Gulf-based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors. Besides Osama bin Laden, among the most notable Saudi recipients were Adel Batterjee (founder of BIF and designated as a terror financier by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2004) and Wael Hamza Julaidan (U.S.-terrorist designated in 2002 as one of al-Qaeda’s founder).

The most prominent Saudi figures among the donors included Saudi billionaire <a href="Saleh%20Kamel">Saleh Kamel</a> (CEO of Dallah Al-Baraka, accused of funding and supporting al-Qaeda operations), Sulaiman Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi (funder of SAAR Foundation, shut down within the framework of Operation Green Quest, and CEO of al-Rajhi Bank, investigated several times by U.S. authorities for its role in financing terrorism and al-Qaeda especially), and Ahmad Turki Yamani (son of former Saudi chief of Justice and former Saudi Minister of Petroleum). Saleh Kamel’s case in particular reinforces Saudi Arabia’s role as sponsor of al-Qaeda. For years, Omar al-Bayoumi, an associate of Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, two 9/11 highjackers, received a stipend from al-Baraka, the financial group kamel directed. Kamel invested for several years in a Sudanese bank that held accounts under the names of senior al-Qaeda affiliates. According to the "Wall Street Journal", the Jidda-based al-Baraka Bank, one of the biggest subsidiaries of the financial group, was also suspected of providing banking services to al-Qaeda operatives. In general, the documents seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid pointed out that al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe. This was the case, for instance, with the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). The former had solid ties with al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including al-Qaeda’s deputy Ayman al Zawahiri’s brother working for IIRO in Albania who had actively recruited on behalf of al-Qaeda and involved several Egyptian Islamic Jihad members in IIRO activities. The latter was openly identified by al-Qaeda’s leader as one of the three charities al-Qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources.

Qatar has provided financial support to al-Qaeda as well. On December 18, 2013, the U.S. Treasury designated Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen close to the al-Thani family and a human rights activist who founded the Swiss-based NGO Alkarama, as a global terrorist for his activities in support to al-Qaeda. The U.S. Treasury has stated that Nuaimi, currently enjoying impunity in Qatar, "has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors".

Nuaimi was also accused of overseeing a $2 million monthly transfer to al-Qaeda in Iraq for a period of time as part of his role as mediator between Iraq-based al-Qaeda senior officers and Qatari citizens. He also allegedly entertained relationships with Abu-Khalid al-Suri, al-Qaeda’s top envoy in Syria, who processed a $600,000 transfer to al-Qaeda in 2013. Moreover, Nuaimi is known to be associated with Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, a Yemeni politician and founding member of Alkarama listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the U.S. Treasury in 2013. The U.S. authorities claimed that Humayqani exploited his role in Alkarama to fundraise on behalf of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). A prominent figure among AQAP ranks, he was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to AQAP affiliates based in Yemen. Nuaimi was accused of investing funds in the charity directed by Humayqani to ultimately fund AQAP. About ten months after being sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, Nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the UK.

Another Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a "Gulf-based al-Qaeda financier". Subayi’s name was added to the UN Security Council’s Sanctions List in 2008 upon charges of providing financial and material support to al-Qaeda senior leadership. Subayi allegedly moved al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps. He also supported financially Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attack according to the 9/11 Commission Report. Besides the activities of key facilitators, Qatar’s financial support to al-Qaeda has been channeled through Qatar’s largest NGO, the Qatar Charitable Society currently known as <a href="Qatar%20Charity">Qatar Charity</a>. Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was also a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity’s director, was affiliated to al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the National Islamic Front, a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in Sudan in the early 1990s.

Legal proceedings from the trial "United States vs. Enaam M. Arnaout" also mentioned that Qatar Charity was cited by Bin Laden in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas. The same documents also report Bin Laden’s complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of it before 1995.
Qatar Charity’s track record of terror financing includes support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya, an accusation publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani. In 1999 Qatar Charity supposedly funneled money to Chechnya-based al-Qaeda affiliates. Furthermore, Qatar Charity is among the NGOs allegedly channelling funds to Ansar Dine in North Mali, a piece of information confirmed by French military intelligence reports dating back to France’s intervention in the country in early 2013. The group has long been suspected of having ties to al-Qaeda.

Today, Qatar’s enduring financing of al-Qaeda’s enterprises mostly benefits al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria Jabhat al-Nusra and is channeled primarily through kidnapping for ransom. The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF) reported that the Gulf country has thus funded al-Nusra since 2013. Al-Awsat estimated that Qatar disbursed $25 million in support of al-Nusra through kidnapping for ransom. In addition to this strategy, Qatar has also launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of al-Nusra. The "Washington Post" reporter Joby Warrick wrote in December 2013 that al-Nusra acknowledged a Qatar-sponsored campaign ("Madid [sic] Ahl al-Sham") "as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group".

On March 11, 2005, "<a href="Al-Quds%20Al-Arabi">Al-Quds Al-Arabi</a>" published extracts from <a href="Saif%20al-Adel">Saif al-Adel</a>'s document "Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020". <a href="Abdel%20Bari%20Atwan">Abdel Bari Atwan</a> summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the <a href="Ummah">Ummah</a> from all forms of oppression:

Atwan also noted, regarding the collapse of the US, "If this sounds far-fetched, it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">downfall of the Soviet Union</a>."

According to <a href="Fouad%20Hussein">Fouad Hussein</a>, a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy plan consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020:

According to the seven-phase strategy, the war isn't projected to last longer than two years.

According to Charles Lister of the <a href="Middle%20East%20Institute">Middle East Institute</a> and Katherine Zimmerman of the <a href="American%20Enterprise%20Institute">American Enterprise Institute</a>, the new model of al-Qaeda is to "socialise communities" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.

The English name of the organization is a simplified <a href="Romanization%20of%20Arabic">transliteration</a> of the Arabic noun "" (), which means "the foundation" or "the base". The initial "al-" is the Arabic <a href="definite%20article">definite article</a> "the", hence "the base".

In Arabic, "al-Qaeda" has four syllables (). However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name (the <a href="voiceless%20uvular%20plosive">voiceless uvular plosive</a> and the <a href="voiced%20pharyngeal%20fricative">voiced pharyngeal fricative</a> ) are not <a href="phone%20%28phonetics%29">phones</a> found in the English language, the common naturalized <a href="English%20phonology">English pronunciations</a> include , and . Al-Qaeda's name can also be <a href="transliteration">transliterated</a> as "al-Qaida", "al-Qa'ida", or "el-Qaida".

Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with <a href="Al%20Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> journalist <a href="Tayseer%20Alouni">Tayseer Alouni</a> in October 2001:
The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our "mujahedeen" against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.

It has been argued that two documents seized from the <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> office of the <a href="Benevolence%20International%20Foundation">Benevolence International Foundation</a> prove that the name was not simply adopted by the "mujahid" movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term "al-Qaeda".

Former British Foreign Secretary <a href="Robin%20Cook">Robin Cook</a> wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as "the database", and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of "mujahideen" militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians. In April 2002, the group assumed the name "Qa'idat al-Jihad" ( ""), which means "the base of Jihad". According to <a href="Al-Ahram%20Center%20for%20Political%20and%20Strategic%20Studies">Diaa Rashwan</a>, this was "apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's <a href="Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad">al-Jihad</a> (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by <a href="Ayman%20al-Zawahiri">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s."

The radical <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a> movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the <a href="Islamic%20revival">Islamic revival</a> and the rise of the <a href="Islamism">Islamist movement</a> during the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.

Some have argued that "without the writings" of Islamic author and thinker <a href="Sayyid%20Qutb">Sayyid Qutb</a>, "al-Qaeda would not have existed." In the 1950s-60s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of "<a href="sharia">sharia</a>" law, the <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a> was no longer <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as "<a href="jahiliyyah">jahiliyyah</a>". To restore Islam, he said that a <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> movement of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish "true <a href="Islamic%20state%20%28government%29">Islamic states</a>", implement "sharia", and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like <a href="socialism">socialism</a> and <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>. In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included "treacherous Orientalists" and "<a href="Jews">world Jewry</a>," who plotted "<a href="List%20of%20conspiracy%20theories%23Antisemitism">conspiracies</a>" and "wicked[ly]" opposed Islam.

In the words of <a href="Mohammed%20Jamal%20Khalifa">Mohammed Jamal Khalifa</a>, a close college friend of bin Laden: Islam is different from any other <a href="religion">religion</a>; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.

Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden's mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate – one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. "Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb's character and the torment he had endured in prison." Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work "Knights under the Prophet's Banner."

One of the most powerful of Qutb's ideas was his belief that many who said they were Muslims were really not. Rather, they were <a href="apostate">apostate</a>s. That not only gave jihadists "a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim," but made "it a religious obligation to execute" these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce "sharia" law.

The <a href="Afghan%20Arabs">Afghan jihad</a> against the pro-Soviet government (December 1979 to February 1989) developed the <a href="Salafi%20jihadism">Salafist Jihadist</a> movement of which Al-Qaeda was the most prominent example.

<a href="Abdel%20Bari%20Atwan">Abdel Bari Atwan</a> writes that:

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" has described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: beginnings in the late 1980s, a "wilderness" period in 1990–96, its "heyday" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today.

The origins of al-Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">Soviet War in Afghanistan</a> (December 1979 – February 1989). The US viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, with the Afghan <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>s and allied Soviet troops on one side and the native Afghan "mujahideen", some of whom were radical Islamic militants, on the other, as a blatant case of Soviet expansionism and aggression.

A <a href="CIA">CIA</a> program called <a href="Operation%20Cyclone">Operation Cyclone</a> channeled funds through Pakistan's <a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">Inter-Services Intelligence</a> agency to the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviet occupation. US government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial. Aid to <a href="Gulbuddin%20Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>, an Afghan "mujahideen" leader and founder and leader of the <a href="Hezb-e%20Islami">Hezb-e Islami</a> radical Islamic militant faction, alone amounted "by the most conservative estimates" to $600 million. In addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion's share of Saudi aid. (Later, in the early 1990s, after the US had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar "worked closely" with bin Laden.)

At the same time, a growing number of Arab "mujahideen" joined the "jihad" against the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">Afghan Marxist regime</a>, facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the <a href="Maktab%20al-Khidamat">Maktab al-Khidamat</a> (MAK), which was funded by the Saudi Arabia government as well as by individual Muslims (particularly Saudi businessmen who were approached by bin Laden). Together, these sources donated some $600 million a year to jihad. In 1984, MAK, or the "Services Office", was established in <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>, Pakistan, by bin Laden and <a href="Abdullah%20Yusuf%20Azzam">Abdullah Yusuf Azzam</a>, a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the <a href="Muslim%20Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a>. MAK organized <a href="al-Qaeda%20safe%20house">guest houses</a> in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. Bin Laden became a "major financier" of the "mujahideen", spending his own money and using his connections with "the Saudi royal family and the petro-billionaires of the Gulf" to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds.
From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the US, the hub of which was the <a href="Al%20Kifah%20Refugee%20Center">Al Kifah Refugee Center</a> at the Farouq Mosque on <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were "double agent" <a href="Ali%20Mohamed">Ali Mohamed</a>, whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called "bin Laden's first trainer", and "Blind Sheikh" <a href="Omar%20Abdel-Rahman">Omar Abdel-Rahman</a>, a leading recruiter of "mujahideen" for Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda evolved from MAK. Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.

MAK and foreign "mujahideen" volunteers, or "Afghan Arabs," did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan "mujahideen" fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign "mujahideen" in the field at any one time. Nonetheless, foreign "mujahideen" volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000. Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers.

The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. To the surprise of many, <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a>'s Communist Afghan government hung on for three more years, before being overrun by elements of the "mujahideen". With "mujahideen" leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, chaos ensued, with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill-defined territories, leaving the country devastated.

Toward the end of the <a href="Red%20Army">Soviet military</a> mission in Afghanistan, some foreign "mujahideen" wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.

Wright's research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between "several senior leaders" of <a href="Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad">Egyptian Islamic Jihad</a>, <a href="Abdullah%20Yusuf%20Azzam">Abdullah Azzam</a>, and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.

Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: "basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge ("<a href="Bay%27at">bayat</a>") to follow one's superiors. In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, <a href="Nasser%20al-Bahri">Nasser al-Bahri</a>, gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving "bayat" when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief. According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret."

After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden's organization.

In November 1989, <a href="Ali%20Mohamed">Ali Mohamed</a>, a former special forces sergeant stationed at <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a>, North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became "deeply involved with bin Laden's plans." In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The <a href="Iraqi%20invasion%20of%20Kuwait">Iraqi invasion of Kuwait</a> in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling <a href="House%20of%20Saud">House of Saud</a> at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.

In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his "mujahideen" to <a href="Fahd%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">King Fahd</a> to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.

The deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the "land of the two mosques" (<a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina">Medina</a>) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.

From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician <a href="Hassan%20al-Turabi">Hassan al-Turabi</a>. The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel <a href="Omar%20al-Bashir">Omar al-Bashir</a>, who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established camps where insurgents trained.

A key turning point for bin Laden, further pitting him against the Sauds, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the <a href="Oslo%20Accords">Oslo Accords</a>, which set a path for peace between Israel and <a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>.

Zawahiri and the EIJ, who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government, had bad luck in Sudan. In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, <a href="Atef%20Sedki">Atef Sedki</a>. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.

Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994 Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport; bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his stipend, $7 million a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen. His family publicly disowned him. There is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and/or the Saudi government.

In June 1995, an even more ill-fated <a href="Attempted%20assassination%20of%20President%20Hosni%20Mubarak">attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak</a> led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, an expulsion of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government occured as well.

According to <a href="Pakistani-American">Pakistani-American</a> businessman <a href="Mansoor%20Ijaz">Mansoor Ijaz</a>, the Sudanese government offered the <a href="Clinton%20Administration">Clinton Administration</a> numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Ijaz's claims appeared in numerous <a href="Op-Ed">Op-Ed</a> pieces, including one in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" and one in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan <a href="Timothy%20M.%20Carney">Timothy M. Carney</a>. Similar allegations have been made by "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" contributing editor David Rose, and <a href="Richard%20Miniter">Richard Miniter</a>, author of "Losing bin Laden", in a November 2003 interview with "<a href="World%20%28magazine%29">World</a>".

Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the US (the <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a>), which concluded in part: Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the US. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.

After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various "mujahideen" groups.

The origins of the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> (literally "students") lay in the children of Afghanistan, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools (<a href="madrassa">madrassa</a>s) either in <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.

According to <a href="Ahmed%20Rashid">Ahmed Rashid</a>, five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of <a href="Darul%20Uloom%20Haqqania">Darul Uloom Haqqania</a>, a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak. The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but largely attended by <a href="Afghan%20refugees">Afghan refugees</a>. This institution reflected <a href="Salafi">Salafi</a> beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Bin Laden's contacts were still laundering most of these donations, using "unscrupulous" Islamic banks to transfer the money to an "array" of charities which serve as front groups for al-Qaeda, or transporting cash-filled suitcases straight into Pakistan. Another four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.

Many of the "mujahideen" who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord <a href="Mohammad%20Nabi%20Mohammadi">Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi</a>'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing internecine strife between various factions, and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal, enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan</a>. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, conquered the capital city <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> in September 1996.

After the Sudanese made it clear, in May 1996, that bin Laden would never be welcome to return, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan – with previously established connections between the groups, administered with a shared militancy, and largely isolated from American political influence and military power – provided a perfect location for al-Qaeda to relocate its headquarters. Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of <a href="055%20Brigade">Brigade 055</a>, an elite part of the Taliban's army from 1997–2001. The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters, many veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to head into Pakistan along with bin Laden.

By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda, while others cast doubt on this. According to senior US military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.

Around 1994, the Salafi groups waging <a href="Salafi%20jihadism">Salafi jihadism</a> in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline. As they grew less and less aggressive, groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist <a href="Clandestine%20cell%20system">cells</a> in Bosnia in late 1995.

At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for "<a href="Jihadi%20international">Jihadi international</a>" Muslims who believed that extremist-"jihad" must be fought on a global level. The concept of a "global Salafi "jihad"" had been around since at least the early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land at the same time and with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy.

Al-Qaeda sought to open the "offensive phase" of the global Salafi "jihad". Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for "solidarity with Islamic causes around the world", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.

In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its "jihad" to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a "fatwa" (binding religious edict), which amounted to a public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes.

On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a "fatwa" calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies where they can, when they can. Under the banner of the <a href="World%20Islamic%20Front">World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders</a>, they declared:

[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah'.

Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a "fatwa". However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary "<a href="ulema">ulema</a>" (which they saw as the paid servants of "<a href="jahiliyya">jahiliyya</a>" rulers), and took it upon themselves.

Al-Qaeda is <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a>, and often attacked the Iraqi <a href="Shia">Shia</a> majority in an attempt to incite <a href="sectarian%20violence">sectarian violence</a> and greater chaos in the country. Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings. The same month, a statement claiming to be by AQI rejected as "fake" a letter allegedly written by al-Zawahiri, in which he appears to question the insurgents' tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shiites in Iraq. In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians committed by "hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks".

US and Iraqi officials accused AQI of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's majority Shiites and minority Sunni Arabs, with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets. With attacks such as the 2003 <a href="Imam%20Ali%20Mosque">Imam Ali Mosque</a> bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 <a href="2006%20al-Askari%20Mosque%20bombing">first al-Askari Mosque bombing</a> in <a href="Samarra">Samarra</a>, the deadly single-day <a href="November%2023%2C%202006%20Sadr%20City%20bombings">series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed</a> in Baghdad's Shiite district of <a href="Sadr%20City">Sadr City</a>, and the <a href="2007%20al-Askari%20Mosque%20bombing">second al-Askari bombing</a> in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in <a href="death%20squad">death squad</a>-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent anarchy in 2007. In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda in Iraq killed <a href="2008%20Karbala%20bombing">at least 42 people</a> at the <a href="Imam%20Husayn%20Shrine">Imam Husayn Shrine</a> in Karbala in March, and <a href="17%20June%202008%20Baghdad%20bombing">at least 51 people</a> at a bus stop in Baghdad in June.

In February 2014, after a prolonged dispute with al-Qaeda in Iraq's successor organisation, the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIS), al-Qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and "notorious intractability".

In Somalia, al-Qaeda agents had been collaborating closely with its Somali wing, which was created from the al-Shabaab group. In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially joined al-Qaeda, declaring loyalty in a joint video. The Somalian al-Qaeda actively recruit children for suicide-bomber training, and export young people to participate in military actions against Americans at the AfPak border.

The percentage of terrorist attacks in the West originating from the Afghanistan-Pakistan (<a href="AfPak">AfPak</a>) border declined considerably from almost 100% to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen. While al-Qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border, the middle-tier of the movement display heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen.
"We know that South Asia is no longer their primary base," a US defense agency source said. "They are looking for a hide-out in other parts of the world, and continue to expand their organization."

In January 2009, al-Qaeda's division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Arabian%20Peninsula">al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula</a>. Centered in Yemen, the group takes advantage of the country's poor economy, demography and domestic security. In August 2009, they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades. President Obama asked his Yemen counterpart <a href="Ali%20Abdullah%20Saleh">Ali Abdullah Saleh</a> to ensure closer cooperation with the US in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid. Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US was unable to pay sufficient attention to Somalia and Yemen, which could cause problems in the near future. In December 2011, US Secretary of Defense <a href="Leon%20Panetta">Leon Panetta</a> said that the US operations against al-Qaeda "are now concentrating on key groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa." Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on <a href="Northwest%20Airlines%20Flight%20253">Northwest Airlines Flight 253</a> by <a href="Umar%20Farouk%20Abdulmutallab">Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab</a>. The group released photos of Abdulmutallab smiling in a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap, with the al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background. The AQAP declared the Al-Qaeda Emirate in Yemen in March 31, 2011, after capturing the most of the <a href="Abyan%20Governorate">Abyan Governorate</a>.

As the <a href="Saudi%20Arabian-led%20intervention%20in%20Yemen">Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen</a> escalated in July 2015, "The Guardian" wrote: "As another 50 civilians die in the forgotten war, only Isis and al-Qaida are gaining from a conflict tearing Yemen apart and leaving 20 million people in need of aid." In February 2016, al-Qaeda forces and <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>n-led coalition forces were both seen fighting Houthi rebels in the same battle.

In December 1998, the Director of the CIA <a href="Counterterrorism%20Center">Counterterrorism Center</a> reported to the president that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the USA, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft. On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda <a href="September%2011%20attacks">attacked the United States</a>, hijacking four airliners within the country and deliberately crashing two into the twin towers of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and the third into the western side of <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> in <a href="Arlington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Arlington County, Virginia</a>. The fourth, however, failed to reach its intended target – either the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> or the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, both located in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> – due to the rebellion by the passengers to retake the airliner, and instead crashed into the field in <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a>. In total, the attackers killed 2,977 victims and injured more than 6,000 others.

U.S. officials called <a href="Anwar%20al-Awlaki">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> an "example of al-Qaeda reach into" the U.S. in 2008 after probes into his ties to the September 11 attacks hijackers. A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known "senior recruiter for al-Qaeda", and a spiritual motivator. Awlaki's sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers, as well as accused <a href="2009%20Fort%20Hood%20shooting">Fort Hood shooter</a> <a href="Nidal%20Malik%20Hasan">Nidal Malik Hasan</a>. U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009. On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan's actions in the Fort Hood shooting.

An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki "has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the U.S. [in 2002], including plotting attacks against America and our allies."

U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> approved the <a href="targeted%20killing">targeted killing</a> of al-Awlaki by April 2010, making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list. That required the consent of the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Security%20Council">U.S. National Security Council</a>, and officials said it was appropriate for an individual who posed an imminent danger to national security. In May 2010, <a href="Faisal%20Shahzad">Faisal Shahzad</a>, who pleaded guilty to the <a href="2010%20Times%20Square%20car%20bombing%20attempt">2010 Times Square car bombing attempt</a>, told interrogators he was "inspired by" al-Awlaki, and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the internet. Representative <a href="Jane%20Harman">Jane Harman</a> called him "terrorist number one", and "<a href="Investor%27s%20Business%20Daily">Investor's Business Daily</a>" called him "the world's most dangerous man". In July 2010, the <a href="U.S.%20Treasury%20Department">US Treasury Department</a> added him to its list of <a href="Specially%20Designated%20Global%20Terrorist">Specially Designated Global Terrorist</a>s, and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda. In August 2010, al-Awlaki's father initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. government with the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki. In October 2010, U.S. and U.K. officials linked al-Awlaki to the <a href="2010%20cargo%20plane%20bomb%20plot">2010 cargo plane bomb plot</a>. In September 2011, he was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen. It was reported on March 16, 2012, that <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> plotted to kill United States President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>.

On May 1, 2011, in Washington, D.C. (May 2, <a href="Pakistan%20Standard%20Time">Pakistan Standard Time</a>), U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed by "a small team of Americans" acting under Obama's direct orders, <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden%27s%20hideout%20compound">in a covert operation</a> in <a href="Abbottabad">Abbottabad</a>, Pakistan, about north of Islamabad. According to U.S. officials a team of 20–25 <a href="US%20Navy%20SEALs">US Navy SEALs</a> under the command of the <a href="Joint%20Special%20Operations%20Command">Joint Special Operations Command</a> and working with the CIA stormed bin Laden's compound in two helicopters. Bin Laden and those with him were killed during a firefight in which U.S. forces experienced no casualties. According to one US official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Pakistani authorities. In Pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by US armed forces. The site is a few miles from the <a href="Pakistan%20Military%20Academy">Pakistan Military Academy</a> in <a href="Kakul">Kakul</a>. In his broadcast announcement President Obama said that U.S. forces "took care to avoid civilian casualties."
Details soon emerged that three men and a woman were killed along with bin Laden, the woman being killed when she was "used as a shield by a male combatant". <a href="DNA">DNA</a> from bin Laden's body, compared with DNA samples on record from his dead sister, confirmed bin Laden's identity. The body was recovered by the US military and was in its custody until, according to one US official, his body was <a href="Burial%20at%20sea">buried at sea</a> according to Islamic traditions. One U.S. official stated that "finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world's most wanted terrorist would have been difficult." U.S State Department issued a "Worldwide caution" for Americans following bin Laden's death and U.S Diplomatic facilities everywhere were placed on high alert, a senior U.S official said. Crowds gathered outside the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and in New York City's <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> to celebrate bin Laden's death.

In 2003, President <a href="Bashar%20al-Assad">Bashar al-Assad</a> revealed in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted that al-Qaeda even existed. He was quoted as saying, "Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?" He went on further to remark about bin Laden commenting, he "cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world? This is illogical."

Following the mass protests that took place later in 2011 demanding the resignation of al-Assad, al-Qaeda affiliated groups and Sunni sympathizers soon began to constitute the most effective fighting force in the Syrian opposition. Until then, al-Qaeda's presence in Syria was not worth mentioning, but its growth thereafter was rapid. Groups such as the <a href="al-Nusra%20Front">al-Nusra Front</a> and the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIS; sometimes ISIL) have recruited many foreign <a href="Mujahideen">Mujahideen</a> to train and fight in what has gradually become a highly sectarian war. Ideologically, the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a> has served the interests of al-Qaeda as it pits a mainly Sunni opposition against a Shia backed government. Viewing <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia Islam</a> as heretical, al-Qaeda and other fundamentalist Sunni militant groups have invested heavily in the civil conflict, actively backing and supporting the <a href="Syrian%20Opposition">Syrian Opposition</a> despite its clashes with moderate opposition groups such as the <a href="Free%20Syrian%20Army">Free Syrian Army</a> (FSA).

On February 2, 2014, al-Qaeda distanced itself from ISIS and its actions in Syria, but ISIS and the al-Qaeda-linked <a href="al-Nusra%20Front">al-Nusra Front</a> are still able to occasionally cooperate with each other when they fight against the Syrian government. The Saudi/Turkish-backed al-Nusra launched many attacks and <a href="List%20of%20bombings%20during%20the%20Syrian%20Civil%20War">bombings</a>, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government. In October 2015, <a href="Russian%20military%20intervention%20in%20the%20Syrian%20Civil%20War">Russian air strikes</a> targeted positions held by al-Nusra Front. In early 2016, a leading ISIL ideologue described al-Qaeda as the "Jews of jihad".

In September 2014 al-Zawahiri announced al-Qaeda was establishing a front in India to "wage jihad against its enemies, to liberate its land, to restore its sovereignty, and to revive its Caliphate." He nominated India as a beachhead for regional jihad taking in neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Bangladesh. The motivation for the video was questioned in some quarters where it was seen the militant group was struggling to remain relevant in light of the emerging prominence of ISIS. Reaction amongst Muslims in India to the formation of the new wing, to be known as "Qaedat al-Jihad fi'shibhi al-qarrat al-Hindiya" or al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent [AQIS], was one of fury. Leaders of several Indian Muslim organizations rejected al-Zawahiri's pronouncement, saying they could see no good coming from it, and viewed it as a threat to Muslim youth in the country.

US intelligence analyst accused the Pakistan military of 'stage-managing' the terror outfit's latest advance into India. Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official for South Asia, also said that Pakistan should be warned that it will be placed on the list of <a href="State%20Sponsors%20of%20Terrorism">State Sponsors of Terrorism</a>. Riedel also said that "Zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in Pakistan, no doubt, and many Indians suspect the <a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">ISI</a> (Inter Services Intelligence) is helping to protect him," he wrote.

Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.

Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.

On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda's first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.

The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, <a href="Operation%20Restore%20Hope">Operation Restore Hope</a>. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed.

No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether, and they went on to Somalia as scheduled. However, two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured. Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda's members, <a href="Mamdouh%20Mahmud%20Salim">Mamdouh Mahmud Salim</a>, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by <a href="Ibn%20Taymiyyah">Ibn Taymiyyah</a>, a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.

In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in <a href="Manila">Manila</a> for the <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation</a>. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the <a href="U.S.%20Secret%20Service">U.S. Secret Service</a>. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.

On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda <a href="1998%20U.S.%20embassy%20bombings">bombed the U.S. embassies in East Africa</a>, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, a barrage of <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a>s launched by the U.S. military devastated an al-Qaeda base in <a href="Khost">Khost</a>, Afghanistan, but the network's capacity was unharmed. In late 1999/2000, Al-Qaeda planned <a href="2000%20millennium%20attack%20plots">attacks to coincide with the millennium</a>, masterminded by <a href="Abu%20Zubaydah">Abu Zubaydah</a> and involving <a href="Abu%20Qatada">Abu Qatada</a>, which would include the bombing Christian holy sites in Jordan, the bombing of <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a> by <a href="Ahmed%20Ressam">Ahmed Ressam</a>, and the bombing of the .

On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen <a href="USS%20Cole%20bombing">bombed</a> the <a href="Guided%20missile%20destroyer">missile destroyer</a> "<a href="USS%20Cole%20%28DDG-67%29">USS Cole</a>" in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself.

The September 11 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing 2,977 victims, including 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, and 55 military personnel. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> or the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a>. It was also the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941.

The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the <a href="Fataw%C4%81%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden%231998%20Fatwa">1998 "fatwa"</a> issued against the U.S. and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others. Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a> as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, <a href="Khalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>, and <a href="Hambali">Hambali</a> as the key planners and part of the political and military command.

Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001, praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement. Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims.

Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in "<a href="Palestinian%20National%20Authority">Palestine</a>, <a href="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>, <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and Iraq" and that Muslims should retain the "right to attack in reprisal." He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but "America's icons of military and economic power," despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning where most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating massive amount of human casualties.

Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack "might get out of hand".

Al-Qaeda is deemed a <a href="List%20of%20designated%20terrorist%20groups">designated terrorist group</a> by the following countries and international organizations:
 

In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the US government <a href="Authorization%20for%20Use%20of%20Military%20Force%20Against%20Terrorists">responded militarily</a>, and began to prepare its <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">armed forces</a> to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the US attacked, it offered Taliban leader <a href="Mohammed%20Omar">Mullah Omar</a> a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA's elite <a href="Special%20Activities%20Division">Special Activities Division</a> (SAD).

The <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> offered to turn over bin Laden to a <a href="neutral%20country">neutral country</a> for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> responded by saying: "We know he's guilty. Turn him over", and British Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> warned the Taliban regime: "Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power".

Soon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Afghan Northern Alliance</a> removed the Taliban government in the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">war in Afghanistan</a>.

As a result of the US using its <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> and providing <a href="close%20air%20support">air support</a> for the <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> <a href="infantry">ground forces</a>, both <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> and <a href="Derunta%20training%20camp">al-Qaeda training camps</a> were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the <a href="Tora%20Bora">Tora Bora</a> area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged <a href="Gardez">Gardez</a> region of the nation.
Again, under the cover of intense <a href="aerial%20bombing%20of%20cities">aerial bombardment</a>, US <a href="infantry">infantry</a> and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant <a href="Taliban%20insurgency">Taliban insurgency</a> remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda's top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.

Debate raged about the exact nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks, and after the US invasion began, the <a href="United%20States%20State%20Department">US State Department</a> also released a <a href="Videos%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden%23December%2013%2C%202001">videotape</a> showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power. Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people, the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many <a href="television%20channels">television channels</a> all over the world, with an accompanying English translation provided by the <a href="U.S.%20Defense%20Department">U.S. Defense Department</a>.

In September 2004, the US government <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a> investigating the September 11 attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives. In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a <a href="2004%20Osama%20bin%20Laden%20video">videotape</a> released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 <a href="1982%20Lebanon%20War">invasion of Lebanon</a>: "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children."

By the end of 2004, the U.S. government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: <a href="Abu%20Zubaydah">Abu Zubaydah</a>, <a href="Ramzi%20bin%20al-Shibh">Ramzi bin al-Shibh</a> and <a href="Abd%20al-Rahim%20al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> in 2002; <a href="Khalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> in 2003; and <a href="Saif%20al%20Islam%20el%20Masry">Saif al Islam el Masry</a> in 2004. <a href="Mohammed%20Atef">Mohammed Atef</a> and several others were killed. The West was criticised for not being able to comprehend or deal with Al-Qaida despite more than a decade of the war. This also meant no progress has been made in global state security.

<a href="Al-Qaeda%20involvement%20in%20Africa">Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa</a> has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, as well as supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.

Islamist rebels in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> calling themselves <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb">al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb</a> have stepped up their violence in recent years. French officials say the rebels have no real links to the al-Qaeda leadership, but this is a matter of some dispute in the international press and amongst security analysts. It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group's name in late 2006, and the rebels "took on the al Qaeda franchise label", almost a year before the violence began to escalate.

In Mali, the <a href="Ansar%20Dine">Ansar Dine</a> faction was also reported as an ally of al-Qaeda in 2013. The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the <a href="Al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb">AQIM</a>.

Following the <a href="2011%20Libyan%20Civil%20War">Libyan Civil War</a>, the removal of <a href="Gaddafi">Gaddafi</a> and the ensuing period of <a href="post-civil%20war%20violence%20in%20Libya">post-civil war violence in Libya</a> allowed various <a href="Islamist">Islamist</a> militant groups affiliated with al-Qaeda to expand their operations in the region. The <a href="2012%20Benghazi%20attack">2012 Benghazi attack</a>, which resulted in the death of <a href="US%20Ambassador">US Ambassador</a> <a href="J.%20Christopher%20Stevens">J. Christopher Stevens</a> and 3 other Americans, is suspected of having been carried out by various <a href="Jihadist">Jihadist</a> networks, such as <a href="Al-Qaeda%20in%20the%20Islamic%20Maghreb">Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb</a>, <a href="Ansar%20al-Sharia">Ansar al-Sharia</a> and several other Al-Qaeda affiliated groups. The capture of <a href="Nazih%20Abdul-Hamed%20al-Ruqai">Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai</a>, a senior al-Qaeda operative wanted by the United States for his involvement in the <a href="1998%20United%20States%20embassy%20bombings">1998 United States embassy bombings</a>, on October 5, 2013, by <a href="U.S.%20Navy%20Seals">US Navy Seals</a>, <a href="FBI">FBI</a> and <a href="CIA">CIA</a> agents illustrates the importance the US and other Western allies have placed on North Africa.

Prior to the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, <a href="Al%20Qaeda%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">al-Qaeda</a> was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly former veterans of the <a href="Bosnian%20mujahideen">El Mudžahid</a> detachment of the Bosnian Muslim <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>. Three members of al-Qaeda carried out the <a href="Mostar%20car%20bombing">Mostar car bombing</a> in 1997. They were closely linked to and financed by the <a href="Saudi%20High%20Commission%20for%20Relief%20of%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> founded by then-prince King <a href="Salman%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">Salman of Saudi Arabia</a>.

Before the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, recruits at al-Qaeda training camps who had Western backgrounds were especially sought after by al-Qaeda's military wing for conducting operations overseas. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with <a href="Mohamed%20Atta">Mohamed Atta</a>, an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the <a href="Hamburg%20Cell">Hamburg Cell</a>. <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and <a href="Mohammed%20Atef">Mohammed Atef</a> would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the <a href="9/11%20hijackers">9/11 hijackers</a>. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.

In 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.

In 2009, three Londoners, Tanvir Hussain, Assad Sarwar and Ahmed Abdullah Ali, were convicted of <a href="2006%20transatlantic%20aircraft%20plot">conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for Canada and the U.S.</a> The massively complex police and <a href="MI5">MI5</a> investigation of the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers. British and U.S. officials said the plot – unlike many similar homegrown European Islamic militant plots – was directly linked to al-Qaeda and guided by senior al-Qaeda members in Pakistan.

In 2012, Russian Intelligence indicated that al-Qaeda had given a call for "forest jihad" and has been starting massive forest fires as part of a strategy of "thousand cuts".

Following <a href="Yemeni%20unification">Yemeni unification</a> in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country in an effort to subvert the capitalist north. Although it is unlikely that bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the <a href="USS%20Cole%20bombing">USS "Cole" bombing</a>. Concerns grow over Al Qaeda's group in <a href="Yemeni%20al-Qaeda%20crackdown">Yemen</a>.

In Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the <a href="Jama%27at%20al-Tawhid%20wal-Jihad">Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad</a> group commanded by <a href="Abu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>. Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a "key driver" of the <a href="Iraqi%20insurgency%20%28Iraq%20War%29">Sunni insurgency</a>. Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi's group. Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa'qaa munitions factory in <a href="Yusufiyah">Yusufiyah</a> have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida. In November 2010, the militant group <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq">Islamic State of Iraq</a> , which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to "exterminate all <a href="Iraqi%20Christians">Iraqi Christians</a>".

Significantly, it was not until the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began training <a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as <a href="Hamas">Hamas</a> and <a href="Palestinian%20Islamic%20Jihad">Palestinian Islamic Jihad</a> – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.

, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are openly supporting the <a href="Army%20of%20Conquest">Army of Conquest</a>, an umbrella rebel group fighting in the <a href="Syrian%20Civil%20War">Syrian Civil War</a> against the Syrian government that reportedly includes an al-Qaeda linked <a href="al-Nusra%20Front">al-Nusra Front</a> and another <a href="Salafi%20jihadism">Salafi</a> coalition known as <a href="Ahrar%20al-Sham">Ahrar al-Sham</a>.

Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of the 'Crusader-Zionist-Hindu' conspiracy against the Islamic world. According to the 2005 report 'Al Qaeda: Profile and Threat Assessment' by <a href="Congressional%20Research%20Service">Congressional Research Service</a>, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early nineties. By 2001, Kashmiri militant group <a href="Harkat-ul-Mujahideen">Harkat-ul-Mujahideen</a> had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition. According to the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (in <a href="Azad%20Kashmir">Azad Kashmir</a>, and to some extent in <a href="Gilgit%E2%80%93Baltistan">Gilgit–Baltistan</a>) during the 1999 <a href="Kargil%20War">Kargil War</a> and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan's Intelligence services.

Many of the militants active in Kashmir were trained in the same <a href="Madrasah">Madrasah</a>s as <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> and al-Qaeda. <a href="Fazlur%20Rehman%20Khalil">Fazlur Rehman Khalil</a> of Kashmiri militant group <a href="Harkat-ul-Mujahideen">Harkat-ul-Mujahideen</a> was a signatory of al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of <a href="Jihad">Jihad</a> against America and its allies. In a 'Letter to American People' written by bin Laden in 2002 he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support to India on the Kashmir issue. In November 2001, <a href="Kathmandu">Kathmandu</a> airport went on high alert after threats that bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi. In 2002, US Secretary of Defense <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, on a trip to Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence. He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.
An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency <a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">Inter-Services Intelligence</a> In 2002, a special team of <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> and <a href="Delta%20Force">Delta Force</a> was sent into <a href="Indian%20Administered%20Kashmir">Indian Administered Kashmir</a> to hunt for bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by Kashmiri militant group <a href="Harkat-ul-Mujahideen">Harkat-ul-Mujahideen</a> which had previously been responsible for <a href="1995%20Kidnapping%20of%20western%20tourists%20in%20Kashmir">1995 Kidnapping of western tourists in Kashmir</a>. Britain's highest ranking al-Qaeda operative <a href="Rangzieb%20Ahmed">Rangzieb Ahmed</a> had previously fought in Kashmir with the group <a href="Harkat-ul-Mujahideen">Harkat-ul-Mujahideen</a> and spent time in Indian prison after being captured in Kashmir.

US officials believe that al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan. In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this has worried the Indian government. However the Indian Army Lt. Gen. H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, said to reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>; furthermore he said that there is nothing that can verify reports from the media of al-Qaeda presence in the state. He however stated that al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups <a href="Lashkar-e-Taiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> and <a href="Jaish-e-Mohammed">Jaish-e-Mohammed</a> based in Pakistan. It has been noted that <a href="Waziristan">Waziristan</a> has now become the new battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban. <a href="Dhiren%20Barot">Dhiren Barot</a>, who wrote the "Army of Madinah in Kashmir" and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the <a href="2004%20financial%20buildings%20plot">2004 financial buildings plot</a>, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir.

<a href="Maulana%20Masood%20Azhar">Maulana Masood Azhar</a>, the founder of another Kashmiri group <a href="Jaish-e-Mohammed">Jaish-e-Mohammed</a>, is believed to have met bin Laden several times and received funding from him. In 2002, <a href="Jaish-e-Mohammed">Jaish-e-Mohammed</a> organized the kidnapping and murder of <a href="Daniel%20Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a> in an operation run in conjunction with al-Qaeda and funded by bin Laden. According to American <a href="counter-terrorism">counter-terrorism</a> expert <a href="Bruce%20Riedel">Bruce Riedel</a>, al-Qaeda and Taliban were closely involved in the 1999 hijacking of <a href="Indian%20Airlines%20Flight%20814">Indian Airlines Flight 814</a> to <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> which led to the release of <a href="Maulana%20Masood%20Azhar">Maulana Masood Azhar</a> and <a href="Ahmed%20Omar%20Saeed%20Sheikh">Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh</a> from an Indian prison in exchange for the passengers. This hijacking, Riedel stated, was rightly described by then Indian Foreign minister <a href="Jaswant%20Singh">Jaswant Singh</a> as a 'dress rehearsal' for September 11 attacks. Bin Laden personally welcomed Azhar and threw a lavish party in his honor after his release, according to <a href="Abu%20Jandal">Abu Jandal</a>, bodyguard of bin Laden. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been in Indian prison for his role in <a href="1994%20kidnappings%20of%20Western%20tourists%20in%20India">1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India</a>, went on to murder <a href="Daniel%20Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a> and was sentenced to death by Pakistan. Al-Qaeda operative <a href="Rashid%20Rauf">Rashid Rauf</a>, who was one of the accused in <a href="2006%20transatlantic%20aircraft%20plot">2006 transatlantic aircraft plot</a>, was related to Maulana Masood Azhar by marriage.

<a href="Lashkar-e-Taiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a>, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind <a href="2008%20Mumbai%20attacks">2008 Mumbai attacks</a>, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan. In Late 2002, top al-Qaeda operative <a href="Abu%20Zubaydah">Abu Zubaydah</a> was arrested while being sheltered by <a href="Lashkar-e-Taiba">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> in a safe house in <a href="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>. The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been 'intertwined' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba. French investigating magistrate <a href="Jean-Louis%20Brugui%C3%A8re">Jean-Louis Bruguière</a>, who was the top French counter-terrorism official, told Reuters in 2009 that 'Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda.'

In a video released in 2008, senior al-Qaeda operative American-born <a href="Adam%20Yahiye%20Gadahn">Adam Yahiye Gadahn</a> stated that "victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land."

In September 2009, a US <a href="Drone%20attacks%20in%20Pakistan">drone strike</a> reportedly killed <a href="Ilyas%20Kashmiri">Ilyas Kashmiri</a> who was the chief of <a href="Harkat-ul-Jihad%20al-Islami">Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami</a>, a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda. Kashmiri was described by <a href="Bruce%20Riedel">Bruce Riedel</a> as a 'prominent' al-Qaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda. Kashmiri was also charged by the US in a plot against <a href="Jyllands-Posten">Jyllands-Posten</a>, the Danish newspaper which was at the center of <a href="Jyllands-Posten%20Muhammad%20cartoons%20controversy">Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy</a>. US officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the <a href="Camp%20Chapman%20attack">Camp Chapman attack</a> against the CIA. In January 2010, Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city. This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja, an operative of <a href="Harkat-ul-Jihad%20al-Islami">Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami</a>, who had been arrested in India.

In January 2010, US Defense secretary <a href="Robert%20Gates">Robert Gates</a>, while on a visit to Pakistan, stated that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

Timothy L. Thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. As a result, the group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering and sharing.

<a href="Abu%20Ayyub%20al-Masri">Abu Ayyub al-Masri</a>'s al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of <a href="Abu%20Musab%20al-Zarqawi">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> (the former leader of <a href="al-Qaeda%20in%20Iraq">al-Qaeda in Iraq</a>), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the <a href="Mujahideen%20Shura%20Council%20%28Iraq%29">Mujahideen Shura Council</a>, has a regular <a href="web%20presence">presence on the Web</a>.

The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur <a href="Nick%20Berg">Nick Berg</a> being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28hostage%29">Paul Johnson</a>, <a href="Kim%20Sun-il">Kim Sun-il</a>, and <a href="Daniel%20Pearl">Daniel Pearl</a>, were first posted on jihadist websites.

In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to <a href="Aljazeera">al Jazeera</a> as he had done in the past.

Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the <a href="Saudi%20royal%20family">Saudi royal family</a>. Bin Laden's December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.

In the past, <a href="Alneda">Alneda</a>.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.

The US charged a British information technology specialist, <a href="Babar%20Ahmad">Babar Ahmad</a>, on terrorism charges related to his operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com. He was convicted and sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in prison.

In 2007, al-Qaeda released <a href="Mujahedeen%20Secrets">Mujahedeen Secrets</a>, encryption software used for online and cellular communications. A later version, <a href="Mujahideen%20Secrets%202">Mujahideen Secrets 2</a>, was released in 2008.

Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including "several <a href="Boeing%20727">Boeing 727</a> aircraft", <a href="turboprops">turboprops</a> and <a href="executive%20jet">executive jet</a>s, according to a 2010 <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> story. Based on a U.S. <a href="Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly <a href="kidnapping">kidnapping</a> some Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.

The following is a list of military conflicts in which Al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken part militarily.
 Experts debate whether or not the al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect result from the American CIA's "<a href="Operation%20Cyclone">Operation Cyclone</a>" program to help the Afghan <a href="Islamic%20mujahid%20movement">mujahideen</a>. <a href="Robin%20Cook">Robin Cook</a>, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies", and that "Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians."

<a href="Munir%20Akram">Munir Akram</a>, <a href="Permanent%20Representative%20of%20Pakistan%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations</a> from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" on January 19, 2008:
The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.

A variety of sources – <a href="CNN">CNN</a> journalist <a href="Peter%20Bergen">Peter Bergen</a>, <a href="Inter-Services%20Intelligence">Pakistani ISI</a> Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as <a href="Vincent%20Cannistraro">Vincent Cannistraro</a> – deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.

Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight; that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.

According to Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that "the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."

English journalist <a href="Jason%20Burke">Jason Burke</a> wrote:

<a href="Anders%20Behring%20Breivik">Anders Behring Breivik</a>, the perpetrator of the <a href="2011%20Norway%20attacks">2011 Norway attacks</a>, was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it "the most successful revolutionary movement in the world." While admitting different aims, he sought to "create a European version of al-Qaida."

Extremism within Islam goes back to the <a href="Kharijites">Kharijites</a> of the 7th century. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to <a href="Takfir">Takfir</a>, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.

According to a number of sources, a "wave of revulsion" has been expressed against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by "religious scholars, former fighters and militants" who are alarmed by al-Qaeda's <a href="takfir">takfir</a> and its killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially in Iraq.

<a href="Noman%20Benotman">Noman Benotman</a>, a former Afghan Arab and a militant member of the <a href="Libyan%20Islamic%20Fighting%20Group">Libyan Islamic Fighting Group</a>, went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007 after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months later after "they were said to have renounced violence."

In 2007, around the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and a couple of months before "Rationalizing Jihad" first appeared in the newspapers, the Saudi sheikh <a href="Salman%20al-Ouda">Salman al-Ouda</a> delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism. Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him
My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?

According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda has been slightly dropped for parts of the Muslim world in the years before 2008. The numbers supporting suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, for instance, have dropped by half or more in the last five years. In Saudi Arabia, only 10 percent now have a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>.

In 2007, the imprisoned <a href="Sayyed%20Imam%20Al-Sharif">Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif</a>, an influential Afghan Arab, "ideological godfather of al-Qaeda", and former supporter of takfir, sensationally withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book "<a href="Sayyed%20Imam%20Al-Sharif%23Rationalizing%20Jihad%20in%20Egypt%20and%20the%20World">Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam</a>" ("Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World").

Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 <a href="Libyan%20Islamic%20Fighting%20Group">LIFG</a> completed a new "code" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled "Corrective Studies". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's about face may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment.

Alessandro Volta

Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (; 18 February 1745 – 5 March 1827) was an <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> <a href="physicist">physicist</a>, <a href="chemist">chemist</a>, and a pioneer of <a href="electricity">electricity</a> and <a href="Power%20%28physics%29">power</a>, who is credited as the inventor of the <a href="electrical%20battery">electrical battery</a> and the discoverer of <a href="methane">methane</a>. He invented the <a href="Voltaic%20pile">Voltaic pile</a> in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in 1800 in a two-part letter to the President of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. With this invention Volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings. Volta's invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments which eventually led to the development of the field of <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>.

Alessandro Volta also drew admiration from <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> for his invention, and was invited to the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institute of France</a> to demonstrate his invention to the members of the Institute. Volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the Emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him. Alessandro Volta held the chair of experimental physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Pavia">University of Pavia</a> for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students.

Despite his professional success, Volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years. At this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823. The <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI</a> unit of <a href="electric%20potential">electric potential</a> is named in his honour as the <a href="volt">volt</a>.

Volta was born in <a href="Como">Como</a>, a town in present-day northern <a href="Italy">Italy</a> (near the <a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> border), on 18 February 1745. In 1794, Volta married an aristocratic lady also from Como, Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons: Zanino, Flaminio, and Luigi. His father, Filippo Volta, was of noble lineage. His mother, Donna Maddalena, came from the family of the Inzaghis.

In 1774, he became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the <a href="electrophorus">electrophorus</a>, a device that produced <a href="static%20electricity">static electricity</a>. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter <a href="Johan%20Wilcke">Johan Wilcke</a>. In 1777, he travelled through Switzerland. There he befriended <a href="H.%20B.%20de%20Saussure">H. B. de Saussure</a>.

In the years between 1776 and 1778, Volta studied the <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> of gases. He researched and discovered <a href="methane">methane</a> after reading a paper by <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> of the United States on "flammable air". In November 1776, he found methane at <a href="Lake%20Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a>, and by 1778 he managed to isolate methane. He devised experiments such as the <a href="combustion">ignition</a> of methane by an electric <a href="Electrostatic%20discharge">spark</a> in a closed vessel.

Volta also studied what we now call electrical <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a>, developing separate means to study both electrical potential ("V" ) and charge ("Q" ), and discovering that for a given object, they are proportional. This is called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and it was for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the <a href="volt">volt</a>.

In 1779 he became a professor of experimental physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Pavia">University of Pavia</a>, a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years.

<a href="Luigi%20Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a>, an Italian physicist, discovered something he named "animal electricity" when two different metals were connected in series with a frog's leg and to one another. Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.

In this way he discovered the <a href="electrochemical%20series">electrochemical series</a>, and the law that the <a href="electromotive%20force">electromotive force</a> (emf) of a <a href="galvanic%20cell">galvanic cell</a>, consisting of a pair of metal <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf). This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series.

In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the <a href="voltaic%20pile">voltaic pile</a>, an early <a href="Battery%20%28electricity%29">electric battery</a>, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="copper">copper</a>. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with <a href="brine">brine</a> into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.

In announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of <a href="William%20Nicholson%20%28chemist%29">William Nicholson</a>, <a href="Tiberius%20Cavallo">Tiberius Cavallo</a>, and <a href="Abraham%20Bennet">Abraham Bennet</a>.

The battery made by Volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells. It consists of two electrodes: one made of <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, the other of <a href="copper">copper</a>. The <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> is either <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> mixed with water or a form of saltwater <a href="brine">brine</a>. The electrolyte exists in the form 2H and SO. The zinc, which is higher in the <a href="standard%20electrode%20potential%20%28data%20page%29">electrochemical series</a> than both copper and hydrogen, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO). The positively charged hydrogen ions (<a href="proton">proton</a>s) capture <a href="electron">electron</a>s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode.

Thus, there are two terminals, and an <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> will flow if they are connected. The <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s in this voltaic cell are as follows:

The copper does not react, but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current.

However, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released. Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.

In 1809 Volta became associated member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Institute of the Netherlands</a>. In honour of his work, Volta was made a count by <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1810.

Volta retired in 1819 to his estate in Camnago, a <a href="frazione">frazione</a> of <a href="Como%2C%20Italy">Como, Italy</a>, now named "Camnago Volta" in his honour. He died there on 5 March 1827, just after his 82nd birthday. Volta's remains were buried in Camnago Volta.

Volta's legacy is celebrated by the <a href="Tempio%20Voltiano">Tempio Voltiano</a> memorial located in the public gardens by the lake. There is also a museum which has been built in his honour, which exhibits some of the equipment that Volta used to conduct experiments. Nearby stands the <a href="Villa%20Olmo">Villa Olmo</a>, which houses the Voltian Foundation, an organization promoting scientific activities. Volta carried out his experimental studies and produced his first inventions near Como.

His image was depicted on the <a href="Italian%20lira">Italian 10,000 lira note</a> (1990-1997) along with a sketch of his voltaic pile.

Volta was raised as a Catholic and for all of his life continued to maintain his belief. Because he was not ordained a clergyman as his family expected, he was sometimes accused of being irreligious and some people have speculated about his possible unbelief, stressing that "he did not join the Church", or that he virtually "ignored the church's call". Nevertheless, he cast out doubts in a declaration of faith in which he said:

I do not understand how anyone can doubt the sincerity and constancy of my attachment to the religion which I profess, the Roman, Catholic and Apostolic religion in which I was born and brought up, and of which I have always made confession, externally and internally. I have, indeed, and only too often, failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian, and I have been guilty of many sins: but through the special mercy of God I have never, as far as I know, wavered in my faith... In this faith I recognise a pure gift of God, a supernatural grace; but I have not neglected those human means which confirm belief, and overthrow the doubts which at times arise. I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion, the works of apologists and assailants, the reasons for and against, and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability, even for the merely natural reason, that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion, every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it. May this confession which has been asked from me and which I willingly give, written and subscribed by my own hand, with authority to show it to whomsoever you will, for I am not ashamed of the Gospel, may it produce some good fruit!

Argo Navis

Argo Navis (the Ship Argo), or simply Argo, was a large <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern sky</a> that has since been divided into the three constellations of <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>, <a href="Puppis%20%28constellation%29">Puppis</a> and <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a>. The genitive was "Argus Navis", abbreviated "Arg". <a href="John%20Flamsteed">Flamsteed</a> and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just Navis (the Ship), genitive "Navis", abbreviated "Nav". 

It was identified in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> with the "<a href="Argo">Argo</a>", the ship used by <a href="Jason">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a> that sailed to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece. The original constellation is presently found near the southern horizon of the Mediterranean sky, becoming visible in springtime and sailed westward, skimming along the southern horizon. Due to <a href="precession">precession of the equinoxes</a>, many of the stars of Argo have been shifted farther south since Classical times, and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitudes of the Mediterranean. This includes its brightest 1st-magnitude star, <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a> or α Carinae. All the stars of Argo Navis are easily visible south of the equator, and pass near zenith from southern temperate latitudes.

Argo Navis is the only one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> that is no longer officially recognized as a constellation. It was unwieldy due to its enormous size. In his "Coelum Australe Stelliferum", published in 1763, the French astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> explained that there were more than a hundred and sixty stars clearly visible to the naked eye in Navis, and so he used the set of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters three times on portions of the constellation referred to as "Argûs in carina" (<a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>, the <a href="keel">keel</a> or hull), "Argûs in puppi" (<a href="Puppis%20%28constellation%29">Puppis</a>, the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a> or <a href="stern">stern</a>), and "Argûs in velis" (<a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a>, the <a href="sail">sail</a>s). Lacaille replaced Bayer's <a href="Bayer%20designation">designations</a> with new ones that followed stellar magnitudes more closely, but used only a single Greek-letter sequence and described the constellation for those stars as "Argûs". Similarly, faint non-lettered stars were listed only as in "Argûs".

The final breakup and abolition of Argo Navis was proposed by <a href="Sir%20John%20Herschel">Sir John Herschel</a> in 1841 and again in 1844, but it was not formalised until 1930 when the IAU defined the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>. Lacaille's designations were kept in the three separate constellations, so Carina has α, β and ε, Vela has γ and δ, Puppis has ζ, and so on.

The constellation <a href="Pyxis">Pyxis</a> (the <a href="mariner%27s%20compass">mariner's compass</a>) occupies an area which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast. Some authors state that Pyxis was part of the Greek conception of Argo Navis, but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient Greek times. Lacaille considered it a separate constellation, representing one of the modern scientific instruments he placed among the constellations (like <a href="Microscopium">Microscopium</a> and <a href="Telescopium">Telescopium</a>). Pyxis was listed separately, among his 14 new constellations. Lacaille assigned Bayer designations to Pyxis separate from those of Argo, and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of the ship. In 1844, John Herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation, <a href="Malus%20%28constellation%29">Malus</a>, to replace Lacaille's Pyxis, but the idea did not catch on.

The <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> had several names for what was the constellation Argo, including "Te Waka-o-Tamarereti", "Te Kohi-a-Autahi", and "Te Kohi".

Andromeda (mythology)

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Andromeda is the daughter of the <a href="Aethiopia">Aethiopia</a>n king <a href="Cepheus%2C%20King%20of%20Aethiopia">Cepheus</a> and his wife <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28Queen%20of%20Ethiopia%29">Cassiopeia</a>. When Cassiopeia's <a href="hubris">hubris</a> leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the <a href="Nereids">Nereids</a>, <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> sends the <a href="sea%20monster">sea monster</a> <a href="Cetus%20%28mythology%29">Cetus</a> to ravage Aethiopia as divine punishment. Andromeda is stripped and chained naked to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a>.

Her name is the <a href="Latin%20language">Latinized</a> form of the Greek ("Androméda") or ("Andromédē"): "ruler of men", from ("anēr, andrós") "man", and "medon", "ruler".

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a <a href="Greek%20hero">Greek hero</a>'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic "<a href="hieros%20gamos">hieros gamos</a>" (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "<a href="princess%20and%20dragon">princess and dragon</a>" <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a>. From the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s account.

In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of the North African kingdom of <a href="Aethiopia%20%28Classical%20Greek%20term%29">Aethiopia</a>.

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the <a href="Nereids">Nereids</a>, the <a href="nymph">nymph</a>-daughters of the sea god <a href="Nereus">Nereus</a> and often seen accompanying <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>. To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named <a href="Cetus%20%28mythology%29">Cetus</a> to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the <a href="Oracle">Oracle</a> of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.

<a href="Perseus">Perseus</a> was returning from having slain the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a>, <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing <a href="Cap%20of%20invisibility%23Origins">Hades's helm</a>), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle <a href="Phineus%20%28son%20of%20Belus%29">Phineus</a>. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.

Andromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of <a href="Serifos">Serifos</a>, where he rescued his mother <a href="Dana%C3%AB">Danaë</a>, and then to <a href="Tiryns">Tiryns</a> in <a href="Argos">Argos</a>. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the "Perseidae" through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: <a href="Perses%20%28son%20of%20Andromeda%20and%20Perseus%29">Perses</a>, <a href="Alcaeus%20%28mythology%29">Alcaeus</a>, <a href="Heleus">Heleus</a>, <a href="Mestor">Mestor</a>, <a href="Sthenelus%20%28son%20of%20Andromeda%20and%20Perseus%29">Sthenelus</a>, <a href="Electryon">Electryon</a>, and <a href="Cynurus">Cynurus</a> as well as two daughters, <a href="Autochthe">Autochthe</a> and <a href="Gorgophone%20%28Perseid%29">Gorgophone</a>. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from <a href="Electryon">Electryon</a> down to <a href="Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a>, after whom <a href="Atreus">Atreus</a> attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a>.

At the port city of <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> (today part of <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, the geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> and the historian of the Jews <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>.

After Andromeda's death, as <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> had promised <a href="Athena">Athena</a> at the end of his "<a href="Andromeda%20%28play%29">Andromeda</a>", produced in 412 BCE, the goddess placed her among the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s in the northern sky, near Perseus and <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a>; the <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">constellation Andromeda</a>, so known since antiquity, is named after her.

Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Andromeda%20%28constellation%29">Andromeda</a>, which contains the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>.

The advancement of science and technology allowed the emergence of astrophotography which allowed more concrete observation of the Andromeda constellation and led to the discovery that the galaxy lies within the Andromeda constellation.

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:


Other constellations related to the story are:

<a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> (and in more modern times, <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Corneille</a>) made the story the subject of <a href="tragedies">tragedies</a>, and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art, including Greek vases. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Jean-Baptiste Lully</a>'s opera, "<a href="Pers%C3%A9e">Persée</a>", also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of <a href="Titian">Titian</a>'s "poesies" (<a href="Wallace%20Collection">Wallace Collection</a>), and compositions by <a href="Joachim%20Wtewael">Joachim Wtewael</a> (<a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Louvre</a>), <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Veronese</a> (Rennes), <a href="Perseus%20and%20Andromeda%20%28Rubens%29">many versions by Rubens</a>, <a href="Ingres">Ingres</a>, and <a href="Gustave%20Moreau">Gustave Moreau</a>. From the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest. <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>'s "<a href="Andromeda%20Chained%20to%20the%20Rocks">Andromeda Chained to the Rocks</a>" is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

The Italian composer <a href="Salvatore%20Sciarrino">Salvatore Sciarrino</a> composed an hour-long operatic drama called "Perseo e Andromeda" in 2000.

Antlia

Antlia (; from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ἀντλία") is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Its name means "<a href="pump">pump</a>" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>; it represents an <a href="air%20pump">air pump</a>. Originally Antlia Pneumatica, the constellation was established by <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> in the 18th century, though its name was later abbreviated by <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>. Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>, Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49 degrees north</a>.

Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is <a href="Alpha%20Antliae">Alpha Antliae</a>, an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> that is a suspected <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>, ranging between <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s 4.22 and 4.29. <a href="S%20Antliae">S Antliae</a> is an <a href="Binary%20star%23Eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary</a> star system, changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other. Sharing a <a href="common%20envelope">common envelope</a>, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, <a href="HD%2093083">HD 93083</a> and <a href="WASP-66">WASP-66</a>, lie within Antlia, as do <a href="NGC%202997">NGC 2997</a>, a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>, and the <a href="Antlia%20Dwarf">Antlia Dwarf Galaxy</a>.

The French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> first described the constellation in French as "la Machine Pneumatique" (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the <a href="air%20pump">air pump</a> invented by the French physicist <a href="Denis%20Papin">Denis Papin</a>. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer <a href="Johann%20Elert%20Bode">Johann Bode</a> chose the more advanced double-cylinder version. Lacaille <a href="Latin">Latin</a>ised the name to "Antlia pneumatica" on his 1763 chart. English astronomer <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> adopted it as one of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> in 1922.

Although above the horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been included in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.

Chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes, and incorporated its stars into two different constellations. Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of ""Dong'ou"", which represented an area in southern China. Furthermore, <a href="Epsilon%20Antliae">Epsilon</a>, <a href="Eta%20Antliae">Eta</a>, and <a href="Theta%20Antliae">Theta Antliae</a> were incorporated into the celestial temple, which also contained stars from modern <a href="Pyxis">Pyxis</a>.

Covering 238.9 square degrees and hence 0.579% of the sky, Antlia ranks 62nd of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole <a href="constellation">constellation</a> is visible to observers south of <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49°N</a>. <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a> the sea snake runs along the length of its northern border, while <a href="Pyxis">Pyxis</a> the compass, <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a> the sails, and <a href="Centaurus">Centaurus</a> the centaur line it to the west, south and east respectively. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union, is Ant. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of twelve segments ("illustrated in infobox at top-right"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −24.54° and −40.42°.

Lacaille gave nine stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, including two stars next to each other as Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, <a href="Iota%20Antliae">Iota Antliae</a>. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now <a href="HR%204339">HR 4339</a> and <a href="HD%2090156">HD 90156</a>) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.

The constellation's two brightest stars—<a href="Alpha%20Antliae">Alpha</a> and <a href="Epsilon%20Antliae">Epsilon Antliae</a>—shine with a reddish tinge. Alpha is an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20K">K4III</a> that is a suspected <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>, ranging between <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and on its way to becoming a <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a> star, having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 times that of the Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. At the other end of Antlia, <a href="Iota%20Antliae">Iota Antliae</a> is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III.
Located near Alpha is <a href="Delta%20Antliae">Delta Antliae</a>, a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, 430 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. The primary is a <a href="B-type%20main%20sequence%20star">blue-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20B">B9.5V</a> and magnitude 5.6, and the secondary is a <a href="F-type%20main%20sequence%20star">yellow-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20F">F9Ve</a> and magnitude 9.6. <a href="Zeta%20Antliae">Zeta Antliae</a> is a wide optical <a href="double%20star">double star</a>. The brighter star—<a href="Zeta1%20Antliae">Zeta Antliae</a>—is 410 ± 40 light-years distant and has a magnitude of 5.74, though it is a true binary star system composed of two <a href="A-type%20main%20sequence%20star">white main sequence stars</a> of magnitudes 6.20 and 7.01 that are separated by 8.042 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s.

Ara (constellation)

Ara (Latin: "The Altar") is a southern <a href="constellation">constellation</a> situated between <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a> and <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a>. Ara (Greek: Βωμός) was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>.

The orange supergiant <a href="Beta%20Arae">Beta Arae</a> is the brightest star in the constellation, with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 2.85—marginally brighter than the blue-white <a href="Alpha%20Arae">Alpha Arae</a>. Seven star systems host planets. The sunlike star <a href="Mu%20Arae">Mu Arae</a> hosts four planets, while <a href="Gliese%20676">Gliese 676</a> is a binary red dwarf system with four planets. The Milky Way crosses the northwestern part of Ara.

In ancient <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>. The nearby <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar, 

Ara is one of the southernmost constellations depicted by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. It had been recorded by <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a> in 270 BCE as lying close to the horizon, and the <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a> portrays stars as far south as <a href="Gamma%20Arae">Gamma Arae</a>. Professor of astronomy <a href="Bradley%20Schaefer">Bradley Schaefer</a> has proposed that ancient observers must have been able to see as far south as <a href="Zeta%20Arae">Zeta Arae</a> to define a pattern that looked like an altar.
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as an <a href="altar">altar</a> with its smoke 'rising' southward. However, depictions of Ara often vary in their details. In the early days of printing, a 1482 <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> of <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Gaius Julius Hyginus</a>'s classic "Poeticon Astronomicon" depicts the altar as surrounded by demons. <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense; the flames rise southward as in most atlases. <a href="Hyginus">Hyginus</a> also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, <a href="Willem%20Blaeu">Willem Blaeu</a>, a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering. Unlike most depictions, the smoke from Blaeu's Ara rises northward, represented by <a href="Alpha%20Arae">Alpha Arae</a>.

In <a href="Ara%20%28Chinese%20astronomy%29">Chinese astronomy</a>, the stars of the constellation Ara lie within "<a href="Azure%20Dragon">The Azure Dragon of the East</a>" (東方青龍, "Dōng Fāng Qīng Lóng"). Five stars of Ara formed Guī (龜), a <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a>, while another three formed Chǔ (杵), a <a href="pestle">pestle</a>.

Covering 237.1 square degrees and hence 0.575% of the sky, Ara ranks 63rd of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole <a href="constellation">constellation</a> is visible to observers south of <a href="22nd%20parallel%20north">22°N</a>. <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a> runs along the length of its northern border, while <a href="Norma%20%28constellation%29">Norma</a> and <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a> border it to the west, <a href="Apus">Apus</a> to the south, and <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> and <a href="Telescopium">Telescopium</a> to the east respectively. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union, is Ara. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of twelve segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −45.49° and −67.69°.

Bayer gave eight stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, though he had never seen the constellation directly as it never rises above the horizon in Germany. After charting the southern constellations, Lacaille recharted the stars of Ara from Alpha though to Sigma, including three pairs of stars next to each other as Epsilon, Kappa and Nu. 

Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a> and thus has rich star fields. Within the constellation's borders, there are 71 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.

Just shading Alpha Arae, <a href="Beta%20Arae">Beta Arae</a> is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange-hued star of spectral type K3Ib-IIa that has been classified as a supergiant or bright giant, that is around 650 light-years from Earth. It is around 8.21 times as massive and 5,636 times as luminous as the Sun. At <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 2.85, this difference in brightness between the two is undetectable by the unaided eye. 

<a href="Alpha%20Arae">Alpha Arae</a> is a <a href="B-type%20main%20sequence%20star">blue-white main sequence star</a> of magnitude 2.95, that is 270 ± 20 light-years from Earth. This star is around 9.6 times as massive as the Sun, and has an average of 4.5 times its radius. It is 5,800 times as luminous as the Sun, its energy emitted from its <a href="stellar%20atmosphere">outer envelope</a> at an <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> of 18,044 K. A <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a>, Alpha Arae is surrounded by a dense equatorial disk of material in Keplerian (rather than uniform) rotation. The star is losing mass by a polar <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> with a terminal velocity of approximately 1,000 km/s.

At magnitude 3.13 is <a href="Zeta%20Arae">Zeta Arae</a>, an orange giant of spectral type K3III that is located 490 ± 10 light-years from Earth. Around 7–8 times as massive as the Sun, it has swollen to a diameter around 114 times that of the Sun and is 3800 times as luminous.

Close to Beta Arae is <a href="Gamma%20Arae">Gamma Arae</a>, a blue-hued supergiant of spectral type B1Ib. Of apparent magnitude 3.3, it is 1110 ± 60 light-years from Earth. It has been estimated to be between 12.5 and 25 times as massive as the Sun, and have around 120,000 times its luminosity.

<a href="Delta%20Arae">Delta Arae</a> is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8Vn and magnitude 3.6, 198 ± 4 light-years from Earth. It is around 3.56 times as massive as the Sun.

<a href="Exoplanet">Exoplanet</a>s have been discovered in seven star systems in the constellation. <a href="Mu%20Arae">Mu Arae</a> is a sunlike star that hosts four planets. <a href="HD%20152079">HD 152079</a> is a sunlike star with a planet. <a href="HD%20154672">HD 154672</a> is an ageing sunlike star with a <a href="Hot%20Jupiter">Hot Jupiter</a>. <a href="HD%20154857">HD 154857</a> is a sunlike star with one confirmed and one suspected planet. <a href="HD%20156411">HD 156411</a> is a star hotter and larger than the sun with a gas giant planet in orbit. <a href="Gliese%20674">Gliese 674</a> is a nearby red dwarf star with a planet. <a href="Gliese%20676">Gliese 676</a> is a binary star system composed of two red dwarves with four planets.

The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> and contains several <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s (notably <a href="NGC%206200">NGC 6200</a>) and <a href="diffuse%20nebula">diffuse nebula</a>e (including the bright cluster/nebula pair <a href="NGC%206188">NGC 6188</a> and <a href="NGC%206193">NGC 6193</a>). The brightest of the <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s, sixth magnitude <a href="NGC%206397">NGC 6397</a>, lies at a distance of just , making it one of the closest globular clusters to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

Ara also contains <a href="Westerlund%201">Westerlund 1</a>, a <a href="super%20star%20cluster">super star cluster</a> that contains the red supergiant <a href="Westerlund%201-26">Westerlund 1-26</a>, one of the largest stars known.

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two <a href="spiral%20galaxies">spiral galaxies</a> (NGC 6215 and <a href="NGC%206221">NGC 6221</a>) are visible near star <a href="Eta%20Arae">Eta Arae</a>.

Arkansas (pronounced ) is a <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southeastern</a> region of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, home to over 3 million people as of 2017. Its name is of <a href="Siouan%20languages">Siouan</a> derivation from the language of the <a href="Osage%20%28tribe%29">Osage</a> denoting their related kin, the <a href="Quapaw">Quapaw</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a>. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the <a href="The%20Ozarks">Ozark</a> and the <a href="Ouachita%20Mountains">Ouachita Mountains</a>, which make up the <a href="U.S.%20Interior%20Highlands">U.S. Interior Highlands</a>, to the densely forested land in the south known as the <a href="Arkansas%20Timberlands">Arkansas Timberlands</a>, to the eastern lowlands along the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and the <a href="Arkansas%20Delta">Arkansas Delta</a>.

Arkansas is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">29th largest by area</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population">33rd most populous</a> of the <a href="50%20United%20States">50 United States</a>. The capital and most populous city is <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, located in the central portion of the state, a hub for transportation, business, culture, and government. The northwestern corner of the state, such as the <a href="Fayetteville%E2%80%93Springdale%E2%80%93Rogers%20Metropolitan%20Area">Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area</a> and <a href="Fort%20Smith%20metropolitan%20area">Fort Smith metropolitan area</a>, is a population, education, and economic center. The largest city in the state's eastern part is <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro</a>. The largest city in the state's southeastern part is <a href="Pine%20Bluff%2C%20Arkansas">Pine Bluff</a>.

The <a href="Territory%20of%20Arkansas">Territory of Arkansas</a> was <a href="admitted%20to%20the%20Union">admitted to the Union</a> as the 25th state on June 15, 1836. In 1861 Arkansas withdrew from the United States and joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Upon returning to the Union in 1868, the state would continue to suffer due to its earlier reliance on <a href="slavery">slavery</a> and the <a href="plantation%20economy">plantation economy</a>, causing the state to fall behind economically and socially. <a href="White%20American">White</a> rural interests continued to dominate the state's politics until the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Arkansas began to diversify its economy following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and relies on its service industry, aircraft, poultry, steel, tourism, cotton, and rice.

The <a href="culture%20of%20Arkansas">culture of Arkansas</a> is observable in museums, theaters, novels, television shows, restaurants, and athletic venues across the state. Arkansas's enduring image has earned the state "a special place in the American consciousness". People such as politician and educational advocate <a href="William%20Fulbright">William Fulbright</a>; former President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> who served as the 40th and 42nd Governor of Arkansas; his wife, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>; former <a href="NATO">NATO</a> <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> General <a href="Wesley%20Clark">Wesley Clark</a>, Walmart magnate <a href="Sam%20Walton">Sam Walton</a>; singer-songwriters <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> and <a href="Glen%20Campbell">Glen Campbell</a>; the poet <a href="Carolyn%20D.%20Wright">C.D. Wright</a>; and physicist <a href="William%20L.%20McMillan">William L. McMillan</a>, who was a pioneer in superconductor research; have all lived in Arkansas.

The name Arkansas derives from the same root as the name for the <a href="state%20of%20Kansas">state of Kansas</a>. The <a href="Kaw%20%28tribe%29">Kansa</a> tribe of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> are closely associated with the <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> tribes of the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>. The word "Arkansas" itself is a French pronunciation ("Arcansas") of a <a href="Quapaw">Quapaw</a> (a related "Kaw" tribe) word, "akakaze", meaning "land of downriver people" or the <a href="Sioux%20language">Sioux</a> word "akakaze" meaning "people of the south wind".

In 1881, the pronunciation of Arkansas with the final "s" being silent was made official by an act of the state legislature after a dispute arose between Arkansas's two U.S. senators as one favored the pronunciation as while the other favored .

In 2007, the state legislature passed a non-binding resolution declaring the possessive form of the state's name to be "Arkansas's" which has been followed increasingly by the state government.

Arkansas borders <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to the south, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> to the southwest, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> to the west, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> to the north, as well as <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> on the east. The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> classifies Arkansas as a <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern</a> state, sub-categorized among the <a href="West%20South%20Central%20States">West South Central States</a>. The <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in <a href="Clay%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Clay</a> and <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Greene</a>, counties where the <a href="St.%20Francis%20River">St. Francis River</a> forms the western boundary of the <a href="Missouri%20Bootheel">Missouri Bootheel</a>, and in many places where the channel of the Mississippi has meandered (or been straightened by man) from its original 1836 course.

Arkansas can generally be split into two halves, the highlands in the northwest half and the lowlands of the southeastern half. The highlands are part of the Southern Interior Highlands, including <a href="The%20Ozarks">The Ozarks</a> and the <a href="Ouachita%20Mountains">Ouachita Mountains</a>. The southern lowlands include the <a href="Gulf%20Coastal%20Plain">Gulf Coastal Plain</a> and the <a href="Arkansas%20Delta">Arkansas Delta</a>. This dual split can yield to general regions named northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast, or central Arkansas. These directionally named regions are broad and not defined along county lines. Arkansas has seven distinct natural regions: the Ozark Mountains, Ouachita Mountains, <a href="Arkansas%20River%20Valley">Arkansas River Valley</a>, Gulf Coastal Plain, <a href="Crowley%27s%20Ridge">Crowley's Ridge</a>, and the Arkansas Delta, with <a href="Central%20Arkansas">Central Arkansas</a> sometimes included as a blend of multiple regions.

The southeastern part of Arkansas along the <a href="Mississippi%20Alluvial%20Plain">Mississippi Alluvial Plain</a> is sometimes called the Arkansas Delta. This region is a flat landscape of <a href="River%20delta">rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding</a> of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas. The Delta region is bisected by a geological formation known as <a href="Crowley%27s%20Ridge">Crowley's Ridge</a>. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.

Northwest Arkansas is part of the <a href="Ozark%20Plateau">Ozark Plateau</a> including the <a href="Ozark%20Mountains">Ozark Mountains</a>, to the south are the <a href="Ouachita%20Mountains">Ouachita Mountains</a>, and these regions are divided by the <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas River</a>; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. These mountain ranges are part of the <a href="U.S.%20Interior%20Highlands">U.S. Interior Highlands</a> region, the only major mountainous region between the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. The highest point in the state is <a href="Mount%20Magazine">Mount Magazine</a> in the <a href="Ouachita%20Mountains">Ouachita Mountains</a>, which rises to above sea level.

Arkansas has many rivers, lakes, and reservoirs within or along its borders. Major tributaries of the Mississippi River include the Arkansas River, the <a href="White%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">White River</a>, and the <a href="St.%20Francis%20River">St. Francis River</a>. The Arkansas is fed by the <a href="Mulberry%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">Mulberry River</a> and the <a href="Fourche%20La%20Fave%20River">Fourche LaFave River</a> in the Arkansas River Valley, which is also home to <a href="Lake%20Dardanelle">Lake Dardanelle</a>. The <a href="Buffalo%20National%20River">Buffalo River</a>, <a href="Little%20Red%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">Little Red River</a>, <a href="Black%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">Black River</a> and <a href="Cache%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">Cache River</a> all serve as tributaries to the <a href="White%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">White River</a>, which also empties into the Mississippi. The <a href="Saline%20River%20%28Ouachita%20River%29">Saline River</a>, <a href="Little%20Missouri%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">Little Missouri River</a>, <a href="Bayou%20Bartholomew">Bayou Bartholomew</a>, and the <a href="Caddo%20River">Caddo River</a> all serve as tributaries to the <a href="Ouachita%20River">Ouachita River</a> in south Arkansas, <a href="Old%20River%20Control%20Structure">which eventually empties into the Mississippi</a> in Louisiana. The <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red River</a> briefly serves as the state's boundary with Texas. Arkansas has few natural lakes and many reservoirs, such as <a href="Bull%20Shoals%20Lake">Bull Shoals Lake</a>, <a href="Lake%20Ouachita">Lake Ouachita</a>, <a href="Greers%20Ferry%20Lake">Greers Ferry Lake</a>, <a href="Millwood%20Lake">Millwood Lake</a>, <a href="Beaver%20Lake%20%28Arkansas%29">Beaver Lake</a>, <a href="Norfork%20Lake">Norfork Lake</a>, <a href="DeGray%20Lake">DeGray Lake</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Conway">Lake Conway</a>.

Arkansas is home to many <a href="List%20of%20caves%20in%20Arkansas">caves</a>, such as <a href="Blanchard%20Springs%20Caverns">Blanchard Springs Caverns</a>. More than 43,000 Native American living, hunting and tool making sites, many of them Pre-Columbian burial mounds and rock shelters, have been cataloged by the State Archeologist. <a href="Crater%20of%20Diamonds%20State%20Park">Crater of Diamonds State Park</a> near <a href="Murfreesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Murfreesboro</a> is the world's only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public for digging. Arkansas is home to a dozen Wilderness Areas totaling . These areas are set aside for outdoor recreation and are open to hunting, fishing, hiking, and primitive camping. No mechanized vehicles nor developed campgrounds are allowed in these areas.

Arkansas is divided into three broad ecoregions, the "Ozark, Ouachita-Appalachian Forests", "Mississippi Alluvial and Southeast USA Coastal Plains", and the "Southeastern USA Plains"and two biomes, the subtropical coniferous forest and the temperate deciduous forest. The state is further divided into seven subregions: the Arkansas Valley, <a href="Boston%20Mountains">Boston Mountains</a>, <a href="Mississippi%20Alluvial%20Plain">Mississippi Alluvial Plain</a>, <a href="Crowley%27s%20Ridge">Mississippi Valley Loess Plain</a>, Ozark Highlands, Ouachita Mountains, and the South Central Plains. A 2010 <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> survey determined of Arkansas's land is forestland, or 56% of the state's total area. Dominant species in Arkansas's forests include "<a href="Oak">Quercus</a>" (oak), "<a href="Hickory">Carya</a>" (hickory), "<a href="Pinus%20echinata">Pinus echinata</a>" (shortleaf pine) and "<a href="Pinus%20taeda">Pinus taeda</a>" (loblolly pine).

Arkansas's plant life varies with its climate and elevation. The <a href="Arkansas%20Timberlands">pine belt</a> stretching from the Arkansas delta to Texas consists of dense oak-hickory-pine growth. Lumbering and paper milling activity is active throughout the region. In eastern Arkansas, one can find "<a href="Taxodium">Taxodium</a> " (cypress), "<a href="Quercus%20nigra">Quercus nigra</a>" (water oaks), and hickories with their roots submerged in the Mississippi Valley bayous indicative of the deep south. Nearby Crowley's Ridge is only home of the <a href="Liriodendron">tulip tree</a> in the state, and generally hosts more northeastern plant life such as the <a href="beech">beech</a> tree. The northwestern highlands are covered in an oak-hickory mixture, with <a href="Juniperus%20ashei">Ozark white cedars</a>, "<a href="Cornus%20%28genus%29">cornus</a>" (dogwoods), and "<a href="Cercis%20canadensis">Cercis canadensis</a>" (redbuds) also present. The higher peaks in the Arkansas River Valley play host to scores of ferns, including the "<a href="Woodsia%20scopulina">Woodsia scopulina</a>" and "<a href="Adiantum">Adiantum</a>" (maidenhair fern) on Mount Magazine.

Arkansas generally has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a>. While not bordering the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to influence the weather in the state. Generally, Arkansas has hot, humid summers and slightly drier, mild to cool winters. In <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, the daily high temperatures average around with lows around in July. In January highs average around and lows around . In <a href="Siloam%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Siloam Springs</a> in the northwest part of the state, the average high and low temperatures in July are and in January the average high and lows are . Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about ; somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. Snowfall is infrequent but most common in the northern half of the state. The half of the state south of Little Rock is more apt to see ice storms. Arkansas's all-time record high is at <a href="Ozark%2C%20Arkansas">Ozark</a> on August 10, 1936; the all-time record low is at <a href="Gravette%2C%20Arkansas">Gravette</a>, on February 13, 1905.

Arkansas is known for extreme weather and frequent storms. A typical year will see thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail, snow and ice storms. Between both the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Gulf States</a>, Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. Arkansas is located in <a href="Tornado%20Alley">Tornado Alley</a>, and as a result, a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical system</a> which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.

Before European settlement of North America, Arkansas was inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The <a href="Caddo">Caddo</a>, <a href="Osage%20Nation">Osage</a>, and <a href="Quapaw">Quapaw</a> peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer <a href="Hernando%20de%20Soto%20%28explorer%29">Hernando de Soto</a> in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas, the Ozark Mountains, and all the way to Texas. Around <a href="McArthur%2C%20Arkansas">McArthur, Arkansas</a>, he led a Spanish raid against the <a href="Quigualtam">Quigualtam</a> tribe, slaying men, women and children without mercy. De Soto died there the next day, in May 1542, opting for a watery burial in order to hide from the Natives that he was not a deity, and was a mortal. While he was dumped into the Mississippi River, the once rich De Soto's will read: "four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs". Later explorers included the French <a href="Jacques%20Marquette">Jacques Marquette</a> and <a href="Louis%20Jolliet">Louis Jolliet</a> in 1673, and Frenchmen <a href="Robert%20La%20Salle">Robert La Salle</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20Tonti">Henri de Tonti</a> in 1681. De Tonti established <a href="Arkansas%20Post">Arkansas Post</a> at a Quapaw village in 1686, making it the first European settlement in the territory. The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling of the <a href="Illinois%20language">Illinois</a> tribe's name for the <a href="Quapaw">Quapaw</a> people, who lived downriver from them. The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the <a href="Territory%20of%20Arkansaw">Territory of Arkansaw</a> on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically , , and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either "Arkansans" or "Arkansawyers". In 1881, the <a href="Arkansas%20General%20Assembly">Arkansas General Assembly</a> passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 (<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20110924223556/http%3A//www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm">official text</a>):
Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.
And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.
Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final "s" silent, the "a" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of "a" in "man" and the sounding of the terminal "s" is an innovation to be discouraged.
Citizens of the <a href="state%20of%20Kansas">state of Kansas</a> often pronounce the <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas River</a> as , in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.

Settlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century. These people used Arkansas Post as a home base and <a href="entrep%C3%B4t">entrepôt</a>. During the colonial period, Arkansas changed hands between <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> following the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, although neither showed interest in the remote settlement of Arkansas Post. In April 1783, Arkansas saw its only battle of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, a brief <a href="Battle%20of%20Arkansas%20Post%20%28American%20Revolutionary%20War%29">siege</a> of the post by British Captain James Colbert with the assistance of the <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> and <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>.

<a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> sold <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">French Louisiana</a> to the United States in 1803, including all of Arkansas, in a transaction known today as the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>. French soldiers remained as a garrison at <a href="Arkansas%20Post">Arkansas Post</a>. Following the purchase, the balanced give-and-take relationship between settlers and Native Americans began to change all along the frontier, including in Arkansas. Following <a href="Missouri%20compromise">a controversy over allowing slavery in the territory</a>, the <a href="Territory%20of%20Arkansas">Territory of Arkansas</a> was organized on July 4, 1819. Gradual emancipation in Arkansas was struck down by one vote, the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, allowing Arkansas to organize as a slave territory.

<a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">Slavery</a> became a wedge issue in Arkansas, forming a geographic divide that remained for decades. The owners and operators of the cotton <a href="plantation%20economy">plantation economy</a> in southeast Arkansas firmly supported slavery, as <a href="Slavery">slave labor</a> was perceived by them to be the best or "only" economically viable method of harvesting their cotton commodity crops. The "hill country" of northwest Arkansas was unable to grow cotton and relied on a cash-scarce, <a href="subsistence%20farming">subsistence farming</a> economy.

As European Americans settled throughout the East Coast and into the Midwest, in the 1830s the United States government forced the <a href="Indian%20Removal">removal</a> of many <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes to Arkansas and <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a> west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>.

Additional Native American removals began in earnest during the territorial period, with final Quapaw removal complete by 1833 as they were pushed into Indian Territory. The capital was relocated from Arkansas Post to <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> in 1821, during the territorial period.

When Arkansas applied for statehood, the slavery issue was again raised in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>. Congress eventually approved the <a href="Arkansas%20Constitution">Arkansas Constitution</a> after a 25-hour session, admitting Arkansas on June 15, 1836 as the 25th state and the 13th <a href="slave%20state">slave state</a>, having a population of about 60,000. Arkansas struggled with taxation to support its new state government, a problem made worse by <a href="Holford%20Bonds">a state banking scandal</a> and worse yet by the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>.

In early antebellum Arkansas, the southeast Arkansas slave based economy developed rapidly. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population. Plantation agriculture would set the state and region behind the nation for decades. The wealth developed among planters of southeast Arkansas caused a political rift to form between the northwest and southeast.

Many politicians were elected to office from <a href="The%20Family%20%28Arkansas%20politics%29">the Family</a>, the Southern rights political force in antebellum Arkansas. Residents generally wanted to avoid a civil war. When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, Arkansas voted to remain in the Union. Arkansas did not secede until <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> demanded Arkansas troops be sent to <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> to quell <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">the rebellion there</a>. The following month a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>.

Arkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and surrounding Southern states. The bloody <a href="Battle%20of%20Wilson%27s%20Creek">Battle of Wilson's Creek</a> just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cane%20Hill">Battle of Cane Hill</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Pea%20Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Prairie%20Grove">Battle of Prairie Grove</a>. Union General <a href="Samuel%20Ryan%20Curtis">Samuel Curtis</a> swept across the state to <a href="Helena-West%20Helena%2C%20Arkansas">Helena</a> in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs</a>, and then again to <a href="Washington%2C%20Arkansas">Washington</a> from 1863–1865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities. Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.

Under the <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Military%20reconstruction">Military Reconstruction Act</a>, Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> and Unionists, and led by Governor <a href="Powell%20Clayton">Powell Clayton</a>, they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.

In 1874, the <a href="Brooks-Baxter%20War">Brooks-Baxter War</a>, a political struggle between factions of the <a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican Party</a> shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> ordered <a href="Joseph%20Brooks%20%28politician%29">Joseph Brooks</a> to disperse his militant supporters.

Following the Brooks-Baxter War, a new state constitution was ratified, re-enfranchising former Confederates.

In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation of the state's name, to combat a controversy then simmering. (See Law and Government below.)

After Reconstruction, the state began to receive more <a href="immigrants">immigrants</a> and <a href="migrant%20worker">migrants</a>. Chinese, <a href="Italians">Italian</a>, and <a href="Syrian">Syrian</a> men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college.

Some early 20th-century immigration included people from eastern Europe. Together, these immigrants made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.

Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, <a href="Eureka%20Springs">Eureka Springs</a> in <a href="Carroll%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Carroll County</a> grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs</a>.

In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disfranchised</a> blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>, knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 they amended the state constitution to require a <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a> and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.

By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the <a href="white%20primary">white primary</a> in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> to enforce constitutional rights.

Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small immigration of <a href="Germans">German</a>, <a href="Slovaks">Slovak</a>, and Scots-Irish from Europe. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the <a href="Prairie">Prairie</a>, and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Lutheran and the Slovaks were primarily Catholic. The Irish were mostly Protestant from <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, of Scots and Northern Borders descent.

Based on the order of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> given shortly after <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a>'s <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, nearly 16,000 <a href="Japanese%20Americans">Japanese Americans</a> were forcibly removed from the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a> and incarcerated in two internment camp located in the <a href="Arkansas%20Delta">Arkansas Delta</a>. The <a href="Rohwer%20War%20Relocation%20Center">Rohwer Camp</a> in <a href="Desha%20County">Desha County</a> operated from September 1942 to November 1945 and its peak interned 8,475 prisoners. The <a href="Jerome%20War%20Relocation%20Center">Jerome War Relocation Center</a> in <a href="Drew%20County">Drew County</a> operated from October 1942 to June 1944 and held c. 8,000 prisoners.

After the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>'s decision in <a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">"Brown "v." Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas"</a> in 1954 that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, some students worked to integrate schools in the state. The <a href="Little%20Rock%20Nine">Little Rock Nine</a> brought Arkansas to national attention in 1957 when the Federal government had to intervene to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor <a href="Orval%20Faubus">Orval Faubus</a> had ordered the <a href="Arkansas%20National%20Guard">Arkansas National Guard</a> to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated.

<a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, the 42nd President of the United States, was born in <a href="Hope%2C%20Arkansas">Hope, Arkansas</a>. Before his presidency, Clinton served as the 40th and 42nd <a href="Governor%20of%20Arkansas">Governor of Arkansas</a>, a total of nearly 12 years.

<a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> has been Arkansas's <a href="List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States">capital city</a> since 1821 when it replaced <a href="Arkansas%20Post%2C%20Arkansas">Arkansas Post</a> as the capital of the <a href="Territory%20of%20Arkansas">Territory of Arkansas</a>. The state capitol was moved to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs</a> and later <a href="Washington%2C%20Arkansas">Washington</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> when the Union armies threatened the city in 1862, and state government did not return to Little Rock until after the war ended. Today, the <a href="Little%20Rock%E2%80%93North%20Little%20Rock%E2%80%93Conway%20metropolitan%20area">Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway metropolitan area</a> is the largest in the state, with a population of 724,385 in 2013.

The <a href="Fayetteville%E2%80%93Springdale%E2%80%93Rogers%20Metropolitan%20Area">Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area</a> is the second-largest metropolitan area in Arkansas, growing at the fastest rate due to the influx of businesses and the growth of the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> and <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a>.

The state has eight cities with populations above 50,000 (based on 2010 census). In descending order of size, they are: <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>, <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20Arkansas">Fayetteville</a>, <a href="Springdale%2C%20Arkansas">Springdale</a>, <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro</a>, <a href="North%20Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">North Little Rock</a>, <a href="Conway%2C%20Arkansas">Conway</a>, and <a href="Rogers%2C%20Arkansas">Rogers</a>.

The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Arkansas was 2,978,204 on July 1, 2015, a 2.14% increase since the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>.

As of 2015, Arkansas has an estimated population of 2,978,204. From fewer than 15,000 in 1820, Arkansas's population grew to 52,240 during a special census in 1835, far exceeding the 40,000 required to apply for statehood. Following statehood in 1836, the population doubled each decade until the <a href="1870%20United%20States%20Census">1870 Census</a> conducted following the Civil War. The state recorded growth in each successive decade, although it gradually slowed in the 20th century.

It recorded population losses in the <a href="1950%20United%20States%20Census">1950</a> and <a href="1960%20United%20States%20Census">1960 Censuses</a>. This outmigration was a result of multiple factors, including farm mechanization, decreasing labor demand, and young educated people leaving the state due to a lack of non-farming industry in the state. Arkansas again began to grow, recording positive growth rates ever since and exceeding the 2 million mark during the <a href="1980%20United%20States%20Census">1980 Census</a>. Arkansas's rate of change, age distributions, and gender distributions mirror national averages. <a href="Minority%20group">Minority group</a> data also approximates national averages. There are fewer people in Arkansas of Hispanic or Latino origin than the national average. The <a href="center%20of%20population">center of population</a> of Arkansas for 2000 was located in <a href="Perry%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Perry County</a>, near Nogal.

In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 80.1% white (74.2% <a href="non-Hispanic%20white">non-Hispanic white</a>), 15.6% black or <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, 0.9% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian</a> and <a href="Alaska%20Native">Alaska Native</a>, 1.3% <a href="Asian%20ethnicity">Asian</a>, and 1.8% from two or more races. <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanics</a> or Latinos of any race made up 6.6% of the population.

As of 2011, 39.0% of Arkansas's population younger than age 1 were minorities.

European Americans have a strong presence in the northwestern <a href="Ozarks">Ozarks</a> and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of the Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly <a href="Ulster%20Scots%20people">Scots-Irish</a>, Protestants from <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> lowlands and northern England part of the largest group of immigrants from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> before the American Revolution. <a href="English%20American">English</a> and <a href="Scots-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a> immigrants settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. Americans of <a href="English%20American">English</a> stock are found throughout the state.

The principal ancestries of Arkansas's residents in 2010 were surveyed to be the following:

Most of the people identifying as American are of English descent and/or Scots-Irish descent. Their families have been in the state so long, in many cases since before statehood, that they choose to identify simply as having American ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry. Many people who identify themselves as Irish descent are in fact of Scots-Irish descent.

According to the 2006–2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas's population (over the age of five) spoke only English at home. About 4.5% of the state's population spoke Spanish at home. About 0.7% of the state's population spoke any other <a href="Indo-European%20language">Indo-European language</a>s. About 0.8% of the state's population spoke an <a href="Languages%20of%20Asia">Asian language</a>, and 0.2% spoke other languages.

Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the <a href="Bible%20Belt">Bible Belt</a> and is predominantly Protestant. The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> with 661,382; the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a> with 158,574; non-denominational Evangelical Protestants with 129,638; and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> with 122,662.

Once a state with a cashless society in the uplands and <a href="Plantation%20economy">plantation</a> agriculture in the lowlands, Arkansas's economy has evolved and diversified. The state's gross domestic product (GDP) was $119 billion in 2015. Six <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a> companies are based in Arkansas, including the world's #1 retailer, <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a>, <a href="Tyson%20Foods">Tyson Foods</a>, <a href="J.B.%20Hunt">J.B. Hunt</a>, <a href="Dillard%27s">Dillard's</a>, <a href="Murphy%20USA">Murphy USA</a>, and <a href="Windstream">Windstream</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20GDP%20per%20capita%20%28nominal%29">per capita personal income</a> in 2015 was $39,107, ranking forty-fifth in the nation. The <a href="median%20household%20income">median household income</a> from 2011–15 was $41,371, ranking forty-ninth in the nation. The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, and paper products. Mines in Arkansas produce natural gas, oil, crushed stone, bromine, and vanadium. According to <a href="CNBC">CNBC</a>, Arkansas ranks as the 20th best state for business, with the 2nd-lowest cost of doing business, 5th-lowest cost of living, 11th best workforce, 20th-best economic climate, 28th-best educated workforce, 31st-best infrastructure and the 32nd-friendliest regulatory environment. Arkansas gained twelve spots in the best state for business rankings since 2011. As of 2014, Arkansas was found to be the most affordable US state to live in.

As of November 2016 the state's unemployment rate is 4.0%

Arkansas's earliest industries were <a href="fur%20trading">fur trading</a> and agriculture, with development of cotton <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantations</a> in the areas near the Mississippi River. They were dependent on slave labor through the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Today only approximately 3% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking 13th in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of rice, <a href="broiler">broiler</a>s, and turkeys, and ranks in the top three for <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, <a href="pullets">pullets</a>, and aquaculture (catfish). Forestry remains strong in the <a href="Arkansas%20Timberlands">Arkansas Timberlands</a>, and the state ranks fourth nationally and first in the South in softwood lumber production. Automobile parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. <a href="Bauxite">Bauxite</a> was formerly a large part of the state's economy, mined mostly around <a href="Saline%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Saline County</a>.

Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname "The Natural State" was created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still used to this day. The state maintains <a href="List%20of%20Arkansas%20state%20parks">52 state parks</a> and the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> maintains seven properties in Arkansas. The completion of the <a href="William%20Jefferson%20Clinton%20Presidential%20Library">William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library</a> in Little Rock has drawn many visitors to the city and revitalized the nearby <a href="Little%20Rock%20River%20Market%20District">River Market District</a>. Many cities also hold festivals which draw tourists to the culture of Arkansas, such as The Bradley County Pink Tomato Festival in Warren, <a href="King%20Biscuit%20Blues%20Festival">King Biscuit Blues Festival</a>, <a href="Ozark%20Folk%20Center">Ozark Folk Festival</a>, <a href="Toad%20Suck%20Daze">Toad Suck Daze</a>, and <a href="Tontitown%2C%20Arkansas">Tontitown Grape Festival</a>.

As of 2010 many Arkansas local newspapers are owned by <a href="WEHCO%20Media">WEHCO Media</a>, Alabama-based Lancaster Management, Kentucky-based <a href="Paxton%20Media%20Group">Paxton Media Group</a>, Missouri-based <a href="Rust%20Communications">Rust Communications</a>, Nevada-based <a href="Stephens%20Media%20%28newspapers%29">Stephens Media</a>, and New York-based <a href="GateHouse%20Media">GateHouse Media</a>.

The culture of Arkansas is available to all in various forms, whether it be architecture, literature, or fine and performing arts. The state's culture also includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture of Arkansas, ranging from football, baseball, and basketball to hunting and fishing. Perhaps the best-known piece of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype of its citizens as shiftless hillbillies. The reputation began when the state was characterized by early explorers as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves. The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is "<a href="Edward%20Washburn">The Arkansas Traveller</a>", a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s. Although intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions. The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the <a href="Little%20Rock%20Nine">Little Rock Nine</a> adding to Arkansas's enduring image.

Art and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. <a href="Crystal%20Bridges%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art</a> in <a href="Bentonville%2C%20Arkansas">Bentonville</a> was visited by 604,000 people in 2012, its first year. The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art. Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas <a href="List%20of%20Arkansas%20state%20parks">state parks</a>, including <a href="Historic%20Washington%20State%20Park">Historic Washington State Park</a>, <a href="Powhatan%20Historic%20State%20Park">Powhatan Historic State Park</a>, and <a href="Davidsonville%20Historic%20State%20Park">Davidsonville Historic State Park</a>.

Arkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the <a href="blues">blues</a> heritage of <a href="West%20Memphis%2C%20Arkansas">West Memphis</a>, <a href="Pine%20Bluff%2C%20Arkansas">Pine Bluff</a>, <a href="Helena-West%20Helena%2C%20Arkansas">Helena-West Helena</a> to <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a>, <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a>, and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the <a href="King%20Biscuit%20Blues%20Festival">King Biscuit Blues Festival</a> and <a href="Bikes%2C%20Blues%2C%20and%20BBQ">Bikes, Blues, and BBQ</a> pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in <a href="Mountain%20View%2C%20Arkansas">Mountain View</a> is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" by <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a> and "<a href="A%20Painted%20House">A Painted House</a>" by <a href="John%20Grisham">John Grisham</a> describe the culture at various time periods.

Sports have become an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year.

Team sports and especially collegiate football have been important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> first fielded a team in <a href="1894%20Arkansas%20Cardinals%20football%20team">1894</a> when football was a very dangerous game. Recent studies of the damage to team members from the concussions common in football make it clear that the danger persists.

"<a href="Calling%20the%20Hogs">Calling the Hogs</a>" is a cheer that shows support for the <a href="Arkansas%20Razorbacks">Razorbacks</a>, one of the two <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision">NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision</a> (FBS) teams in the state. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of the state. Following the <a href="Little%20Rock%20Nine">Little Rock Nine</a> integration crisis at <a href="Little%20Rock%20Central%20High%20School">Little Rock Central High School</a>, Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair the state's reputation. Although the University of Arkansas is based in <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20Arkansas">Fayetteville</a>, the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at <a href="War%20Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Arkansas%29">War Memorial Stadium</a> in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a> in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas.

<a href="Arkansas%20State%20University">Arkansas State University</a> joined the University of Arkansas in FBS (then known as Division I-A) in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games. Two other campuses of the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20System">University of Arkansas System</a> are Division I members. The <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20at%20Pine%20Bluff">University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff</a> is a member of the <a href="Southwestern%20Athletic%20Conference">Southwestern Athletic Conference</a>, a league whose members all play football in the second-level <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%23Football%20Championship%20Subdivision">Football Championship Subdivision</a> (FCS). The <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20at%20Little%20Rock">University of Arkansas at Little Rock</a> is a member of the FBS <a href="Sun%20Belt%20Conference">Sun Belt Conference</a>, but is one of two conference schools that has <a href="List%20of%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20non-football%20programs">no football program</a>. The state's other Division I member is the <a href="University%20of%20Central%20Arkansas">University of Central Arkansas</a>, which is a full member (including football) of the FCS <a href="Southland%20Conference">Southland Conference</a>.

Seven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in <a href="NCAA%20Division%20II">NCAA Division II</a>, with six in the <a href="Great%20American%20Conference">Great American Conference</a> and one in the <a href="Heartland%20Conference">Heartland Conference</a>. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in <a href="NCAA%20Division%20III">NCAA Division III</a>, in which <a href="athletic%20scholarship">athletic scholarship</a>s are prohibited.

Baseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs</a> from 1886-1920s. Two <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> teams are based in the state. The <a href="Arkansas%20Travelers">Arkansas Travelers</a> play at <a href="Dickey-Stephens%20Park">Dickey-Stephens Park</a> in <a href="North%20Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">North Little Rock</a>, and the <a href="Northwest%20Arkansas%20Naturals">Northwest Arkansas Naturals</a> play in <a href="Arvest%20Ballpark">Arvest Ballpark</a> in <a href="Springdale%2C%20Arkansas">Springdale</a>. Both teams compete in the <a href="Texas%20League">Texas League</a>.

Related to the state's frontier past, hunting continues in the state. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting and enforce those regulations. Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting <a href="duck">duck</a> in the <a href="Mississippi%20flyway">Mississippi flyway</a> and <a href="deer">deer</a> across the state. Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.

Fishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of <a href="Norfork%20Dam">Norfork Dam</a>, the <a href="Norfork%20Tailwater">Norfork Tailwater</a> and the <a href="White%20River%20%28Arkansas%29">White River</a> have become a destination for <a href="trout">trout</a> fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as <a href="Bull%20Shoals%2C%20Arkansas">Bull Shoals</a>, <a href="Hot%20Springs%20Village%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs Village</a>, and <a href="Fairfield%20Bay%2C%20Arkansas">Fairfield Bay</a> have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The <a href="Buffalo%20National%20River">Buffalo National River</a> has been preserved in its natural state by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> and is frequented by fly fishers annually.

Arkansas, as with many Southern states, have a high incidence of premature death, infant mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and occupational fatalities compared to the rest of the United States. The state is tied for 43rd with <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> in percentage of adults who regularly exercise. Arkansas is usually ranked as one of the least healthy states due to high obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle rates. In contrast though a Gallup poll demonstrates that Arkansas made the most immediate progress in reducing its number of uninsured residents following the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The percentage of uninsured in Arkansas dropped from 22.5 percent in 2013 to 12.4 percent in August 2014.

The <a href="List%20of%20smoking%20bans%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Arkansas">Arkansas Clean Indoor Air Act</a> went into effect in 2006, a statewide smoking ban excluding bars and some restaurants.

Healthcare in Arkansas is provided by a network of hospitals as members of the Arkansas Hospital Association. Major institutions with multiple branches include Baptist Health, <a href="Community%20Health%20Systems">Community Health Systems</a>, and <a href="HealthSouth">HealthSouth</a>. The <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20for%20Medical%20Sciences">University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences</a> (UAMS) in Little Rock operates the <a href="UAMS%20Medical%20Center">UAMS Medical Center</a>, a <a href="teaching%20hospital">teaching hospital</a> ranked as high performing nationally in <a href="cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="nephrology">nephrology</a>. The pediatric division of UAMS Medical Center is known as <a href="Arkansas%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Arkansas Children's Hospital</a>, nationally ranked in pediatric <a href="cardiology">cardiology</a> and heart surgery. Together, these two institutions are the state's only <a href="Trauma%20center%23Level%20I">Level I trauma centers</a>.

Arkansas has 1,064 state-funded kindergartens, elementary, junior- and senior high schools.

The state supports a network of public <a href="university">universities</a> and colleges, including two major university systems: <a href="Arkansas%20State%20University%20System">Arkansas State University System</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20System">University of Arkansas System</a>. The <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>, flagship campus of the University of Arkansas System in Fayetteville was ranked #63 among public schools in the nation by "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>". Other public institutions include <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas%20at%20Pine%20Bluff">University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20Tech%20University">Arkansas Tech University</a>, <a href="Henderson%20State%20University">Henderson State University</a>, <a href="Southern%20Arkansas%20University">Southern Arkansas University</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20Central%20Arkansas">University of Central Arkansas</a> across the state. It is also home to 11 private colleges and universities including <a href="Hendrix%20College">Hendrix College</a>, one of the nation's top 100 <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> colleges, according to U.S. News & World Report.

In the 1920s the state required all children to attend public schools. The school year was set at 131 days, although some areas were unable to meet that requirement.

Although unusual in the West, <a href="school%20corporal%20punishment">school corporal punishment</a> is not uncommon in Arkansas, with 20,083 public school students <a href="paddle%20%28spanking%29">paddled</a> at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of corporal punishment in public schools is higher only in Mississippi.

Arkansas is one of the most under-educated states in the Union. It ranks near the bottom in terms of percentage of the population with either a high school or college degree. The state's educational system has a history of under-funding, low teachers' salaries and political meddling in the curriculum.

Educational statistics during these early days are fragmentary and unreliable. Many counties did not submit full reports to the Secretary of State who did double-duty as Commissioner of Common Schools. However, the percentage of Whites over twenty years of age who were illiterate was given as:
In 2010 Arkansas students earned an average score of 20.3 on the <a href="ACT%20%28examination%29">ACT exam</a>, just below the national average of 21. These results were expected due to the large increase in the number of students taking the exam since the establishment of the Academic Challenge Scholarship. Top high schools receiving recognition from the <a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a> are spread across the state, including <a href="Haas%20Hall%20Academy">Haas Hall Academy</a> in Fayetteville, <a href="KIPP%20Delta%20Collegiate%20High%20School">KIPP Delta Collegiate</a> in <a href="Helena-West%20Helena%2C%20Arkansas">Helena-West Helena</a>, <a href="Bentonville%20High%20School">Bentonville</a>, <a href="Rogers%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Rogers</a>, <a href="Rogers%20Heritage%20High%20School">Rogers Heritage</a>, <a href="Valley%20Springs%20High%20School">Valley Springs</a>, <a href="Searcy%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Searcy</a>, and <a href="McCrory%20High%20School">McCrory</a>. A total of 81 Arkansas high schools were ranked by the U.S. News & World Report in 2012.

Arkansas ranks as the 32nd smartest state on the <a href="Morgan%20Quitno">Morgan Quitno</a> Smartest State Award, 44th in percentage of residents with at least a high school diploma, and 48th in percentage of bachelor's degree attainment. Arkansas has been making strides in education reform. "<a href="Education%20Week">Education Week</a>" has praised the state, ranking Arkansas in the top 10 of their Quality Counts Education Rankings every year since 2009 while scoring it in the top 5 during 2012 and 2013. Arkansas specifically received an A in Transition and Policy Making for progress in this area consisting of early-childhood education, college readiness, and career readiness. Governor <a href="Mike%20Beebe">Mike Beebe</a> has made improving education a major issue through his attempts to spend more on education. Through reforms, the state is a leader in requiring curricula designed to prepare students for postsecondary education, rewarding teachers for student achievement, and providing incentives for principals who work in lower-tier schools.

As an organized territory, and later in the early days of statehood, education was funded by the sales of Federally-controlled public lands. This system was inadequate and prone to local graft. In an 1854 message to the Legislature, Governor <a href="Elias%20N.%20Conway">Elias N. Conway</a> said, "We have a common-school law intended as a system to establish common schools in all part of the state; but for the want of adequate means there are very few in operation under this law." At this time, only about a quarter of children were enrolled in school.

In 1867, the state legislature was still controlled by ex-Confederates. It passed a Common Schools Law that allowed public funded but limited schools to White children.

The 1868 legislature banned former Confederates and passed a more wide-ranging law detailing funding and administrative issues and allowing Black children to attend school. In furtherance of this, the postwar 1868 state constitution was the first to permit a personal-property tax to fund the lands and buildings for public schools. With the 1868 elections, the first county school commissioners took office.

In 2014, the state spent $9,616 per student, compared with a national average of about $11,000 putting Arkansas in nineteenth place.

1829 Territorial legislature permits townships to establish schools. 
1868 State law required racial segregation of schools.

Several main corridors pass through Little Rock, including <a href="Interstate%2030%20in%20Arkansas">Interstate 30</a> (I-30) and <a href="Interstate%2040%20in%20Arkansas">I-40</a> (the nation's 3rd-busiest trucking corridor). In northeast Arkansas, <a href="Interstate%2055%20in%20Arkansas">I-55</a> travels north from <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a> to <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, with a new spur to <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro</a> (<a href="Interstate%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B555">I-555</a>). Northwest Arkansas is served by <a href="Interstate%20540%20%28Arkansas%29">I-540</a> from <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith</a> to <a href="Bella%20Vista%2C%20Arkansas">Bella Vista</a>, which is a segment of future <a href="Interstate%2049%20in%20Arkansas">I-49</a>. The state also has the 13th largest <a href="List%20of%20Arkansas%20state%20highways">state highway system</a> in the nation.

Arkansas is served by of railroad track divided among twenty-six railroad companies including three <a href="Class%20I%20railroads">Class I railroads</a>. Freight railroads are concentrated in southeast Arkansas to serve the industries in the region. The <a href="Texas%20Eagle">Texas Eagle</a>, an Amtrak passenger train, serves five stations in the state <a href="Walnut%20Ridge%20%28Amtrak%20station%29">Walnut Ridge</a>, <a href="Little%20Rock%20%28Amtrak%20station%29">Little Rock</a>, <a href="Malvern%20%28Amtrak%20station%29">Malvern</a>, <a href="Arkadelphia%20%28Amtrak%20station%29">Arkadelphia</a>, and <a href="Texarkana%20%28Amtrak%20station%29">Texarkana</a>.

Arkansas also benefits from the use of its rivers for commerce. The <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas River</a> are both major rivers. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> maintains the <a href="McClellan-Kerr%20Arkansas%20River%20Navigation%20System">McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System</a>, allowing barge traffic up the Arkansas River to the <a href="Port%20of%20Catoosa">Port of Catoosa</a> in <a href="Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma">Tulsa, Oklahoma</a>.

There are four airports with commercial service: <a href="Clinton%20National%20Airport">Clinton National Airport</a>, <a href="Northwest%20Arkansas%20Regional%20Airport">Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport</a>, <a href="Fort%20Smith%20Regional%20Airport">Fort Smith Regional Airport</a>, and <a href="Texarkana%20Regional%20Airport">Texarkana Regional Airport</a>, with <a href="List%20of%20airports%20in%20Arkansas">dozens of smaller airports in the state</a>.

Public transit and community transport services for the elderly or those with developmental disabilities are provided by agencies such as the <a href="Central%20Arkansas%20Transit%20Authority">Central Arkansas Transit Authority</a> and the <a href="Ozark%20Regional%20Transit">Ozark Regional Transit</a>, organizations that are part of the <a href="Arkansas%20Transit%20Association">Arkansas Transit Association</a>.

As with the federal government of the United States, political power in Arkansas is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are <a href="term-limited">term-limited</a> to two full terms plus any partial terms before the first full term.

The Governor of Arkansas is <a href="Asa%20Hutchinson">Asa Hutchinson</a>, a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, who was inaugurated on January 13, 2015. The six other elected executive positions in Arkansas are <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Arkansas">lieutenant governor</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Arkansas">secretary of state</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20State%20Treasurer">treasurer</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20State%20Auditor">auditor</a>, and land commissioner. The governor also appoints qualified individuals to lead various state boards, committees, and departments. Arkansas governors served two-year terms until a referendum lengthened the term to four years, effective with the 1986 general election.

In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.

The <a href="Arkansas%20General%20Assembly">Arkansas General Assembly</a> is the state's <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> bodies of legislators, composed of the <a href="Arkansas%20Senate">Senate</a> and <a href="Arkansas%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The Senate contains 35 members from districts of approximately equal population. These districts are redrawn decennially with each US census, and in election years ending in "2", the entire body is put up for reelection. Following the election, half of the seats are designated as two-year seats and will be up for reelection again in two years, these "half-terms" do not count against a legislator's term limits. The remaining half serve a full four-year term. This staggers elections such that half the body is up for re-election every two years and allows for complete body turnover following redistricting. Arkansas voters selected a 21–14 Republican majority in the Senate in 2012. Arkansas House members can serve a maximum of three two-year terms. House districts are redistricted by the Arkansas Board of Apportionment. Following the 2012 elections, Republicans gained a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.

The Republican Party <a href="majority">majority</a> status in the Arkansas State House of Representatives following the 2012 elections is the party's first since 1874. Arkansas was the last state of the old Confederacy to never have Republicans control either chamber of its house since the Civil War.

Following the term limits changes, studies have shown that lobbyists have become less influential in state politics. Legislative staff, not subject to term limits, have acquired additional power and influence due to the high rate of elected official turnover.

Arkansas's judicial branch has five court systems: <a href="Arkansas%20Supreme%20Court">Arkansas Supreme Court</a>, <a href="Arkansas%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Arkansas Court of Appeals</a>, Circuit Courts, District Courts and City Courts.

Most cases begin in district court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. There are 25 state district court judges presiding over 15 districts, with more districts to be created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no <a href="appeal">right of appeal</a> from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.

The Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>.

Both of Arkansas's U.S. Senators, <a href="John%20Boozman">John Boozman</a> and <a href="Tom%20Cotton">Tom Cotton</a>, are Republicans. The state has four seats in <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. All four seats are held by Republicans: <a href="Rick%20Crawford%20%28politician%29">Rick Crawford</a> (<a href="Arkansas%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">1st district</a>), <a href="French%20Hill%20%28politician%29">French Hill</a> (<a href="Arkansas%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">2nd district</a>), <a href="Steve%20Womack">Steve Womack</a> (<a href="Arkansas%27s%203rd%20congressional%20district">3rd district</a>), and <a href="Bruce%20Westerman">Bruce Westerman</a> (<a href="Arkansas%27s%204th%20congressional%20district">4th district</a>).

Arkansas Governor <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> brought national attention to the state with a long speech at the <a href="1988%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1988 Democratic National Convention</a> endorsing <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a>. Some journalist suggested the speech was a threat to his ambitions, Clinton defined it "a comedy of error, just one of those fluky things". Clinton won the Democratic nomination for President the following cycle. Presenting himself as a "New Democrat" and using incumbent <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>'s against him, Clinton won the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201992">1992 presidential election</a> (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire <a href="populism">populist</a> <a href="Ross%20Perot">Ross Perot</a>, who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).

Most Republican strength traditionally lied mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith</a> and <a href="Bentonville%2C%20Arkansas">Bentonville</a>, as well as North Central Arkansas around the <a href="Mountain%20Home%2C%20Arkansas">Mountain Home</a> area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.

Arkansas has only elected three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, <a href="Tim%20Hutchinson">Tim Hutchinson</a>, who was defeated after one term by <a href="Mark%20Pryor">Mark Pryor</a>; <a href="John%20Boozman">John Boozman</a>, who defeated incumbent <a href="Blanche%20Lincoln">Blanche Lincoln</a>; and <a href="Tom%20Cotton">Tom Cotton</a>, who defeated Mark Pryor in the 2014 elections. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.

In 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans (<a href="Rick%20Crawford%20%28politician%29">Rick Crawford</a> – <a href="Army">Army</a>; <a href="Tim%20Griffin">Tim Griffin</a> – <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve">Army Reserve</a>; <a href="Steve%20Womack">Steve Womack</a> – Army <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a>, <a href="Tom%20Cotton">Tom Cotton</a>- Army). In 2014, the last Democrat in Arkansas's Congressional Delegation, Mark Pryor, was defeated in campaign to win a third term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the entire congressional delegation in GOP hands for the first time since <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>.

Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the <a href="Arkansas%20Constitution">Arkansas Constitution</a> Arkansas is a <a href="right%20to%20work%20state">right to work state</a>, its voters passed a ban on <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> with 75% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful with legislation on its books banning abortion in the event "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>" is ever overturned.

Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the <a href="National%20Park%20System">National Park System</a>. These include:

Apus

Apus is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern sky</a>. It represents a <a href="bird-of-paradise">bird-of-paradise</a>, and its name means "without feet" in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in his 1603 "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted and gave the brighter stars their <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756.

The five brightest stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 3.8 is <a href="Alpha%20Apodis">Alpha Apodis</a>, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of the Sun. Marginally fainter is <a href="Gamma%20Apodis">Gamma Apodis</a>, another ageing giant star. <a href="Delta%20Apodis">Delta Apodis</a> is a <a href="double%20star">double star</a>, the two components of which are 103 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a> apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have been found to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>.

Apus was one of twelve constellations created by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a> who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1603 under the Dutch name "De Paradijs Voghel", "The Bird of Paradise", and Plancius called the constellation "Paradysvogel Apis Indica"; the first word is <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> for "bird of paradise". "Apis" (Latin for "bee") is assumed to have been a typographical error for "avis" ("bird").

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. Bayer called it "Apis Indica" while fellow astronomers <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> and his son-in-law <a href="Jakob%20Bartsch">Jakob Bartsch</a> called it "Apus" or "Avis Indica". The name "Apus" is derived from the Greek "apous", meaning "without feet". This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed. Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>'s expedition brought them home. The constellation later lost some of its tail when <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> used those stars to establish <a href="Octans">Octans</a> in the 1750s.

Covering 206.3 square degrees and hence 0.5002% of the sky, Apus ranks 67th of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole <a href="constellation">constellation</a> is visible to observers south of 7°N. It is bordered by <a href="Ara%20%28constellation%29">Ara</a>, <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a> and <a href="Circinus">Circinus</a> to the north, <a href="Musca">Musca</a> and <a href="Chamaeleon">Chamaeleon</a> to the west, Octans to the south, and <a href="Pavo%20%28constellation%29">Pavo</a> to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Aps'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −67.48° and −83.12°.

Lacaille gave twelve stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s, labelling them Alpha through to Kappa, including two stars next to each other as Delta and another two stars near each other as Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5. <a href="Beta%20Apodis">Beta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Apodis">Gamma</a> and <a href="Delta%20Apodis">Delta Apodis</a> form a narrow triangle, with <a href="Alpha%20Apodis">Alpha Apodis</a> lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.

Alpha Apodis is an <a href="giant%20star">orange giant</a> of spectral type K3III located 447 ± 8 light years away from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white (B-type) main sequence star</a> before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> approximately 928 times that of the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 light years away, with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a <a href="giant%20star">yellow giant</a> of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a surface temperature of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a <a href="double%20star">double star</a>, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 light years away. It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days. Delta is an <a href="orange%20giant">orange giant</a> star of spectral type K3III, located 610 ± 30 light years away, with a magnitude of 5.3. The separate components can be resolved with the naked eye.

The fifth-brightest star is <a href="Zeta%20Apodis">Zeta Apodis</a> at magnitude 4.8, a star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant of spectral type K1III, with a surface temperature of 4649 K and a luminosity 133 times that of the Sun. It is 297 ± 8 light-years distant. Near Zeta is <a href="Iota%20Apodis">Iota Apodis</a>, a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system around 1300 light-years distant, that is composed of two blue-white main sequence stars that orbit each other every 59.32 years. Of spectral types B9V and B9.5 V, they are both over three times as massive as the Sun.

<a href="Eta%20Apodis">Eta Apodis</a> is a <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main sequence star</a> located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an <a href="infrared%20excess">excess</a> of 24 μm infrared radiation, which may be caused by a <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> of dust orbiting at a distance of more than 31 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s from it.

<a href="Theta%20Apodis">Theta Apodis</a> is a cool red giant of spectral type M7 III located 370 ± 20 light years distant. It shines with a luminosity approximately 3879 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 3151 K. A semiregular variable, it varies by 0.56 magnitudes with a period of 119 days—or approximately 4 months. It is losing mass at the rate of times the mass of the Sun per year through its <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>. Dusty material ejected from this star is interacting with the surrounding <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>, forming a <a href="bow%20shock">bow shock</a> as the star moves through the galaxy. <a href="NO%20Apodis">NO Apodis</a> is a red giant of spectral type M3III that varies between magnitudes 5.71 and 5.95. Located around 883 light-years distant, it shines with a luminosity estimated at 2059 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 3568 K. <a href="S%20Apodis">S Apodis</a> is a rare <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a>, an extremely hydrogen-deficient supergiant thought to have arisen as the result of the merger of two white dwarfs; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012. It has a baseline magnitude of 9.7. <a href="R%20Apodis">R Apodis</a> is a star that was given a <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star designation</a>, yet has turned out not to be variable. Of magnitude 5.3, it is another orange giant.

Two star systems have had <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>s discovered by <a href="doppler%20spectroscopy">doppler spectroscopy</a>, and the substellar companion of a third star system—the sunlike star <a href="HD%20131664">HD 131664</a>—has since been found to be a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> with a calculated mass of the companion to 23 times that of Jupiter (minimum of 18 and maximum of 49 Jovian masses). <a href="HD%20134606">HD 134606</a> is a yellow sunlike star of spectral type G6IV that has begun expanding and cooling off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. Three planets orbit it with periods of 12, 59.5 and 459 days, successively larger as they are further away from the star. <a href="HD%20137388">HD 137388</a> is another star—of spectral type K2IV—that is cooler than the Sun and has begun cooling off the main sequence. Around 47% as luminous and 88% as massive as the Sun, with 85% of its diameter, it is thought to be around 7.4 ± 3.9 billion years old. It has a planet that is 79 times as massive as the Earth and orbits its sun every 330 days at an average distance of 0.89 astronomical units (AU).
The <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> covers much of the constellation's area. Of the deep-sky objects in Apus, there are two prominent <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s—<a href="NGC%206101">NGC 6101</a> and <a href="IC%204499">IC 4499</a>—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a globular cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains a high concentration of massive bright stars known as <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a>s, thought to be the result of two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose globular cluster in the medium-far <a href="galactic%20halo">galactic halo</a>; its apparent magnitude is 10.6.

The galaxies in the constellation are faint. IC 4633 is a very faint spiral galaxy surrounded by a vast amount of Milky Way line-of-sight <a href="integrated%20flux%20nebula">integrated flux nebula</a>e—large faint clouds thought to be lit by large numbers of stars.

Abadan, Iran

Abadan ( "Ābādān") is a city in and the capital of <a href="Abadan%20County">Abadan County</a>, <a href="Khuzestan%20Province">Khuzestan Province</a> which is located in central west of Iran. It lies on <a href="Abadan%20Island">Abadan Island</a> ( long, 3–19 km or 2–12 miles wide), the island is bounded in the west by the <a href="Shatt%20al-Arab">Arvand</a> waterway and to the east by the <a href="Bahmanshir">Bahmanshir</a> outlet of the <a href="Karun%20River">Karun River</a> (the <a href="Shatt%20al-Arab">Shatt al-Arab</a>), from the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, near the Iraqi-Iran border.

The earliest mention of the island of Abadan, if not the port itself is found in works of the geographer <a href="Marcian">Marcian</a>, who renders the name "Apphadana". Earlier, the classical geographer, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> notes "Apphana" as an island off the mouth of the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> (which is, where the modern Island of Abadan is located). An <a href="etymology">etymology</a> for this name is presented by 'B. Farahvashi" to be derived from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> word "ab" (water) and the root "pā" (guard, watch) thus "coastguard station").

In the Islamic times, a pseudo-etymology was produced by the historian <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Yahya%20al-Baladhuri">Ahmad ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri</a> (d.892) quoting a folk story that the town was presumably founded by one ""Abbad bin Hosayn" from the Arabian Tribe of <a href="Banu%20Tamim">Banu Tamim</a>", who established a garrison there during the governorship of "Hajjaj" in the <a href="Ummayad">Ummayad</a> period.

In the subsequent centuries, the Persian version of the name had begun to come into general use before it was adopted by official decree in 1935.

The civilian population of the city dropped close to zero during the eight years of the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a> (1980–88). The 1986 census recorded only 6 people. In 1991, 84,774 had returned to live in the city. By 2001, the population had jumped to 206,073, and it was 217,988, in 48,061 families, according to 2006 census. <a href="Abadan%20Refinery">Abadan Refinery</a> is one of the largest in the world.The population today has reached almost 350,000 people.

Only 9% of managers (of the oil company) were from Khuzestan. The proportion of natives of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, the <a href="Caspians">Caspian</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan%20%28Iran%29">Azarbaijan</a> and <a href="Kurdistan%20Province%2C%20Iran">Kurdistan</a> rose from 4% of <a href="blue%20collar">blue collar</a> workers to 22% of <a href="White-collar%20worker">white collar</a> workers to 45% of managers, thus <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>-speakers were concentrated on the lower rungs of the work force, managers tended to be brought in from some distance. There is also a single Armenian church in the centre of the city.

Abadan is thought to have been further developed into a major port city under the <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a>s' rule. In this time period, it was a commercial source of salt and woven <a href="mat">mat</a>s. The <a href="siltation">siltation</a> of the river delta forced the town further away from water; In the 14th century, however, <a href="Ibn%20Battutah">Ibn Battutah</a> described Abadan just as a small port in a flat salty plain. Politically, Abadan was often the subject of dispute between the nearby states; in 1847, Persia acquired it from <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, in which state Abadan has remained since. From the 17th century onward, the island of Abadan was part of the lands of the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> "Ka'ab" (<a href="Bani%20Kaab">Bani Kaab</a>) tribe. One section of this tribe, "Mohaysen", had its headquarters at "Mohammara"(present-day <a href="Khorramshahr">Khorramshahr</a>), until the removal of Shaikh <a href="Khaz%27al%20Khan">Khaz'al Khan</a> in 1924.

It was not until the 20th century that rich oil fields were discovered in the area. On 16 July 1909, after secret negotiation with the British consul, <a href="Percy%20Cox">Percy Cox</a>, assisted by <a href="Arnold%20Wilson">Arnold Wilson</a>, <a href="Khaz%27al%20al-Ka%27bi">Sheik Khaz'al</a> agreed to a rental agreement for the island including Abadan. The Sheik continued to administer the island until 1924. The <a href="Anglo-Persian%20Oil%20Company">Anglo-Persian Oil Company</a> built their first pipeline terminus <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> in Abadan, starting in 1909 and completing it in 1912, with oil flowing by August 1912 (see <a href="Abadan%20Refinery">Abadan Refinery</a>). Refinery throughput numbers rose from 33,000 tons in 1912-1913 to 4,338,000 tons in 1931. By 1938, it was the largest in the world.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Abadan was the site of brief combat between Iranian forces and British and Indian troops during the <a href="Anglo-Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Iran">Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran</a>. Later, Abadan was a major logistics centre for <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> aircraft being sent to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> by the United States.

In 1951, Iran nationalized all oil properties and refining ground to a stop on the island. Rioting broke out in Abadan, after the government had decided to nationalize the oil facilities, and three British workers were killed. It was not until 1954, that a settlement was reached, which allowed a consortium of international oil companies to manage the production and refining on the island. This continued until 1973, when the <a href="NIOC">NIOC</a> took over all facilities. After total nationalization, Iran focused on supplying oil domestically and built a pipeline from Abadan to <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>.

Whereas Abadan was not a major cultural or religious centre, it did play an important role in the <a href="Islamic%20Revolution">Islamic Revolution</a>. On 19 August 1978 the anniversary of the US backed coup d'état which overthrew the nationalist and popular Iranian prime minister, Dr. <a href="Mohammed%20Mossadegh">Mohammed Mossadegh</a>— the Cinema Rex, a movie theatre in Abadan, Iran, was set ablaze. The <a href="Cinema%20Rex%20Fire">Cinema Rex Fire</a> caused 430 deaths, but more importantly, it was another event that kept the Islamic Revolution moving ahead. At the time there was much confusion and misinformation about the perpetrators of the incident. The public largely put the blame on the local police chief and also the Shah and <a href="SAVAK">SAVAK</a>. The reformist <a href="Sobhe%20Emrooz">Sobhe Emrooz</a> newspaper in one of its editorials revealed that the Cinema Rex was burned down by the radical Islamists. The newspaper was shut down immediately after. Over time, the true culprits, radical Islamists, were apprehended and the logic behind this act was revealed, as they were trying both to foment the general public to distrust the government even more, and also as they perceived cinema as a link to the Americans. This fire was one of four during a short period in August, with other fires in <a href="Mashhad">Mashhad</a>, <a href="Urmia">Rizaiya</a>, and <a href="Shiraz">Shiraz</a>.

In September 1980, Abadan was almost overrun during a surprise attack on Khuzestan by Iraq, marking the beginning of the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a>. For 12 months Abadan was besieged, but never captured, by Iraqi forces, and in September 1981, the Iranians broke the siege of Abadan. Much of the city, including the oil refinery which was the world's largest refinery with capacity of 628,000 barrels per day, was badly damaged or destroyed by the siege and by bombing. Previous to the war, the city's civilian population was about 300,000, but before it was over, almost the entire populace had sought refuge elsewhere in Iran.

After the war, the biggest concern was the rebuilding of Abadan's oil refinery, as it was operating at 10% of capacity due to damage. In 1993, the refinery began limited operation and the port reopened. By 1997, the refinery reached the same rate of production as before the war. Recently, Abadan has been the site of major labour activity as workers at the oil refineries in the city have staged walkouts and strikes to protest non-payment of wages and the political situation in the country.

To honour the 100th anniversary of the refining of oil in Abadan, city officials are planning an oil museum. The Abadan oil refinery was featured on the reverse side of Iran's 100-rial banknotes printed in 1965 and from 1971 to 1973. Abadan today has been declared as a free zone city. The healthy relationship between Iran and Iraq has become one of the transit cities connecting both countries through a 40-minute drive.

The climate in Abadan is <a href="arid%20climate">arid</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "BWh") and similar to <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad's</a>, but slightly hotter due to Abadan's lower latitude. Summers are dry and extremely hot, with temperatures above almost daily and temperatures above can be almost common. Abadan is notably one of the few hottest populated places on earth and experiences many sand and dust storms. Winters are mildly wet and spring-like, though subject to cold spells. Winter temperatures are around . The <a href="Hottest%20place%20on%20Earth">world's highest unconfirmed temperature</a> was a temperature flare up during a <a href="heat%20burst">heat burst</a> in June 1967, with a temperature of . The lowest recorded temperature in the city range is . which was recorded on January 20, 1964 and February 3, 1967 while the highest is , recorded on July 11, 1951 and August 9, 1981.

The <a href="Abadan%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Abadan Institute of Technology</a> was established in Abadan in 1939. The school specialized in engineering and petroleum <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, and was designed to train staff for the refinery in town. The school's name has since changed several times, but since 1989 has been considered a branch campus of the <a href="Petroleum%20University%20of%20Technology">Petroleum University of Technology</a>, centred in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>.

There is an international <a href="Abadan%20Airport">airport</a> in Abadan. It is represented by the <a href="IATA%20airport%20code">IATA airport code</a> ABD.

There is a large amount of external investment from East Asian countries that are building oil refineries and developing a lot of real estate.

Alexander Fleming

Sir Alexander Fleming (6 August 188111 March 1955) was a Scottish <a href="physician">physician</a>, <a href="biologist">biologist</a>, <a href="pharmacologist">pharmacologist</a> and <a href="botanist">botanist</a>. His best-known discoveries are the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="lysozyme">lysozyme</a> in 1923 and the world's first <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> substance benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) from the mould "<a href="Penicillium%20notatum">Penicillium notatum</a>" in 1928, for which he shared the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> in 1945 with <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Boris%20Chain">Ernst Boris Chain</a>. He wrote many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy.

Fleming was <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">knighted</a> for his scientific achievements in 1944. In 1999, he was named in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the . In 2002, he was chosen in the BBC's television poll for determining the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>, and in 2009, he was also voted third "greatest Scot" in an opinion poll conducted by <a href="STV%20%28TV%20channel%29">STV</a>, behind only <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> and <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>.

Born on 6 August 1881 at Lochfield farm near <a href="Darvel">Darvel</a>, in <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a>, Scotland, Alexander was the third of the four children of farmer Hugh Fleming (1816–1888) from his second marriage to Grace Stirling Morton (1848–1928), the daughter of a neighbouring farmer. Hugh Fleming had four surviving children from his first marriage. He was 59 at the time of his second marriage, and died when Alexander was seven.

Fleming went to <a href="Loudoun%20Moor%20School">Loudoun Moor School</a> and Darvel School, and earned a two-year scholarship to <a href="Kilmarnock%20Academy">Kilmarnock Academy</a> before moving to London, where he attended the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">Royal Polytechnic Institution</a>. After working in a shipping office for four years, the twenty-year-old Fleming inherited some money from an uncle, John Fleming. His elder brother, Tom, was already a physician and suggested to him that he should follow the same career, and so in 1903, the younger Alexander enrolled at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%20Medical%20School">St Mary's Hospital Medical School</a> in <a href="Paddington">Paddington</a>; he qualified with an <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Medicine%2C%20Bachelor%20of%20Surgery">MBBS</a> degree from the school with distinction in 1906.

Fleming had been a private in the <a href="London%20Scottish%20Regiment">London Scottish Regiment</a> of the <a href="Volunteer%20Force%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Volunteer Force</a> since 1900, and had been a member of the rifle club at the medical school. The captain of the club, wishing to retain Fleming in the team, suggested that he join the research department at St Mary's, where he became assistant bacteriologist to Sir <a href="Almroth%20Wright">Almroth Wright</a>, a pioneer in <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a> therapy and immunology. In 1908, he gained a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">BSc</a> degree with Gold Medal in <a href="Bacteriology">Bacteriology</a>, and became a lecturer at St Mary's until 1914.
Fleming served throughout <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> as a captain in the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>, and was <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Dispatches">Mentioned in Dispatches</a>. He and many of his colleagues worked in battlefield hospitals at the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France. In 1918 he returned to <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%2C%20London">St Mary's Hospital</a>, where he was elected Professor of Bacteriology of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> in 1928. In 1951 he was elected the Rector of the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> for a term of three years.

During World War I, Fleming witnessed the death of many soldiers from <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a> resulting from infected <a href="wound">wound</a>s. <a href="Antiseptic">Antiseptic</a>s, which were used at the time to treat infected wounds, often worsened the injuries. In an article he submitted for the medical journal "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct as a result of his own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least as well as they removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir <a href="Almroth%20Wright">Almroth Wright</a> strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.

At St Mary’s Hospital Fleming continued his investigations into antibacterial substances. Testing the nasal secretions from a patient with a heavy cold, he found that nasal mucus had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. This was the first recorded discovery of <a href="lysozyme">lysozyme</a>, an enzyme present in many secretions including tears, saliva, skin, hair and nails as well as mucus. Although he was able to obtain larger amounts of lysozyme from egg whites, the enzyme was only effective against small counts of harmless bacteria, and therefore had little therapeutic potential.

By 1927, Fleming had been investigating the properties of <a href="staphylococcus">staphylococci</a>. He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking ""That's funny"". Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Price, who reminded him, "That's how you discovered <a href="lysozyme">lysozyme</a>." Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the "<a href="Penicillium">Penicillium</a>" genus, and, after some months of calling it ""mould juice"", named the substance it released "<a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>" on 7 March 1929. The laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the <a href="Alexander%20Fleming%20Laboratory%20Museum">Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum</a> in St. Mary's Hospital, <a href="Paddington">Paddington</a>.

He investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> pathogens that cause <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> and <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, but not <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> or <a href="paratyphoid%20fever">paratyphoid fever</a>, which are caused by <a href="Gram-negative">Gram-negative</a> bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time. It also affected "<a href="Neisseria%20gonorrhoeae">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</a>," which causes <a href="gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea</a> although this bacterium is Gram-negative.

Fleming published his discovery in 1929, in the British "Journal of Experimental Pathology," but little attention was paid to his article. Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating "penicillium" was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body ("in vivo") to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming’s trials occasionally showed more promise, and he continued, until 1940, to try to interest a chemist skilled enough to further refine usable penicillin. Fleming finally abandoned penicillin, and not long after he did, <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Boris%20Chain">Ernst Boris Chain</a> at the <a href="Radcliffe%20Infirmary">Radcliffe Infirmary</a> in Oxford took up researching and mass-producing it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments. They started mass production after the bombing of <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. By <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> in 1944, enough penicillin had been produced to treat all the wounded in the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a>.

In Oxford, <a href="Ernst%20Boris%20Chain">Ernst Boris Chain</a> and <a href="Edward%20Abraham">Edward Abraham</a> were studying the molecular structure of the antibiotic. Abraham was the first to propose the correct structure of penicillin. Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a>, Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked ""Good God! I thought he was dead.""

<a href="Norman%20Heatley">Norman Heatley</a> suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.

After the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.

Fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the ""Fleming Myth"" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir <a href="Henry%20Harris%20%28scientist%29">Henry Harris</a> said in 1998: "Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin."

Fleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or "penicillium sp." were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals. <a href="Ernest%20Duchesne">Ernest Duchesne</a> in 1897 in his thesis "Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes", or also <a href="Clodomiro%20Picado%20Twight">Clodomiro Picado Twight</a> whose work at Institut Pasteur in 1923 on the inhibiting action of fungi of the "Penicillin sp" genre in the growth of staphylococci drew little interest from the direction of the Institut at the time. Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale. Fleming also discovered very early that <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> developed <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a> whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. <a href="Almroth%20Wright">Almroth Wright</a> had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements "... the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted." He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.

The popular story of <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Winston Churchill's father</a> paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston</a> from death is false. According to the biography, "Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution" by <a href="Kevin%20Brown%20%28historian%20of%20medicine%29">Kevin Brown</a>, Alexander Fleming, in a letter to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia, described this as "A wondrous fable." Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Churchill was saved by <a href="Charles%20Wilson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Moran">Lord Moran</a>, using <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulphonamides</a>, since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> in 1943. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug <a href="sulfapyridine">Sulphapyridine</a>, known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by <a href="May%20%26amp%3B%20Baker">May & Baker Ltd</a>, <a href="Dagenham">Dagenham</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a> – a subsidiary of the French group <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne-Poulenc">Rhône-Poulenc</a>. In a subsequent <a href="radio%20broadcast">radio broadcast</a>, Churchill referred to the new drug as "This admirable M&B". It is highly probable that the correct information about the <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulphonamide</a> did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, <a href="Prontosil">Prontosil</a>, had been a discovery by the German laboratory <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a>, and as Britain was at war with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.

His discovery of penicillin had changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of useful <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s; penicillin has saved, and is still saving, millions of people around the world.

The laboratory at St Mary's Hospital where Fleming discovered penicillin is home to the <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%2C%20London%23Fleming%20Museum">Fleming Museum</a>, a popular London attraction. His alma mater, <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%20Medical%20School">St Mary's Hospital Medical School</a>, merged with <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</a> in 1988. The "Sir Alexander Fleming Building" on the <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a> campus was opened in 1998, where his son Robert and his great granddaughter Claire were presented to the Queen and is now one of the main preclinical teaching sites of the <a href="Imperial%20College%20School%20of%20Medicine">Imperial College School of Medicine</a>.

His other alma mater, the Royal Polytechnic Institution (now the <a href="University%20of%20Westminster">University of Westminster</a>) has named one of its student halls of residence "Alexander Fleming House", which is near to <a href="Old%20Street">Old Street</a>.


On 24 December 1915, Fleming married a trained nurse, Sarah Marion McElroy of <a href="Killala">Killala</a>, <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, Ireland. Their only child, Robert Fleming, (1924-2015) became a <a href="General%20practitioner">general medical practitioner</a>. After his first wife's death in 1949, Fleming married Dr. <a href="Amalia%20Fleming">Amalia Koutsouri-Vourekas</a>, a <a href="Greek%20people">Greek</a> colleague at St. Mary's, on 9 April 1953; she died in 1986.

From 1921 until his death in 1955, Fleming owned a country home in <a href="Barton%20Mills">Barton Mills</a>, Suffolk.

On 11 March 1955, Fleming died at his home in London of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a>. He was buried in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>.
