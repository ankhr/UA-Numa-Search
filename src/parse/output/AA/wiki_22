Astrobiology

Astrobiology is the study of the <a href="abiogenesis">origin</a>, <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, distribution, and future of <a href="life">life</a> in the <a href="universe">universe</a>: <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a> and <a href="Earliest%20known%20life%20forms">life on Earth</a>. Astrobiology addresses the question of whether life exists beyond Earth, and how humans can detect it if it does. The term exobiology is similar but more specific—it covers the search for life beyond Earth, and the effects of extraterrestrial environments on living things.

Astrobiology makes use of <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="biology">biology</a>, <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>, <a href="ecology">ecology</a>, <a href="planetary%20science">planetary science</a>, <a href="geography">geography</a>, and <a href="geology">geology</a> to investigate the possibility of life on other worlds and help recognize <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>s that might be different from that on Earth. <a href="Abiogenesis">The origin</a> and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology. Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing <a href="Scientific%20method">scientific data</a>, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with <a href="hypotheses">hypotheses</a> that fit firmly into existing <a href="Theory%23Science">scientific theories</a>. Given more detailed and reliable data from other parts of the universe, the roots of astrobiology itself—physics, chemistry and biology—may have their theoretical bases challenged.

This <a href="interdisciplinary">interdisciplinary</a> field encompasses research on the origin and evolution of <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>s, origins of <a href="List%20of%20interstellar%20and%20circumstellar%20molecules">organic compounds in space</a>, rock-water-carbon interactions, <a href="abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a> on Earth, <a href="planetary%20habitability">planetary habitability</a>, research on <a href="biosignature">biosignature</a>s for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>.

The <a href="Biochemistry">chemistry of life</a> may have begun shortly after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>, <a href="Age%20of%20the%20universe">13.8 billion years ago</a>, during a habitable epoch when the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> was only 10–17 million years old. According to the <a href="panspermia">panspermia</a> hypothesis, microscopic life—distributed by <a href="meteoroids">meteoroids</a>, <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s and other <a href="Small%20Solar%20System%20body">small Solar System bodies</a>—may exist throughout the universe. According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may be more favorable to the creation and development of <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitable planets</a> than such smaller galaxies as the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Nonetheless, Earth is the only place in the universe humans know to harbor life. Estimates of <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>s around other stars, sometimes referred to as "Goldilocks zones," along with the discovery of hundreds of <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s and new insights into extreme habitats here on Earth, suggest that there may be many more habitable places in the universe than considered possible until very recently.

<a href="Timeline%20of%20Mars%20Science%20Laboratory%23Current%20status">Current studies</a> on the planet <a href="Mars">Mars</a> by the <a href="Curiosity%20%28rover%29">"Curiosity"</a> and <a href="Opportunity%20%28rover%29">"Opportunity"</a> <a href="Mars%20rover">rovers</a> are searching for evidence of ancient life as well as plains related to ancient rivers or lakes that may have been <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitable</a>. The search for evidence of <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a>, <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> (related to <a href="fossils">fossils</a>), and <a href="organic%20molecule">organic molecule</a>s on the planet Mars is now a primary <a href="NASA">NASA</a> and <a href="ESA">ESA</a> objective.

The term was first proposed by the Russian (<a href="Soviet">Soviet</a>) astronomer <a href="Gavriil%20Adrianovich%20Tikhov">Gavriil Tikhov</a> in 1953. "Astrobiology" is etymologically derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> , "astron", "constellation, star"; , "bios", "life"; and , "<a href="wiktionary%3A-logia">-logia</a>", "study". The synonyms of astrobiology are diverse; however, the synonyms were structured in relation to the most important sciences implied in its development: <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="biology">biology</a>. A close synonym is "exobiology" from the Greek , "external"; Βίος, "bios", "life"; and λογία, -logia, "study". The term exobiology was coined by molecular biologist <a href="Joshua%20Lederberg">Joshua Lederberg</a>. Exobiology is considered to have a narrow scope limited to search of life external to Earth, whereas subject area of astrobiology is wider and investigates the link between life and the <a href="universe">universe</a>, which includes the search for extraterrestrial life, but also includes the study of life on Earth, its origin, evolution and limits. 

Another term used in the past is <a href="xenobiology">xenobiology</a>, ("biology of the foreigners") a word used in 1954 by science fiction writer <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a> in his work <a href="The%20Star%20Beast">The Star Beast</a>. The term xenobiology is now used in a more specialized sense, to mean "biology based on foreign chemistry", whether of extraterrestrial or terrestrial (possibly synthetic) origin. Since alternate chemistry analogs to some life-processes have been created in the laboratory, xenobiology is now considered as an extant subject.

While it is an emerging and developing field, the question of whether <a href="life">life</a> exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of <a href="science">scientific</a> inquiry. Though once considered outside the mainstream of scientific inquiry, astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist <a href="David%20Grinspoon">David Grinspoon</a> calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded the <a href="search%20for%20extraterrestrial%20intelligence">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a> (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for <a href="interstellar%20communication">interstellar communication</a>s transmitted by <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a> outside the Solar System. NASA's <a href="Viking%20program">Viking missions</a> to Mars, launched in 1976, included <a href="Viking%20biological%20experiments">three biology experiments</a> designed to look for <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of present <a href="life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a>.

Advancements in the fields of astrobiology, observational astronomy and discovery of large varieties of <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a>s with extraordinary capability to thrive in the harshest environments on Earth, have led to speculation that life may possibly be thriving on many of the extraterrestrial bodies in the universe. A particular focus of current astrobiology research is the search for <a href="life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a> due to this planet's proximity to Earth and geological history. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that Mars has previously had a considerable amount of <a href="Water%20on%20Mars">water on its surface</a>, water being considered an essential precursor to the development of carbon-based life.

Missions specifically designed to search for current life on Mars were the <a href="Viking%20program">Viking program</a> and <a href="Beagle%202">Beagle 2</a> probes. The Viking results were inconclusive, and Beagle 2 failed minutes after landing. A future mission with a strong astrobiology role would have been the <a href="Jupiter%20Icy%20Moons%20Orbiter">Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter</a>, designed to study the frozen moons of Jupiter—some of which may have liquid water—had it not been cancelled. In late 2008, the <a href="Phoenix%20%28spacecraft%29">Phoenix lander</a> probed the environment for past and present <a href="planetary%20habitability">planetary habitability</a> of <a href="microbe">microbial</a> <a href="life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a>, and researched the history of water there.

In November 2011, NASA launched the <a href="Mars%20Science%20Laboratory">Mars Science Laboratory</a> mission carrying the <a href="Curiosity%20rover">"Curiosity"</a> rover, which <a href="Curiosity%20rover%23Landing">landed</a> on Mars at <a href="Gale%20%28crater%29">Gale Crater</a> in August 2012. The "Curiosity" rover is currently probing the environment for past and present <a href="planetary%20habitability">planetary habitability</a> of <a href="microbe">microbial</a> <a href="life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a>. On 9 December 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from "Curiosity" studying <a href="Aeolis%20Palus">Aeolis Palus</a>, <a href="Gale%20%28crater%29">Gale Crater</a> contained an ancient <a href="freshwater%20lake">freshwater lake</a> which could have been a hospitable environment for <a href="microbial%20life">microbial life</a>.

The <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a> is currently collaborating with the <a href="Russian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> (Roscosmos) and developing the <a href="ExoMars">ExoMars</a> astrobiology rover, which is to be launched in 2018. Meanwhile, NASA is developing the <a href="Mars%202020">Mars 2020</a> astrobiology rover and sample cacher for a later return to Earth.

When looking for life on other planets like Earth, some simplifying assumptions are useful to reduce the size of the task of the astrobiologist. One is the informed assumption that the vast majority of life forms in our galaxy are based on <a href="Carbon-based%20life">carbon chemistries</a>, as are all life forms on Earth. Carbon is well known for the unusually wide variety of <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s that can be formed around it. Carbon is the <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">fourth most abundant element</a> in the universe and the energy required to make or break a bond is at just the appropriate level for building molecules which are not only stable, but also reactive. The fact that carbon atoms bond readily to other carbon atoms allows for the building of extremely long and <a href="organic%20compound">complex molecules</a>.

The presence of liquid water is an assumed requirement, as it is a common molecule and provides an excellent environment for the formation of complicated carbon-based molecules that could eventually lead to the <a href="Abiogenesis">emergence of life</a>. Some researchers posit environments of water-<a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> mixtures as possible solvents for <a href="hypothetical%20types%20of%20biochemistry">hypothetical types of biochemistry</a>.

A third assumption is to focus on planets orbiting <a href="Sun">Sun</a>-like <a href="star">star</a>s for increased probabilities of <a href="planetary%20habitability">planetary habitability</a>. Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might not have time to emerge on <a href="planet">planet</a>s orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be <a href="Tidal%20lock">tidally "locked"</a> to the star. The long lifetimes of <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s could allow the development of habitable environments on planets with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See <a href="Habitability%20of%20red%20dwarf%20systems">Habitability of red dwarf systems</a>).

Since Earth is the only planet known to harbor <a href="life">life</a>, there is no evident way to know if any of these simplifying assumptions are correct.

Research on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence (<a href="Communication%20with%20extraterrestrial%20intelligence">CETI</a>) focuses on composing and deciphering messages that could theoretically be understood by another technological civilization. Communication attempts by humans have included broadcasting mathematical languages, pictorial systems such as the <a href="Arecibo%20message">Arecibo message</a> and computational approaches to detecting and deciphering 'natural' language communication. The <a href="SETI">SETI</a> program, for example, uses both <a href="radio%20telescope">radio telescope</a>s and <a href="optical%20telescope">optical telescope</a>s to search for deliberate signals from an <a href="extraterrestrial%20intelligence">extraterrestrial intelligence</a>.

While some high-profile scientists, such as <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, have advocated the transmission of messages, scientist <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> has warned against it, suggesting that aliens might simply raid Earth for its resources and then move on.

Most astronomy-related astrobiology research falls into the category of <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a> (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then it could also arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Terrestrial%20Planet%20Finder">Terrestrial Planet Finder</a> (TPF) and <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">ESA's</a> <a href="Darwin%20%28ESA%29">Darwin</a> programs, both of which have been cancelled. NASA launched the <a href="Kepler%20%28spacecraft%29">"Kepler" mission</a> in March 2009, and the <a href="French%20Space%20Agency">French Space Agency</a> launched the <a href="COROT">COROT</a> space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.

The goal of these missions is not only to detect Earth-sized planets, but also to directly detect light from the planet so that it may be studied <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopically</a>. By examining planetary spectra, it would be possible to determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.

An estimate for the number of planets with intelligent "communicative" <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a> can be gleaned from the <a href="Drake%20equation">Drake equation</a>, essentially an equation expressing the probability of intelligent life as the product of factors such as the fraction of planets that might be habitable and the fraction of planets on which life might arise:
where:

However, whilst the rationale behind the equation is sound, it is unlikely that the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support <a href="hypothesis">hypotheses</a> because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, "f", stars with planets and "f", planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or <a href="pseudoscientific">pseudoscientific</a> arguments. Another associated topic is the <a href="Fermi%20paradox">Fermi paradox</a>, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the <a href="universe">universe</a>, then there should be obvious signs of it.

Another active research area in astrobiology is <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> formation. It has been suggested that the peculiarities of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> (for example, the presence of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> as a protective shield) may have greatly increased the probability of intelligent life arising on our planet.

Biology cannot state that a process or phenomenon, by being mathematically possible, has to exist forcibly in an extraterrestrial body. Biologists specify what is speculative and what is not.

Until the 1970s, <a href="life">life</a> was thought to be entirely dependent on energy from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Plants on Earth's surface capture energy from <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a> to <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesize</a> sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen in the process that is then consumed by oxygen-respiring organisms, passing their energy up the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was thought to obtain its nourishment either from consuming <a href="marine%20snow">organic detritus rained down from the surface waters</a> or from eating animals that did. The world's ability to support life was thought to depend on its access to <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a>. However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the <a href="Galapagos%20Rift">Galapagos Rift</a> in the deep-sea exploration submersible "<a href="DSV%20Alvin">Alvin</a>", scientists discovered colonies of <a href="giant%20tube%20worm">giant tube worm</a>s, <a href="clam">clam</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s, and other assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as <a href="black%20smoker">black smoker</a>s. These creatures thrive despite having no access to sunlight, and it was soon discovered that they comprise an entirely independent <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Although most of these multicellular lifeforms need dissolved oxygen (produced by oxygenic photosynthesis) for their aerobic cellular respiration and thus are not completely independent from sunlight by themselves, the basis for their food chain is a form of <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a> that derives its energy from <a href="Redox">oxidization</a> of reactive chemicals, such as <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> or <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a>, that bubble up from the Earth's interior. Other lifeforms entirely decoupled from the energy from sunlight are green sulphur bacteria which are capturing geothermal light for anoxygenic photosynthesis or bacteria running chemolithoautotrophy based on the radioactive decay of uranium. This <a href="chemosynthesis">chemosynthesis</a> revolutionized the study of biology and astrobiology by revealing that life need not be sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

<a href="Extremophiles">Extremophiles</a>, organisms able to survive in extreme environments, are a core research element for astrobiologists. Such organisms include <a href="Biota%20%28ecology%29">biota</a> which are able to survive several kilometers below the ocean's surface near <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a>s and <a href="microbe">microbe</a>s that thrive in highly acidic environments. It is now known that extremophiles thrive in ice, boiling water, acid, alkali, the water core of nuclear reactors, salt crystals, toxic waste and in a range of other extreme habitats that were previously thought to be inhospitable for life. This opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible extraterrestrial habitats. Characterization of these organisms, their environments and their evolutionary pathways, is considered a crucial component to understanding how life might evolve elsewhere in the universe. For example, some organisms able to withstand exposure to the vacuum and radiation of outer space include the lichen fungi "<a href="Rhizocarpon%20geographicum">Rhizocarpon geographicum</a>" and "<a href="Xanthoria%20elegans">Xanthoria elegans</a>", the bacterium "<a href="Bacillus%20safensis">Bacillus safensis</a>", "<a href="Deinococcus%20radiodurans">Deinococcus radiodurans</a>", "<a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>", yeast "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>", seeds from "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" ('mouse-ear cress'), as well as the invertebrate animal <a href="Tardigrade">Tardigrade</a>.

Jupiter's moon, <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a>, and Saturn's moon, <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, are now considered the most likely locations for extant extraterrestrial life in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> due to their <a href="Subsurface%20ocean%23Extraterrestrial%20oceans">subsurface water oceans</a> where radiogenic and tidal heating enables liquid water to exist.

The origin of life, known as <a href="abiogenesis">abiogenesis</a>, distinct from the <a href="Evolution%23Evolution%20of%20life">evolution of life</a>, is another ongoing field of research. <a href="Oparin">Oparin</a> and <a href="J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">Haldane</a> postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive to the formation of <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s from <a href="inorganic%20chemistry">inorganic elements</a> and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of <a href="panspermia">panspermia</a> is that the first elements of life may have formed on another planet with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the <a href="panspermia">panspermia</a> hypothesis.

The <a href="cosmic%20dust">cosmic dust</a> permeating the universe contains complex <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a>-<a href="aliphatic">aliphatic</a> structure") that could be created naturally, and rapidly, by <a href="stars">stars</a>. Further, a scientist suggested that these compounds may have been related to the development of life on Earth and said that, "If this is the case, life on Earth may have had an easier time getting started as these organics can serve as basic ingredients for life." In September 2012, NASA scientists reported that <a href="polycyclic%20aromatic%20hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)</a>, subjected to <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> conditions, are transformed through <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, <a href="oxygenation%20%28environmental%29">oxygenation</a> and <a href="hydroxylation">hydroxylation</a>, to more complex <a href="organic%20compound">organics</a> – "a step along the path toward <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s and <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s, the raw materials of <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, respectively".

More than 20% of the <a href="carbon">carbon</a> in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible <a href="PAH%20world%20hypothesis">starting materials</a> for the <a href="Abiogenesis%23PAH%20world%20hypothesis">formation</a> of <a href="Life%23Extraterrestrial%20life">life</a>. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with <a href="Star%20formation">new stars</a> and <a href="exoplanets">exoplanets</a>.

<a href="Astroecology">Astroecology</a> concerns the interactions of life with space environments and resources, in <a href="planets">planets</a>, <a href="asteroids">asteroids</a> and <a href="comets">comets</a>. On a larger scale, astroecology concerns resources for life about <a href="stars">stars</a> in the <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a> through the cosmological future. Astroecology attempts to quantify future life in space, addressing this area of astrobiology.

Experimental astroecology investigates resources in planetary soils, using actual space materials in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s. The results suggest that Martian and carbonaceous chondrite materials can support <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="algae">algae</a> and plant (asparagus, potato) cultures, with high soil fertilities. The results support that life could have survived in early aqueous asteroids and on similar materials imported to Earth by dust, comets and meteorites, and that such asteroid materials can be used as soil for future space colonies.

On the largest scale, cosmoecology concerns life in the universe over cosmological times. The main sources of energy may be red giant stars and white and red dwarf stars, sustaining life for 10 years. Astroecologists suggest that their mathematical models may quantify the potential amounts of future life in space, allowing a comparable expansion in biodiversity, potentially leading to diverse intelligent life forms.

<a href="Geology%20of%20solar%20terrestrial%20planets">Astrogeology</a> is a <a href="planetary%20science">planetary science</a> discipline concerned with the <a href="geology">geology</a> of <a href="celestial%20bodies">celestial bodies</a> such as the <a href="planet">planet</a>s and their <a href="moon">moon</a>s, <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s, <a href="comet">comet</a>s, and <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s. The information gathered by this discipline allows the measure of a <a href="planet">planet</a>'s or a <a href="natural%20satellite">natural satellite</a>'s potential to develop and sustain <a href="life">life</a>, or <a href="planetary%20habitability">planetary habitability</a>.

An additional discipline of astrogeology is <a href="geochemistry">geochemistry</a>, which involves study of the <a href="chemistry">chemical</a> composition of the Earth and other <a href="planet">planet</a>s, chemical processes and reactions that govern the composition of <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a>s and <a href="soil">soil</a>s, the cycles of matter and energy and their interaction with the <a href="hydrosphere">hydrosphere</a> and the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> of the planet. Specializations include <a href="cosmochemistry">cosmochemistry</a>, <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a> and <a href="organic%20geochemistry">organic geochemistry</a>.

The <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> provides the oldest known evidence for life on Earth. By examining the fossil evidence, <a href="paleontologists">paleontologists</a> are able to better understand the types of organisms that arose on the early Earth. Some regions on Earth, such as the <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a> in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and the <a href="McMurdo%20Dry%20Valleys">McMurdo Dry Valleys</a> of Antarctica, are also considered to be geological analogs to regions of Mars, and as such, might be able to provide clues on how to search for past <a href="life%20on%20Mars">life on Mars</a>.

The various organic functional groups, composed of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and a host of metals, such as iron, magnesium, and zinc, provide the enormous diversity of chemical reactions necessarily catalyzed by a living <a href="organism">organism</a>. Silicon, in contrast, interacts with only a few other atoms, and the large silicon molecules are monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules. Indeed, it seems likely that the basic building blocks of life anywhere will be similar those on Earth, in the generality if not in the detail. Although terrestrial life and life that might arise independently of Earth are expected to use many similar, if not identical, building blocks, they also are expected to have some biochemical qualities that are unique. If life has had a comparable impact elsewhere in the Solar System, the relative abundances of chemicals key for its survival – whatever they may be – could betray its presence. Whatever extraterrestrial life may be, its tendency to chemically alter its environment might just give it away.

People have long speculated about the possibility of life in settings other than Earth, however, speculation on the nature of life elsewhere often has paid little heed to constraints imposed by the nature of biochemistry. The likelihood that life throughout the universe is probably carbon-based is suggested by the fact that carbon is one of the most abundant of the higher elements. Only two of the natural atoms, <a href="carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, are known to serve as the backbones of molecules sufficiently large to carry biological information. As the structural basis for life, one of carbon's important features is that unlike silicon, it can readily engage in the formation of chemical bonds with many other atoms, thereby allowing for the chemical versatility required to conduct the reactions of biological metabolism and propagation.

Thought on where in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> life might occur, was limited historically by the understanding that life relies ultimately on light and warmth from the Sun and, therefore, is restricted to the surfaces of planets. The three most likely candidates for life in the Solar System are the planet <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, the Jovian moon <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a>, and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moons <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>, and <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>.

<a href="Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="Enceladus%20%28moon%29">Enceladus</a> and <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a> are considered likely candidates in the search for life primarily because they may have underground liquid water, a molecule essential for life as we know it for its use as a <a href="solvent">solvent</a> in cells. Water on Mars is found frozen in its polar ice caps, and newly carved gullies recently observed on Mars suggest that liquid water may exist, at least transiently, on the planet's surface. At the Martian low temperatures and low pressure, liquid water is likely to be highly saline. As for Europa, liquid water likely exists beneath the moon's icy outer crust. This water may be warmed to a liquid state by volcanic vents on the ocean floor, but the primary source of heat is probably <a href="tidal%20heating">tidal heating</a>. On 11 December 2013, NASA reported the detection of "<a href="Clay%20minerals">clay-like minerals</a>" (specifically, <a href="phyllosilicates">phyllosilicates</a>), often associated with <a href="organic%20materials">organic materials</a>, on the icy crust of <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a>. The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> or <a href="comet">comet</a> according to the scientists.

Another <a href="List%20of%20planetary%20bodies">planetary body</a> that could potentially sustain extraterrestrial life is <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s largest moon, <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>. Titan has been described as having conditions similar to those of early <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. On its surface, scientists have discovered the first liquid lakes outside Earth, but these lakes seem to be composed of <a href="ethane">ethane</a> and/or <a href="methane">methane</a>, not water. Some scientists think it possible that these liquid <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s might take the place of water in <a href="Hypothetical%20types%20of%20biochemistry">living cells different from those on Earth</a>. After Cassini data was studied, it was reported on March 2008 that Titan may also have an underground ocean composed of liquid <a href="water">water</a> and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. Additionally, Saturn's moon <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a> may have an ocean below its icy surface and, according to NASA scientists in May 2011, "is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it".

Measuring the ratio of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="methane">methane</a> levels on Mars may help determine the likelihood of <a href="life%20on%20Mars">life on Mars</a>. According to the scientists, "...low H/CH ratios (less than approximately 40) indicate that life is likely present and active." Other scientists have recently reported methods of detecting hydrogen and methane in <a href="extraterrestrial%20atmospheres">extraterrestrial atmospheres</a>.

Complex <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s of life, including <a href="uracil">uracil</a>, <a href="cytosine">cytosine</a> and <a href="thymine">thymine</a>, have been formed in a laboratory under <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a> conditions, using starting chemicals such as <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a>, found in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s. Pyrimidine, like <a href="polycyclic%20aromatic%20hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</a>s (PAHs), is the most carbon-rich chemical found in <a href="universe">the universe</a>.

The Rare Earth hypothesis postulates that multicellular life forms found on Earth may actually be more of a rarity than scientists assume. It provides a possible answer to the Fermi paradox which suggests, "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?" It is apparently in opposition to the <a href="principle%20of%20mediocrity">principle of mediocrity</a>, assumed by famed astronomers <a href="Frank%20Drake">Frank Drake</a>, <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, and others. The Principle of Mediocrity suggests that life on Earth is not exceptional, but rather that life is more than likely to be found on innumerable other worlds.

The <a href="anthropic%20principle">anthropic principle</a> states that fundamental laws of the universe work specifically in a way that life would be possible. The anthropic principle supports the Rare Earth Hypothesis by arguing the overall elements that are needed to support life on Earth are so fine-tuned that it is nearly impossible for another just like it to exist by random chance.

The systematic search for possible life outside Earth is a valid multidisciplinary scientific endeavor. However, hypotheses and predictions as to its existence and origin vary widely, and at the present, the development of hypotheses firmly grounded on science may be considered astrobiology's most concrete practical application. It has been proposed that <a href="viruses">viruses</a> are likely to be encountered on other life-bearing planets.

, no evidence of extraterrestrial life has been identified. Examination of the <a href="Allan%20Hills%2084001">Allan Hills 84001</a> meteorite, which was recovered in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> in 1984 and originated from <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, is thought by <a href="David%20S.%20McKay">David McKay</a>, as well as few other scientists, to contain <a href="Fossil%23Microfossils">microfossils</a> of extraterrestrial origin; this interpretation is controversial.

<a href="Yamato%20000593">Yamato 000593</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Martian%20meteorites%23List">second largest</a> <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a> from <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, was found on Earth in 2000. At a microscopic level, <a href="Martian%20spherules">spheres</a> are found in the meteorite that are rich in <a href="carbon">carbon</a> compared to surrounding areas that lack such spheres. The carbon-rich spheres may have been formed by <a href="biotic%20material">biotic activity</a> according to some NASA scientists.

On 5 March 2011, <a href="Richard%20B.%20Hoover">Richard B. Hoover</a>, a scientist with the <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a>, speculated on the finding of alleged microfossils similar to <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> in <a href="CI1%20fossils">CI1</a> carbonaceous <a href="meteorites">meteorites</a> in the <a href="fringe%20science">fringe</a> "<a href="Journal%20of%20Cosmology">Journal of Cosmology</a>", a story widely reported on by <a href="mainstream%20media">mainstream media</a>. However, NASA formally distanced itself from Hoover's claim. According to American astrophysicist <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>: "At the moment, life on Earth is the only known life in the universe, but there are compelling arguments to suggest we are not alone."


On 17 March 2013, researchers reported that <a href="microbes">microbial life forms</a> thrive in the <a href="Mariana%20Trench">Mariana Trench</a>, the deepest spot on the Earth. Other researchers reported that microbes thrive inside rocks up to below the sea floor under of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States. According to one of the researchers, "You can find microbes everywhere—they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are." These finds expand the potential habitability of certain niches of other planets.

In 2004, the spectral signature of <a href="methane">methane</a> () was detected in the Martian atmosphere by both Earth-based telescopes as well as by the <a href="Mars%20Express">Mars Express</a> orbiter. Because of <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a> and <a href="cosmic%20radiation">cosmic radiation</a>, methane is predicted to disappear from the Martian atmosphere within several years, so the gas must be actively replenished in order to maintain the present concentration. The <a href="Curiosity%20%28rover%29">"Curiosity"</a> rover will perform precision measurements of oxygen and carbon <a href="isotope">isotope</a> ratios in carbon dioxide (CO) and methane (CH) in the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20mars%23Methane">atmosphere of Mars</a> in order to distinguish between a <a href="Geochemistry">geochemical</a> and a <a href="biology">biological</a> origin.

It is possible that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time will undoubtedly discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's <a href="Kepler%20Mission">Kepler Mission</a> seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a> as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in <a href="infrared%20astronomy">infrared astronomy</a> and <a href="submillimeter%20astronomy">submillimeter astronomy</a> has revealed the constituents of other <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s.


Efforts to answer questions such as the abundance of potentially habitable planets in <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>s and chemical precursors have had much success. Numerous <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s have been detected using the <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">wobble method</a> and <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20exoplanets%23Transit%20photometry">transit method</a>, showing that planets around other <a href="star">star</a>s are more numerous than previously postulated. The first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be discovered within its star's habitable zone is <a href="Gliese%20581%20c">Gliese 581 c</a>.

Research into the environmental limits of life and the workings of extreme <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s is ongoing, enabling researchers to better predict what planetary environments might be most likely to harbor life. Missions such as the <a href="Phoenix%20%28spacecraft%29">"Phoenix" lander</a>, <a href="Mars%20Science%20Laboratory">Mars Science Laboratory</a>, <a href="ExoMars">ExoMars</a>, <a href="Mars%202020">Mars 2020</a> rover to Mars, and the <a href="Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens">"Cassini" probe</a> to <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moons aim to further explore the possibilities of life on other planets in the Solar System.

The two <a href="Viking%20program">Viking landers</a> each carried four types of biological experiments to the surface of Mars in the late 1970s. These were the only Mars landers to carry out experiments looking specifically for <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> by current microbial <a href="Life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a>. The landers used a robotic arm to collect soil samples into sealed test containers on the craft. The two landers were identical, so the same tests were carried out at two places on Mars' surface; <a href="Viking%201">Viking 1</a> near the equator and <a href="Viking%202">Viking 2</a> further north. The result was inconclusive, and is still disputed by some scientists.

"Beagle 2" was an unsuccessful <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> Mars lander that formed part of the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>'s 2003 <a href="Mars%20Express">Mars Express</a> mission. Its primary purpose was to search for signs of <a href="life%20on%20Mars">life on Mars</a>, past or present. Although it landed safely, it was unable to correctly deploy its solar panels and telecom antenna.

<a href="EXPOSE">EXPOSE</a> is a multi-user facility mounted in 2008 outside the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> dedicated to astrobiology. EXPOSE was developed by the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a> (ESA) for <a href="Spaceflight">long-term spaceflights</a> that allow exposure of <a href="organic%20chemical">organic chemical</a>s and biological samples to <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a> in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>.

The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed the <a href="Curiosity%20%28rover%29">"Curiosity"</a> <a href="Rover%20%28space%20exploration%29">rover</a> that is currently in operation on <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. It was launched 26 November 2011, and landed at <a href="Gale%20%28crater%29">Gale Crater</a> on 6 August 2012. Mission objectives are to help assess Mars' <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a> and in doing so, determine whether Mars is or has ever been able to support <a href="Life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life</a>, collect data for a future <a href="Human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human mission</a>, study Martian geology, its climate, and further assess the role that <a href="Water%20on%20Mars">water</a>, an essential ingredient for life as we know it, played in forming minerals on Mars.

ExoMars is a robotic mission to Mars to search for possible <a href="biosignature">biosignature</a>s of <a href="Life%20on%20Mars">Martian life</a>, past or present. This astrobiological mission is currently under development by the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a> (ESA) in partnership with the <a href="Russian%20Federal%20Space%20Agency">Russian Federal Space Agency</a> (Roscosmos); it is planned for a 2018 launch.

The 'Mars 2020' rover mission is a concept under development by NASA with a possible launch in 2020. It is intended to investigate environments on Mars relevant to astrobiology, investigate its surface <a href="Geology%20of%20Mars">geological processes</a> and history, including the assessment of its past <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a> and potential for preservation of <a href="biosignature">biosignature</a>s and <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s within accessible geological materials. The Science Definition Team is proposing the rover collect and package at least 31 samples of rock cores and soil for a later mission to bring back for more definitive analysis in laboratories on Earth. The rover could make measurements and technology demonstrations to help designers of a <a href="Human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human expedition</a> understand any hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how to collect <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO), which could be a resource for making molecular oxygen (O) and <a href="rocket%20fuel">rocket fuel</a>.

Europa Clipper is a mission planned by NASA for a 2025 launch that will conduct detailed reconnaissance of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s moon <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a> and will investigate whether the icy moon could harbor conditions suitable for life. It will also aid in the selection of future <a href="Lander%20%28spacecraft%29">landing sites</a>.

"Icebreaker Life" is a lander mission that proposed for NASA's <a href="Discovery%20Program">Discovery Program</a> for the 2021 launch opportunity, but it was not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 <a href="Phoenix%20%28spacecraft%29">"Phoenix"</a> and it would have carried an upgraded astrobiology scientific payload, including a 1-meter-long core drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for <a href="organic%20molecule">organic molecule</a>s and evidence of current or past <a href="life%20on%20Mars">life on Mars</a>. One of the key goals of the "Icebreaker Life" mission is to test the <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from <a href="Oxidizing%20agent">oxidants</a> and <a href="Sunlight">radiation</a>.

<a href="Journey%20to%20Enceladus%20and%20Titan">Journey to Enceladus and Titan</a> (JET) is an orbiter astrobiology mission concept to assess the <a href="planetary%20habitability">habitability</a> potential of <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s moons <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a> and <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>.

<a href="Enceladus%20Life%20Finder">Enceladus Life Finder</a> (ELF) is a proposed astrobiology mission concept for a space probe intended to assess the <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a> of the <a href="Extraterrestrial%20liquid%20water%23Enceladus">internal aquatic ocean</a> of <a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>'s <a href="moons%20of%20Saturn">sixth-largest moon</a>.

<a href="Life%20Investigation%20For%20Enceladus">Life Investigation For Enceladus</a> (LIFE) is a proposed astrobiology sample-return mission concept. The spacecraft would enter into <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> orbit and enable multiple flybys through Enceladus' icy plumes to collect icy plume particles and volatiles and return them to Earth on a capsule. The spacecraft may sample Enceladus' plumes, the <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn%23E%20Ring">E ring of Saturn</a>, and the upper atmosphere of <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>.

Red Dragon is a proposed series low-cost Mars <a href="Lander%20%28spacecraft%29">lander</a> missions that would utilize the <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> <a href="Falcon%20Heavy">Falcon Heavy</a> launch vehicle, and a modified <a href="Dragon%20V2">Dragon V2</a> capsule to <a href="Atmospheric%20entry">enter</a> the <a href="Martian%20atmosphere">Martian atmosphere</a> and land using <a href="retrorockets">retrorockets</a>. The lander's primary mission would be a technology demonstration, and to search for evidence of <a href="Life%20on%20Mars%20%28planet%29">life on Mars</a> (<a href="biosignature">biosignature</a>s), past or present. The concept had been meant to compete for funding on 2012/2013 as a <a href="Discovery%20Program">NASA Discovery mission</a>.

"Oceanus" is an orbiter proposed in 2017 for the <a href="New%20Frontiers%20program">New Frontiers</a> mission #4. It would travel to the moon of <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> - <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a>, to assess its <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a>. "Oceanus" objectives are to reveal Titan's <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, geology, gravity, topography, collect 3D reconnaissance data, catalog the <a href="Organic%20compound">organics</a> and determine where they may interact with liquid water.

"Explorer of Enceladus and Titan" is an orbiter mission concept that would investigate the evolution and <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a> of the Saturnian satellites <a href="Enceladus%20%28moon%29">Enceladus</a> and <a href="Titan%20%28moon%29">Titan</a> and was proposed in 2017 by the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>.

Air show

An air show, (also airshow, air fair, or air tattoo) is a public event at which <a href="aviator">aviator</a>s display their flying skills and the capabilities of their <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> to spectators, usually by means of <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a>. Air shows without aerobatic displays, having only aircraft displayed parked on the ground, are called "static air shows".

In the United States, some of the larger airshows are headlined by military jet demonstration teams including the <a href="U.S.%20Navy%20Blue%20Angels">U.S. Navy Blue Angels</a> and <a href="USAF%20Thunderbirds">USAF Thunderbirds</a>. The <a href="Canadian%20Forces%20Snowbirds">Canadian Forces Snowbirds</a> will headline many airshows in Canada and the United States.

Some airshows are held as a business venture or as a trade event where aircraft, avionics and other services are promoted to potential customers. Many air shows are held in support of local, national or military charities. <a href="Military">Military</a> air firms often organise air shows at military airfields as a public relations exercise to thank the local community, promote military careers and raise the profile of the military.

Air "seasons" vary around the world. The United States enjoys a long season that generally runs from March to November, covering the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Other countries often have much shorter seasons. In Japan air shows are generally events held at <a href="Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a> bases regularly throughout the year. The European season usually starts in late April or Early May and is usually over by mid October. The <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> hold their events between January and March. However, for many acts, the "off-season" does not mean a period of inactivity; pilots and performers use this time for maintenance and practice.

The type of displays seen at an are constrained by a number of factors, including the weather and visibility. Most aviation authorities now publish rules and guidance on minimum display heights and criteria for differing conditions. In addition to the weather, pilots and organizers must also consider local airspace restrictions. Most exhibitors will plan "full," "rolling" and "flat" display for varying weather and airspace conditions.

The types of shows vary greatly. Some are large scale military events with large flying displays and ground exhibitions while others held at small local airstrips can often feature just one or two hours of flying with just a few <a href="%3Awikt%3Astall">stall</a>s on the ground. Air Displays can be held during day or night with the latter becoming increasingly popular. Shows don't always take place over airfields; some have been held over the grounds of stately homes or castles and over the sea at coastal resorts.

The first public international airshow, at which many types of aircraft were displayed and flown, was the <a href="Grande%20Semaine%20d%27Aviation%20de%20la%20Champagne">Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne</a>, which was held Aug. 22-29, 1909 in Reims. This had been preceded by what may have been the first ever gathering of enthusiasts, June 28-July 19 of the same year at the airfield at La Brayelle, near Douai.

Before the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, air shows were associated with long distance air races, often lasting many days and covering thousands of miles. While the <a href="Reno%20Air%20Races">Reno Air Races</a> keep this tradition alive, most air shows today primarily feature a series of aerial demos of short duration.

Most air shows feature <a href="warbird">warbird</a>s, aerobatics, and demonstrations of modern military aircraft, and many air shows offer a variety of other aeronautical attractions as well, such as wing-walking, radio-controlled aircraft, water/slurry drops from firefighting aircraft, simulated helicopter rescues and <a href="sky%20diving">sky diving</a>.

Specialist aerobatic aircraft have powerful piston engines, light weight and big control surfaces, making them capable of very high roll rates and accelerations. A skilled pilot will be able to climb vertically, perform very tight turns, tumble his aircraft end-over-end and perform manoeuvres during loops.

Solo military jet demos, also known as tactical demo, feature one aircraft, usually a strike fighter or an advanced trainer. The demonstration focuses on the capabilities of modern aircraft used in combat operations. The display will usually demonstrate the aircraft's very short (and often very loud) rolls, fast speeds, slow approach speeds, as well as their ability to quickly make tight turns, to climb quickly, and their ability to be precisely controlled at a large range of speeds. Manoeuvres include aileron rolls, barrel rolls, hesitation rolls, Cuban-8s, tight turns, high-alpha flight, a high-speed pass, double Immelmans, and touch-and-gos. Tactical demos may include simulated bomb drops, sometimes with pyrotechnics on the ground for effect. Aircraft with special characteristics that give them unique capabilities will often display those in their demos; For example, Russian fighters with <a href="Thrust%20vectoring">Thrust vectoring</a> may be used to perform <a href="Pugachev%27s%20Cobra">Pugachev's Cobra</a> or the <a href="Kulbit">Kulbit</a>, among other difficult manoeuvers that cannot be performed by other aircraft. Similarly, an <a href="F-22">F-22</a> pilot may hover his jet in the air with the nose pointed straight up, a <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harrier</a> or <a href="V-22">Osprey</a> pilot may perform a vertical landing or vertical takeoff, and so on.

Air shows may present some risk to spectators and aviators. Accidents have occurred, sometimes with a large loss of life, such as the <a href="Ramstein%20airshow%20disaster">1988 disaster at Ramstein Air Base</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="Sknyliv%20airshow%20disaster">2002 air show crash at Lviv</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Because of these accidents, the various aviation authorities around the world have created set rules and guidance for those running and participating in air displays. Air displays are often monitored by aviation authorities to ensure safe procedures.

In the United Kingdom, local authorities will first need to approve any application for an event to which the public is admitted. No approval, no event. The first priority must be to arrange insurance cover and details can be obtained from your local authority. An added complication is a whole new raft of legislation concerning Health & Safety in particular Corporate Manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event. If this very basic step isn't completed then any further activity should be halted until it is.

Rules govern the distance from the crowds that aircraft must fly. These vary according to the rating of the pilot/crew, the type of aircraft and the way the aircraft is being flown. For instance, slower lighter aircraft are usually allowed closer and lower to the crowd than larger, faster types. Also, a fighter jet flying straight and level will be able to do so closer to the crowd and lower than if it were performing a roll or a loop.

Pilots can get authorizations for differing types of displays (i.e. limbo flying, basic aerobatics to unlimited aerobatics) and to differing minimum base heights above the ground. To gain such authorizations, the pilots will have to demonstrate to an examiner that they can perform to those limits without endangering themselves, ground crew or spectators.

Despite display rules and guidances, accidents have continued to happen. However, air show accidents are rare and where there is proper supervision air shows have impressive safety records. Each year, organizations such as <a href="http%3A//www.airshows.aero">International Council of Air Shows</a> and <a href="European%20Airshow%20Council">European Airshow Council</a> meet and discuss various subjects including air show safety where accidents are discussed and lessons learned.

<doc id="2792" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792" title="Anthropic principle">
Anthropic principle

The anthropic principle is a <a href="philosophy">philosophical consideration</a> that observations of the <a href="Universe">Universe</a> must be compatible with the <a href="consciousness">conscious</a> and <a href="sapience">sapient</a> <a href="life">life</a> that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age</a> and the <a href="dimensionless%20physical%20constant">fundamental physical constant</a>s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the <a href="Fine-tuned%20Universe">narrow range thought to be compatible with life</a>.
The strong anthropic principle (SAP) as explained by <a href="John%20D.%20Barrow">John D. Barrow</a> and <a href="Frank%20Tipler">Frank Tipler</a> states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life <a href="emergence">emerge</a> within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a weak anthropic principle (WAP) similar to the one defined by <a href="Brandon%20Carter">Brandon Carter</a>, which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of <a href="selection%20bias">selection bias</a> (specifically <a href="survivor%20bias">survivor bias</a>): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting upon fine tuning. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a> for there to be a <a href="statistical%20population">statistical population</a> of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of "only" this universe, compatible with "our" life) could occur.

The principle was formulated as a response to a <a href="Fine-tuned%20Universe">series of observations</a> that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. The anthropic principle states that this is a <a href="a%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">necessity</a>, because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe "some" universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term "<a href="wikt%3Aanthropic">anthropic</a>" in "anthropic principle" has been argued to be a <a href="misnomer">misnomer</a>. While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require <a href="human">human</a> life or some kind of <a href="carbon%20chauvinism">carbon chauvinism</a>. Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a> and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist", is "easy" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautology</a> or <a href="truism">truism</a>. However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.

In 1961, <a href="Robert%20Dicke">Robert Dicke</a> noted that the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>, as seen by living observers, cannot be random. Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old. If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
<a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> (levels of elements besides <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium">helium</a>) especially <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, by <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a>. Small rocky planets did not yet exist. If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> and would have turned into <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s, aside from the dimmest <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired <a href="Dirac%20large%20numbers%20hypothesis">Dirac's varying-G theory</a>.

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the <a href="Friedmann%20equations%23Density%20parameter">critical density</a> needed to prevent the <a href="Big%20Crunch">Big Crunch</a> (the "Dicke coincidences" <a href="argument">argument</a>). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of <a href="baryon">baryon</a>ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a <a href="Cosmological%20constant%20problem">cosmological constant</a>. <a href="Steven%20Weinberg">Steven Weinberg</a> gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> smaller than the value <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> predicts (this has been described as the "worst prediction in physics"). However, if the cosmological constant were only one order of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic <a href="Cosmic%20inflation">inflation</a>, which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the <a href="dimensionless%20physical%20constant">dimensionless physical constant</a>s (such as the <a href="fine-structure%20constant">fine-structure constant</a>) governing the four <a href="fundamental%20interaction">fundamental interaction</a>s are balanced as if <a href="fine-tuned%20universe">fine-tuned</a> to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a> would bind the <a href="dineutron">dineutron</a> and the <a href="diproton">diproton</a>, and <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

The phrase "anthropic principle" first appeared in <a href="Brandon%20Carter">Brandon Carter</a>'s contribution to a 1973 <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> <a href="symposium">symposium</a> honouring <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Copernicus's</a> 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the <a href="Copernican%20Principle">Copernican Principle</a>, which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the <a href="Universe">Universe</a>. As Carter said: "Although our situation is not necessarily "central", it is inevitably privileged to some extent." Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the <a href="Perfect%20Cosmological%20Principle">Perfect Cosmological Principle</a>, which states that all large regions "and times" in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the <a href="steady-state%20theory">steady-state theory</a>, which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a "weak" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> locations in the universe, and a more controversial "strong" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

<a href="Roger%20Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> explained the weak form as follows:

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make "predictions" about the parameters. But second, "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into "explanations" by assuming that there "is" more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a> ("world ensemble" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a <a href="selection%20effect">selection effect</a>, exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: "why do the <a href="list%20of%20laws%20of%20science">fundamental laws of physics</a> take the particular form we observe and not another?"

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term "anthropic principle" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book "The Anthropic Cosmological Principle" by <a href="John%20D.%20Barrow">John D. Barrow</a> and <a href="Frank%20Tipler">Frank Tipler</a>, published that year which distinguished between "weak" and "strong" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the <a href="evolutionary%20biologist">evolutionary biologist</a> <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: "Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man." In 1957, <a href="Robert%20Dicke">Robert Dicke</a> wrote: "The age of the Universe 'now' is not random but conditioned by biological factors [...] [changes in the values of the fundamental constants of physics] would preclude the existence of man to consider the problem."

Weak anthropic principle (WAP) (<a href="Brandon%20Carter">Carter</a>): "[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is "necessarily" privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers." Note that for Carter, "location" refers to our location in time as well as space.

Strong anthropic principle (SAP) (Carter): "[T]he universe (and hence the <a href="Dimensionless%20physical%20constant">fundamental parameters</a> on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a>, "cogito ergo mundus talis est"."<br>The Latin tag ("I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]") makes it clear that "must" indicates a <a href="deductive%20reasoning">deduction</a> from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a <a href="truism">truism</a>.

In their 1986 book, "The Anthropic Cosmological Principle", <a href="John%20D.%20Barrow">John Barrow</a> and <a href="Frank%20Tipler">Frank Tipler</a> depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:

Weak anthropic principle (WAP) (Barrow and Tipler): "The observed values of all physical and <a href="cosmological">cosmological</a> quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where <a href="carbon-based%20life">carbon-based life</a> can <a href="evolution">evolve</a> and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."<br>Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the <a href="fine%20structure%20constant">fine structure constant</a>, the number of <a href="Spacetime%23Privileged%20character%20of%203%2B1%20spacetime">spacetime dimensions</a>, and the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>—topics that fall under Carter's SAP.

Strong anthropic principle (SAP) (Barrow and Tipler): "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history."<br>This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the "must" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:

The <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>s <a href="John%20Andrew%20Leslie">John Leslie</a> and <a href="Nick%20Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a> reject the Barrow and Tipler SAP as a fundamental misreading of Carter. For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for "anthropic bias"—that is, the bias created by anthropic <a href="selection%20effect">selection effect</a>s (which Bostrom calls "observation" selection effects)—the necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

<a href="Self-sampling%20assumption">Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)</a> (<a href="Nick%20Bostrom">Bostrom</a>): "Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its <a href="reference%20class">reference class</a>."<br> Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of "observer-moments" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Schmidhuber">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a>, the anthropic principle essentially just says that the <a href="conditional%20probability">conditional probability</a> of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as "gravity won't change tomorrow". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the <a href="prior%20distribution">prior distribution</a> of <a href="multiverse">alternative universes</a> are necessary.

Playwright and novelist <a href="Michael%20Frayn">Michael Frayn</a> describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book "The Human Touch", which explores what he characterises as "the central oddity of the Universe":

Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the "fundamental parameters"—that is, the <a href="dimensionless%20physical%20constant">dimensionless physical constant</a>s and initial conditions for the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is <a href="fine-tuned%20universe">fine tuned</a> to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions". If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the "typical" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the <a href="many-worlds%20interpretation">many-worlds interpretation</a> of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by <a href="Max%20Tegmark">Max Tegmark</a>. An important development in the 1980s was the combination of <a href="inflation%20theory">inflation theory</a> with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by <a href="symmetry%20breaking">symmetry breaking</a> in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as "fundamental constants" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the <a href="string%20landscape">string landscape</a> emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a <a href="theory%20of%20everything">theory of everything</a> having no free parameters. As <a href="Einstein">Einstein</a> said: "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a "theory of everything", <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>, proclaimed "the end of the anthropic principle" since there would be no free parameters to select. Ironically, string theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see <a href="%23String%20theory">below</a>).

The modern form of a <a href="design%20argument">design argument</a> is put forth by <a href="intelligent%20design">intelligent design</a>. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the <a href="Fine-tuned%20Universe">fine-tuning</a> observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, <a href="Elliott%20Sober">Sober</a> (2005) and Ikeda and <a href="William%20H.%20Jefferys">Jefferys</a>, argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see <a href="fine-tuned%20universe">fine-tuned universe</a>.

<a href="Paul%20Davies">Paul Davies</a>'s book "<a href="The%20Goldilocks%20Enigma">The Goldilocks Enigma</a>" (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:

Omitted here is <a href="Lee%20Smolin">Lee Smolin</a>'s model of <a href="Fecund%20universes%20theory">cosmological natural selection</a>, also known as "fecund universes", which proposes that universes have "offspring" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983) inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account <a href="cosmological">cosmological</a> and <a href="astrophysical">astrophysical</a> considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>, the evolutionary chain culminating in "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>" probably admits only one or two low probability links. 

No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is "required" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in "our" portion of "this" universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher <a href="John%20Andrew%20Leslie">John Leslie</a> states that the Carter SAP (with <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a>) predicts the following:

Hogan has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe "not" to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
The probability of observing value "X" is then proportional to "N"("X") "P"("X"). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be "over-tuned", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would "not" count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence that the Earth or the <a href="solar%20system">solar system</a> occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a> (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a <a href="necessary%20condition">necessary condition</a> for our existence as observers.

<a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on <a href="carbon-12">carbon-12</a> <a href="atom">atom</a>s, that there must be an undiscovered <a href="resonance">resonance</a> in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the <a href="triple-alpha%20process">triple-alpha process</a>. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million <a href="electronvolt">electronvolt</a>s. <a href="William%20Alfred%20Fowler">Willie Fowler</a>'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.

<a href="Don%20Page%20%28physicist%29">Don Page</a> criticized the entire theory of <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a> as follows. He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic <a href="arrow%20of%20time">arrow of time</a> in a universe with a <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. <a href="Paul%20Davies">Paul Davies</a> rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle. While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value—due to random quantum fluctuations—to account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any "ad hoc" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

<a href="String%20theory">String theory</a> predicts a large number of possible universes, called the "backgrounds" or "vacua". The set of these vacua is often called the "<a href="multiverse">multiverse</a>" or "<a href="String%20theory%20landscape">anthropic landscape</a>" or "string landscape". <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

<a href="Steven%20Weinberg">Steven Weinberg</a> believes the Anthropic Principle may be appropriated by <a href="cosmologist">cosmologist</a>s committed to <a href="nontheism">nontheism</a>, and refers to that Principle as a "turning point" in modern science because applying it to the string landscape " [...] may explain how the constants of nature that we observe can take values suitable for life without being fine-tuned by a benevolent creator". Others—most notably <a href="David%20Gross">David Gross</a> but also <a href="Lubos%20Motl">Lubos Motl</a>, <a href="Peter%20Woit">Peter Woit</a>, and <a href="Lee%20Smolin">Lee Smolin</a>—argue that this is not predictive. <a href="Max%20Tegmark">Max Tegmark</a>, <a href="Mario%20Livio">Mario Livio</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Rees">Martin Rees</a> argue that only some aspects of a physical theory need be observable and/or testable for the theory to be accepted, and that many well-accepted theories are far from completely testable at present.

<a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Schmidhuber">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a> (2000–2002) points out that <a href="Ray%20Solomonoff">Ray Solomonoff</a>'s <a href="Solomonoff%27s%20theory%20of%20inductive%20inference">theory of universal inductive inference</a> and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some <a href="prior%20distribution">prior distribution</a> on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

There are two kinds of dimensions, <a href="spatial%20dimension">spatial</a> (bidirectional) and <a href="temporal%20dimension">temporal</a> (unidirectional). Let the number of spatial dimensions be "N" and the number of temporal dimensions be "T". That "N" = 3 and "T" = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting "N" differ from 3 and "T" differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue. <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square <a href="law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">law of universal gravitation</a>. While Kant's argument is historically important, <a href="John%20D.%20Barrow">John D. Barrow</a> says that it "[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa" (Barrow 2002: 204). This is because the law of gravitation (or any other <a href="inverse-square%20law">inverse-square law</a>) follows from the concept of <a href="flux">flux</a> and the proportional relationship of flux density and the strength of field. If "N" = 3, then 3-dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional to the square of their size in any selected spatial dimension. In particular, a sphere of <a href="radius">radius</a> "r" has area of 4π"r" ². More generally, in a space of "N" dimensions, the strength of the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated by a distance of "r" would be inversely proportional to "r".

In 1920, <a href="Paul%20Ehrenfest">Paul Ehrenfest</a> showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the <a href="orbit">orbit</a> of a <a href="planet">planet</a> about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a>. Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a <a href="wave">wave</a> impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are formula_1 spatial dimensions, where "k" is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> showed that <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">Maxwell</a>'s theory of <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> works only with three dimensions of space and one of time. Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron <a href="atomic%20orbital">orbitals</a> around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> or disperse.

<a href="Max%20Tegmark">Max Tegmark</a> expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner. If "T" differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>s. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if "T" > 1, Tegmark maintains that <a href="proton">proton</a>s and <a href="electron">electron</a>s would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.)

Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back <a href="Pierre%20Teilhard%20de%20Chardin">Teilhard de Chardin</a>'s earlier interpretation of the universe as being christ centered (compare <a href="Omega%20Point">Omega Point</a>), expressing a "creatio evolutiva" instead the elder notion of "creatio continua". From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology. <a href="Karl%20W.%20Giberson">Karl W. Giberson</a> has been sort of laconic in stating that

A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book "The Anthropic Cosmological Principle" by <a href="John%20D.%20Barrow">John D. Barrow</a>, a <a href="cosmologist">cosmologist</a>, and <a href="Frank%20J.%20Tipler">Frank J. Tipler</a>, a <a href="cosmologist">cosmologist</a> and <a href="mathematical%20physicist">mathematical physicist</a>. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>, it also touches on <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, and <a href="earth%20science">earth science</a>. An entire chapter argues that "<a href="Homo%20sapiens">Homo sapiens</a>" is, with high probability, the only <a href="extraterrestrial%20intelligence">intelligent species</a> in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the <a href="history%20of%20ideas">history of ideas</a> the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of <a href="teleology">teleology</a> and <a href="intelligent%20design">intelligent design</a>. They discuss the writings of <a href="Fichte">Fichte</a>, <a href="Hegel">Hegel</a>, <a href="Bergson">Bergson</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20North%20Whitehead">Alfred North Whitehead</a>, and the <a href="Omega%20Point">Omega Point</a> cosmology of <a href="Teilhard%20de%20Chardin">Teilhard de Chardin</a>. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish <a href="teleology">teleological</a> reasoning from <a href="eutaxiology">"eutaxiological"</a> reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the <a href="final%20anthropic%20principle">final anthropic principle</a> (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and "closely connected with moral values". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the <a href="universe">universe</a>, constraints developed further in Tipler's "The Physics of Immortality". One such constraint is that the universe must end in a <a href="big%20crunch">big crunch</a>, which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, based on observations of very distant <a href="supernova">supernova</a>s.

In his review of Barrow and Tipler, <a href="Martin%20Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

Carter has frequently regretted his own choice of the word "anthropic", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general. Others have criticised the word "principle" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of <a href="selection%20effects">selection effects</a>.

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy <a href="deus%20ex%20machina">deus ex machina</a> which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: "[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts."

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as <a href="truism">truism</a>s or trivial <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautologies</a>—that is, statements true solely by virtue of their <a href="logical%20form">logical form</a> (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying "if things were different, they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a <a href="scientific%20method">scientific statement</a> but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a>, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's "anthropic cosmological principle", which are <a href="Teleology">teleological</a> notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a "necessary prerequisite" for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, <a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a>, <a href="Michael%20Shermer">Michael Shermer</a>, and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been <a href="fine-tuned%20universe">fine-tuned</a> through <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an <a href="argument%20by%20lack%20of%20imagination">argument by lack of imagination</a>, for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called "<a href="carbon%20chauvinism">carbon chauvinism</a>", see also <a href="alternative%20biochemistry">alternative biochemistry</a>). The range of <a href="dimensionless%20physical%20constant">fundamental physical constant</a>s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a <a href="fine%20tuned%20universe">fine tuned universe</a> have argued. For instance, Harnik et al. propose a <a href="weakless%20universe">weakless universe</a> in which the <a href="weak%20nuclear%20force">weak nuclear force</a> is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other <a href="fundamental%20interaction">fundamental interaction</a>s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind—<a href="star">star</a>s, <a href="planet">planet</a>s, <a href="galaxies">galaxies</a>, etc.

<a href="Lee%20Smolin">Lee Smolin</a> has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his <a href="Lee%20Smolin%23Cosmological%20natural%20selection">fecund universes</a> theory, which assumes universes have "offspring" through the creation of <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.

Some versions of the anthropic principle are only interesting if the range of physical constants that allow certain kinds of life are unlikely in a landscape of possible universes. But Lee Smolin assumes that conditions for carbon based life are similar to conditions for black hole creation, which would change the <a href="a%20priori%20distribution">a priori distribution</a> of universes such that universes containing life would be likely. In Smolin vs. Susskind: The Anthropic Principle the string theorist <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> disagrees about some assumptions in Lee Smolin's theory, while Smolin defends his theory.

The philosophers of cosmology <a href="John%20Earman">John Earman</a>, <a href="Ernan%20McMullin">Ernan McMullin</a>, and <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20Moster%C3%ADn">Jesús Mosterín</a> contend that "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation". A further criticism by Mosterín concerns the flawed "anthropic" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

Australian Army

The Australian Army is Australia's military land force. It is part of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> (ADF) along with the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. While the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a> (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Army</a> (CA). The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> has Australian territory come under direct attack.

Formed in March 1901, with the amalgamation of the six separate <a href="Colonial%20forces%20of%20Australia">colonial military forces</a>, the history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:

During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902), <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> (1914–18), the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> (1939–45), <a href="Korea%20War">Korea War</a> (1950–53), <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> (1950–60), <a href="Indonesia-Malaysia%20Confrontation">Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation</a> (1962–66), <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> (1962–73), and more recently in <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a> (2001 – present) and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> (2003–09). Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non-United Nations sponsored <a href="Multinational%20Force%20and%20Observers">Multinational Force and Observers</a> in the Sinai is a notable exception. Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in <a href="International%20Force%20for%20East%20Timor">East Timor</a>, while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on <a href="Bougainville%20Province">Bougainville</a>, in the <a href="Multinational%20Force%20and%20Observers">Sinai</a>, and in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. Humanitarian relief after <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> in <a href="Aceh">Aceh</a> Province, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="Operation%20Sumatra%20Assist">Operation Sumatra Assist</a>, ended on 24 March 2005.

The <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a> comprises a deployable headquarters, while <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a> under the command of <a href="Forces%20Command%20%28Australia%29">Forces Command</a> is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. 2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions. The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.

<a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a> carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.

<a href="Forces%20Command%20%28Australia%29">Forces Command</a> controls for administrative purposes all non-<a href="special%20forces">special-forces</a> assets of the Australian Army. It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.

Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments:
<a href="Special%20Operations%20Command%20%28Australia%29">Special Operations Command</a> comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF. It includes all of Army's <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> assets.

Under a restructuring program known as <a href="Plan%20Beersheba">Plan Beersheba</a> announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force. The force will be known as the Amphibious Ready Element and will be embarked on the Navy's new <a href="Canberra-class%20landing%20helicopter%20dock">"Canberra"-class</a> amphibious assault ships.

Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as "the Colours". Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect. Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners. Units awarded <a href="battle%20honours">battle honours</a> have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is "Ubique" which means "Everywhere" – although they can receive Honour Titles.

The Army is the guardian of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Australia">National Flag</a> and as such, unlike the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General <a href="Sir%20William%20Deane">Sir William Deane</a>, presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> on 10 March 2001. The Banner was presented to the <a href="Regimental%20Sergeant%20Major%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A)</a>, Warrant Officer Peter Rosemond.

The Army Banner bears the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Australia">Australian Coat of Arms</a> on the obverse, with the dates "1901–2001" in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the <a href="Rising%20Sun%20%28badge%29">"rising sun" badge</a> of the Australian Army, flanked by seven <a href="Battle%20honours">campaign honours</a> on small gold-edged scrolls: <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">South Africa</a>, <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Korean%20War">Korea</a>, <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya-Borneo</a>, <a href="Vietnam%20War">South Vietnam</a>, and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.

In the 2014–15 financial year the Army had an average strength of 43,667 personnel: 29,366 permanent (regular) and 14,301 active reservists (part-time). In addition, there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve. The regular Army is targeted to expand to 30,464 (regular) and 15,250 (part-time) personnel by 2015–16. Personnel numbers have trended upwards since a peak in 2010–11 with an actual strength of 29,366 full-time personnel. Army Reserve numbers are 14,301, which does not include Standby Reserves. This gives the Army a combined strength of 43,667 active personnel for the year 2014–15.

The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, and carry mostly the same actual <a href="Australian%20Army%20officer%20rank%20insignia">insignia</a>. For <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title "Australia". The <a href="Non-Commissioned%20Officer">Non-Commissioned Officer</a> <a href="Australian%20Army%20enlisted%20rank%20insignia">insignia</a> are the same up until <a href="Warrant%20Officer">Warrant Officer</a>, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows:

The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Victoria Barracks</a> in Sydney. The Australian Army's three regular brigades are based at <a href="Robertson%20Barracks">Robertson Barracks</a> near <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, <a href="Lavarack%20Barracks">Lavarack Barracks</a> in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a> and <a href="Gallipoli%20Barracks">Gallipoli Barracks</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. The Deployable Joint Force Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks.

Other important Army bases include the <a href="Oakey%20Army%20Aviation%20Centre">Army Aviation Centre</a> near <a href="Oakey%2C%20Queensland">Oakey, Queensland</a>, <a href="Holsworthy%20Barracks">Holsworthy Barracks</a> near Sydney, <a href="Lone%20Pine%20Barracks">Lone Pine Barracks</a> in <a href="Singleton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Singleton, New South Wales</a> and <a href="Woodside%20Barracks">Woodside Barracks</a> near <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, South Australia. The <a href="Australian%20Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment">SASR</a> is based at <a href="Campbell%20Barracks%20%28Australia%29">Campbell Barracks</a> <a href="Swanbourne%2C%20Western%20Australia">Swanbourne</a>, a suburb of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Western Australia.

<a href="Puckapunyal">Puckapunyal</a> north of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> houses the Australian Army's Combined Arms Training Centre, Land Warfare Development Centre, and three of the five principal Combat Arms schools. Further barracks include <a href="Steele%20Barracks%20%28Moorebank%29">Steele Barracks</a> in Sydney, <a href="Keswick%20Barracks">Keswick Barracks</a> in Adelaide, and <a href="Irwin%20Barracks">Irwin Barracks</a> at <a href="Karrakatta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Karrakatta</a> in Perth. Dozens of <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Australian Army Reserve</a> depots are located across Australia.

Since 1947, the Australian Army has published its own journal titled the "Australian Army Journal". Covering a broad range of topics including essays, book reviews and editorials, with submissions from serving members as well as professional authors, the journal's stated goal is to provide "...the primary forum for Army's professional discourse... [and to facilitate]... debate within the Australian Army ...[and raise] ...the quality and intellectual rigor of that debate by adhering to a strict and demanding standard of quality". In 1976, the journal was placed on hiatus; however, publishing began again in 1999 and since then the journal has been published largely on a quarterly basis, with only minimal interruptions.

American Registry for Internet Numbers

The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the <a href="Regional%20Internet%20Registry">Regional Internet Registry</a> (RIR) for <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and many <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> islands. ARIN manages the distribution of Internet number resources, including <a href="IPv4">IPv4</a> and <a href="IPv6">IPv6</a> address space and <a href="Autonomous%20system%20%28Internet%29">AS numbers</a>. ARIN opened its doors for business on December 22, 1997 after incorporating on April 18, 1997. ARIN is a nonprofit corporation with headquarters in <a href="Chantilly%2C%20Virginia">Chantilly, Virginia, USA</a>.

ARIN is one of five <a href="Regional%20Internet%20registry">Regional Internet Registries</a> (RIRs) in the world. Like the other RIRs, ARIN:


ARIN provides services related to the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources. The nature of these services is described in ARIN's mission statement:

These services are grouped in three areas: Registration, Organization, and Policy Development.

Registration services pertain to the technical coordination and inventory management of Internet number resources. Services include:


For information on requesting Internet number resources from ARIN, see https://www.arin.net/resources/index.html. This section includes the request templates, specific distribution policies, and guidelines for requesting and managing Internet number resources.

Organization services pertain to interaction between stakeholders, ARIN members, and ARIN. Services include:


Policy development services facilitate the development of policy for the technical coordination and management of Internet number resources.

All ARIN policies are set by the community. Everyone is encouraged to participate in the policy development process at public policy meetings and on the Public Policy Mailing List. The ARIN Board of Trustees ratifies policies only after:


The community develops policies by following a formal Policy Development Process as outlined at https://www.arin.net/policy/pdp.html. The Number Resource Policy Manual, ARIN’s complete set of current policies, is available at https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html.

Membership is not required to participate in ARIN’s policy development process or to apply for Internet number resources.

Services include:


ARIN consists of the Internet community within its region, its members, a 7-member Board of Trustees, a 15-member Advisory Council, and a professional staff of about 50. The Board of Trustees and Advisory Council are elected by ARIN members for three-year terms.

The ARIN membership elects the Board of Trustees (BoT), which has ultimate responsibility for the business affairs and financial health of ARIN, and manages ARIN's operations in a manner consistent with the guidance received from the Advisory Council and the goals set by the registry's members. The BoT is responsible for determining the disposition of all revenues received to ensure all services are provided in an equitable manner. The BoT ratifies proposals generated from the membership and submitted through the Advisory Council. Executive decisions are carried out following approval by the BoT. The BoT consists of 7 members consisting of a President and CEO, a Chairman, a Treasurer, and others.

In addition to the BoT, ARIN has an advisory council that advises ARIN and the BoT on IP address allocation policy and related matters. Adhering to the procedures in the Internet Resource Policy Evaluation Process, the advisory council forwards consensus-based policy proposals to the BoT for ratification. The advisory council consists of 15 elected members consisting of a Chair, Vice Chair, and others.

The organization was formed in December 1997 to "provide <a href="Internet%20Protocol">IP</a> registration services as an independent, nonprofit corporation." Until this time, IP address registration (outside of <a href="RIPE">RIPE</a> and <a href="APNIC">APNIC</a> regions) was done in accordance with policies set by the <a href="IETF">IETF</a> by <a href="Network%20Solutions">Network Solutions</a> corporation as part of the <a href="InterNIC">InterNIC</a> project. The National Science Foundation approved the plan for the creation of the not-for-profit organization to ""give the users of IP numbers (mostly Internet service providers, corporations and other large institutions) a voice in the policies by which they are managed and allocated within the North American region."". As part of the transition, <a href="Network%20Solutions">Network Solutions</a> corporation transitioned these tasks as well as initial staff and computer infrastructure to ARIN.

The initial Board of Trustees consisted of <a href="Scott%20Bradner">Scott Bradner</a>, <a href="John%20Curran%20%28businessman%29">John Curran</a>, Kim Hubbard, Don Telage, Randy Bush, Raymundo Vega Aguilar, and <a href="Jon%20Postel">Jon Postel</a> (IANA) as an ex-officio member.

The first president of ARIN was Kim Hubbard, from 1997 until 2000. Kim was succeeded by Raymond "Ray" Plzak until the end of 2008. Trustee John Curran was acting President until July 1 of 2009 when he assumed the CEO role permanently.

Until late 2002 it served <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and all of the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. <a href="LACNIC">LACNIC</a> now handles parts of the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, and South America. Also, <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> was part of its region until April 2005, when <a href="AfriNIC">AfriNIC</a> was officially recognized by <a href="ICANN">ICANN</a> as the fifth <a href="Regional%20Internet%20Registry">Regional Internet Registry</a>.

On 24 September 2015 ARIN has declared exhaustion of the ARIN IPv4 addresses pool.

Akihabara

Akihabara gained the nickname shortly after World War II for being a major shopping center for household electronic goods and the post-war black market. Nowadays, Akihabara is considered by many to be an <a href="otaku">otaku</a> cultural center and a shopping district for video games, <a href="anime">anime</a>, <a href="manga">manga</a>, and computer goods. Icons from popular anime and manga are displayed prominently on the shops in the area, and numerous <a href="maid%20caf%C3%A9">maid café</a>s are found throughout the district.

The main area of Akihabara is located on a street just west of <a href="Akihabara%20Station">Akihabara Station</a>, where most of the major shops are situated. Most of the electronics shops are just west of the station, and the anime and manga shops and the <a href="cosplay%20restaurant">cosplay café</a>s are north of them.

As mentioned above, the area called Akihabara now ranges over some districts in Chiyoda ward: , , and . The administrative district called Akihabara exists in <a href="Tait%C5%8D">Taitō</a> ward and borders on Sotokanda at the middle of Akihabara and <a href="Okachimachi%20Station">Okachimachi</a> stations, but its half is occupied by <a href="Japan%20Railway">JR</a> tracks.

The area that is now Akihabara was once near a city gate of <a href="Edo">Edo</a> and served as a passage between the city and northwestern Japan. This made the region a home to many craftsmen and tradesmen, as well as some low class <a href="samurai">samurai</a>. One of Tokyo's frequent fires destroyed the area in 1869, and the people decided to replace the buildings of the area with a shrine called Chinkasha (now known as ), meaning fire extinguisher shrine, in an attempt to prevent the spread of future fires. The locals nicknamed the shrine Akiba after the deity that could control fire, and the area around it became known as Akibagahara and later Akihabara. After Akihabara Station was built in 1888, the shrine was moved to the <a href="Tait%C5%8D">Taitō ward</a> where it still resides today.
Since its opening in 1890, <a href="Akihabara%20Station">Akihabara Station</a> became a major freight transit point, which allowed a vegetable and fruit market to spring up in the district. Then, in the 1920s, the station saw a large volume of passengers after opening for public transport, and after World War II, the black market thrived in the absence of a strong government. This disconnection of Akihabara from government authority has allowed the district to grow as a market city and given rise to an excellent atmosphere for entrepreneurship. In the 1930s, this climate turned Akihabara into a future-oriented market region specializing in household <a href="electronics">electronics</a>, such as washing machines, refrigerators, televisions, and stereos, earning Akihabara the nickname "Electric Town".

As household electronics began to lose their futuristic appeal in about the 1980s, the shops of Akihabara shifted their focus to home computers at a time when they were only used by specialists and hobbyists. This new specialization brought in a new type of consumer, computer nerds or "otaku". The market in Akihabara naturally latched onto their new customer base that was focused on <a href="anime">anime</a>, <a href="manga">manga</a>, and video games. The connection between Akihabara and otaku has survived and grown to the point that the region is now known worldwide as a center for otaku culture, and some otaku even consider Akihabara to be a sacred place.

On Sunday 8 June 2008 at 12:33 <a href="Japan%20Standard%20Time">JST</a>, a man drove into a crowd with a truck, then stabbed at least 17 people using a dagger. Seven died and ten were injured. <a href="Tokyo%20Metropolitan%20Police%20Department">Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department</a> arrested , 25, on suspicion of <a href="attempted%20murder">attempted murder</a>, and arrested him again weeks later on suspicion of murder. Kato was eventually sentenced to death by the Tokyo District Court in 2011, and the sentence was upheld on appeal in 2012.

The influence of "<a href="otaku">otaku</a>" culture has shaped Akihabara's businesses and buildings to reflect the interests of "otaku" and gained the district worldwide fame for its distinctive imagery. Akihabara tries to create an atmosphere as close as possible to the game and anime worlds of customers' interest. The streets of Akihabara are covered with anime and manga icons, and cosplayers line the sidewalks handing out advertisements, especially for <a href="maid%20caf%C3%A9">maid café</a>s. The idol group <a href="AKB48">AKB48</a>, one of Japan's highest selling contemporary musical acts, runs its own theater in Akihabara, from which the group's name is derived.

Release events, special events, and <a href="Fan%20convention">conventions</a> in Akihabara give anime and manga fans frequent opportunities to meet the creators of the works they follow so closely and strengthen the connection between the region and "otaku" culture. The design of many of the buildings serves to create the sort of atmosphere that draws in "otaku". Architects design the stores of Akihabara to be more opaque and closed to reflect the general desire of many "otaku" to live in their anime worlds rather than display their interests to the world at large.

Akihabara's role as a free market has also allowed a large amount of amateur work to find a passionate audience in the otaku who frequent the area. "<a href="Doujinshi">Doujinshi</a>," amateur manga (or fanmade manga based on an anime/manga/game) has been growing in Akihabara since the 1970s when publishers began to drop manga that were not ready for large markets.

Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a <a href="directory%20service">directory service</a> that <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> developed for <a href="Windows%20domain">Windows domain</a> networks. It is included in most <a href="Windows%20Server">Windows Server</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s as a set of <a href="Process%20%28computing%29">processes</a> and <a href="Windows%20service">services</a>. Initially, Active Directory was only in charge of centralized domain management. Starting with <a href="Windows%20Server%202008">Windows Server 2008</a>, however, Active Directory became an umbrella title for a broad range of directory-based identity-related services.

A server running Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is called a <a href="domain%20controller">domain controller</a>. It <a href="authentication">authenticates</a> and <a href="authorization">authorizes</a> all users and computers in a Windows domain type network—assigning and enforcing security policies for all computers and installing or updating software. For example, when a user <a href="login">logs into</a> a computer that is part of a Windows domain, Active Directory checks the submitted password and determines whether the user is a <a href="system%20administrator">system administrator</a> or normal user. Also, it allows management and storage of information, provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, and establishes a framework to deploy other related services: Certificate Services, Federated Services, Lightweight Directory Services and Rights Management Services.

Active Directory uses <a href="Lightweight%20Directory%20Access%20Protocol">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</a> (LDAP) versions 2 and 3, Microsoft's version of <a href="Kerberos%20%28protocol%29">Kerberos</a>, and <a href="Domain%20Name%20System">DNS</a>.
Active Directory, like many information-technology efforts, originated out of a <a href="Democratization%23Design">democratization of design</a> using <a href="Request%20for%20Comments">Request for Comments</a> or RFCs. The <a href="Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF), which oversees the RFC process, has accepted numerous RFCs initiated by widespread participants. Active Directory incorporates decades of communication technologies into the overarching Active Directory concept then makes improvements upon them. For example, LDAP underpins Active Directory. Also <a href="X.500">X.500</a> directories and the <a href="Organizational%20Unit">Organizational Unit</a> preceded the Active Directory concept that makes use of those methods. The LDAP concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to LDAP include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995), RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533.

Microsoft previewed Active Directory in 1999, released it first with <a href="Windows%202000">Windows 2000</a> Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in <a href="Windows%20Server%202003">Windows Server 2003</a>. Additional improvements came with subsequent versions of <a href="Windows%20Server">Windows Server</a>. In <a href="Windows%20Server%202008">Windows Server 2008</a>, additional services were added to Active Directory, such as <a href="Active%20Directory%20Federation%20Services">Active Directory Federation Services</a>. The part of the directory in charge of management of domains, which was previously a core part of the operating system, was renamed Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS) and became a server role like others. "Active Directory" became the umbrella title of a broader range of directory-based services. According to Bryon Hynes, everything related to identity was brought under Active Directory's banner.

Active Directory Services consist of multiple directory services. The best known is Active Directory Domain Services, commonly <a href="abbreviation">abbreviated</a> as AD DS or simply AD.

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is the cornerstone of every <a href="Windows%20domain">Windows domain</a> network. It stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, <a href="authentication">verifies their credentials</a> and <a href="authorization">defines their access rights</a>. The server (or the cluster of servers) running this service is called a <a href="domain%20controller">domain controller</a>. A domain controller is contacted when a user logs into a device, accesses another device across the network, or runs a line-of-business <a href="Metro-style%20app">Metro-style app</a> <a href="sideloading">sideloaded</a> into a device.

Other Active Directory services (excluding <a href="%23ADAM">LDS</a>, as described below) as well as most of Microsoft server technologies rely on or use Domain Services; examples include <a href="Group%20Policy">Group Policy</a>, <a href="Encrypting%20File%20System">Encrypting File System</a>, <a href="BitLocker">BitLocker</a>, <a href="Domain%20Name%20Services">Domain Name Services</a>, <a href="Remote%20Desktop%20Services">Remote Desktop Services</a>, <a href="Exchange%20Server">Exchange Server</a> and <a href="SharePoint%20Server">SharePoint Server</a>.

Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services ("AD LDS"), formerly known as "Active Directory Application Mode" (ADAM), is a light-weight implementation of AD DS. AD LDS runs as a <a href="Windows%20service">service</a> on <a href="Windows%20Server">Windows Server</a>. AD LDS shares the code base with AD DS and provides the same functionality, including an identical <a href="API">API</a>, but does not require the creation of domains or domain controllers. It provides a "Data Store" for storage of directory data and a "<a href="Directory%20%28database%29">Directory Service</a>" with an LDAP "Directory Service Interface". Unlike AD DS, however, multiple AD LDS instances can run on the same server.

Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) establishes an on-premises <a href="public%20key%20infrastructure">public key infrastructure</a>. It can create, validate and revoke <a href="public%20key%20certificate">public key certificate</a>s for internal uses of an organization. These certificates can be used to encrypt files (when used with <a href="Encrypting%20File%20System">Encrypting File System</a>), emails (per <a href="S/MIME">S/MIME</a> standard), network traffic (when used by <a href="virtual%20private%20network">virtual private network</a>s, <a href="Transport%20Layer%20Security">Transport Layer Security</a> protocol or <a href="IPSec">IPSec</a> protocol).

AD CS predates Windows Server 2008, but its name was simply Certificate Services.

AD CS requires an AD DS infrastructure.

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a <a href="single%20sign-on">single sign-on</a> service. With an AD FS infrastructure in place, users may use several web-based services (e.g. <a href="internet%20forum">internet forum</a>, <a href="blog">blog</a>, <a href="online%20shopping">online shopping</a>, <a href="webmail">webmail</a>) or network resources using only one set of credentials stored at a central location, as opposed to having to be granted a dedicated set of credentials for each service. AD FS's purpose is an extension of that of AD DS: The latter enables users to authenticate with and use the devices that are part of the same network, using one set of credentials. The former enables them to use the same set of credentials in a different network.

As the name suggests, AD FS works based on the concept of <a href="federated%20identity">federated identity</a>.

AD FS requires an AD DS infrastructure, although its federation partner may not.

Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS, known as Rights Management Services or RMS before <a href="Windows%20Server%202008">Windows Server 2008</a>) is a server software for <a href="information%20rights%20management">information rights management</a> shipped with <a href="Windows%20Server">Windows Server</a>. It uses encryption and a form of selective functionality denial for limiting access to documents such as corporate <a href="e-mail">e-mail</a>s, <a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a> documents, and <a href="web%20page">web page</a>s, and the operations authorized users can perform on them.

As a directory service, an Active Directory instance consists of a database and corresponding <a href="executable%20code">executable code</a> responsible for servicing requests and maintaining the database. The executable part, known as Directory System Agent, is a collection of <a href="Windows%20service">Windows service</a>s and <a href="process%20%28computing%29">processes</a> that run on Windows 2000 and later. Objects in Active Directory databases can be accessed via LDAP, ADSI (a <a href="component%20object%20model">component object model</a> interface), <a href="messaging%20API">messaging API</a> and <a href="Security%20Accounts%20Manager">Security Accounts Manager</a> services.

Active Directory structures are arrangements of information about <a href="Object%20%28computing%29">objects</a>. The objects fall into two broad categories: resources (e.g., printers) and <a href="security%20principal">security principal</a>s (user or computer accounts and groups). Security principals are assigned unique <a href="security%20identifier">security identifier</a>s (SIDs).

Each object represents a single entity—whether a user, a computer, a printer, or a group—and its attributes. Certain objects can contain other objects. An object is uniquely identified by its name and has a set of attributes—the characteristics and information that the object represents— defined by a <a href="database%20schema">schema</a>, which also determines the kinds of objects that can be stored in Active Directory.

The <a href="schema%20object">schema object</a> lets administrators extend or modify the schema when necessary. However, because each schema object is integral to the definition of Active Directory objects, deactivating or changing these objects can fundamentally change or disrupt a deployment. Schema changes automatically propagate throughout the system. Once created, an object can only be deactivated—not deleted. Changing the schema usually requires planning.

The Active Directory framework that holds the objects can be viewed at a number of levels. The forest, tree, and domain are the logical divisions in an Active Directory network.

Within a deployment, objects are grouped into domains. The objects for a single domain are stored in a single database (which can be replicated). Domains are identified by their <a href="Domain%20Name%20System">DNS</a> name structure, the <a href="namespace">namespace</a>.

A domain is defined as a logical group of network objects (computers, users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database.

A tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees in a contiguous namespace, linked in a transitive trust hierarchy.

At the top of the structure is the "forest." A forest is a collection of trees that share a common global catalog, directory schema, logical structure, and directory configuration. The forest represents the security boundary within which users, computers, groups, and other objects are accessible.

The objects held within a domain can be grouped into <a href="Organizational%20Unit">Organizational Unit</a>s (OUs). OUs can provide hierarchy to a domain, ease its administration, and can resemble the organization's structure in managerial or geographical terms. OUs can contain other OUs—domains are containers in this sense. Microsoft recommends using OUs rather than domains for structure and to simplify the implementation of policies and administration. The OU is the recommended level at which to apply <a href="group%20policies">group policies</a>, which are Active Directory objects formally named Group Policy Objects (GPOs), although policies can also be applied to domains or sites (see below). The OU is the level at which administrative powers are commonly delegated, but delegation can be performed on individual objects or attributes as well.

Organizational units do not each have a separate namespace; e.g. user accounts with an identical username (sAMAccountName) in separate OUs within a domain are not allowed, such as "fred.staff-ou.domain" and "fred.student-ou.domain", where "staff-ou" and "student-ou" are the OUs. This is because sAMAccountName, a user object attribute, must be unique within the domain. However, two users in different OUs can have the same Common Name (CN), the name under which they are stored in the directory itself.

In general the reason for this lack of allowance for duplicate names through hierarchical directory placement, is that Microsoft primarily relies on the principles of <a href="NetBIOS">NetBIOS</a>, which is a flat-file method of network object management that for Microsoft software, goes all the way back to <a href="Windows%20NT%203.1">Windows NT 3.1</a> and <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> <a href="LAN%20Manager">LAN Manager</a>. Allowing for duplication of object names in the directory, or completely removing the use of NetBIOS names, would prevent backward compatibility with legacy software and equipment. However, disallowing duplicate object names in this way is a violation of the LDAP RFCs on which Active Directory is supposedly based.

As the number of users in a domain increases, conventions such as "first initial, middle initial, last name" (<a href="Name%20order">Western order</a>) or the reverse (Eastern order) fail for common <a href="family%20names">family names</a> like "Li (李)", "Smith" or "Garcia". Workarounds include adding a digit to the end of the username. Alternatives include creating a separate ID system of unique employee/student id numbers to use as account names in place of actual user's names, and allowing users to nominate their preferred word sequence within an <a href="acceptable%20use%20policy">acceptable use policy</a>.

Because duplicate usernames cannot exist within a domain, account name generation poses a significant challenge for large organizations that cannot be easily subdivided into separate domains, such as students in a public school system or university who must be able to use any computer across the network.

In Microsoft's Active Directory, OUs do not confer access permissions, and objects placed within OUs are not automatically assigned access privileges based on their containing OU. This is a design limitation specific to Active Directory. Other competing directories such as Novell <a href="Novell%20eDirectory">NDS</a> are able to assign access privileges through object placement within an OU.

Active Directory requires a separate step for an administrator to assign an object in an OU as a member of a group also within that OU. Relying on OU location alone to determine access permissions is unreliable, because the object may not have been assigned to the group object for that OU.

A common workaround for an Active Directory administrator is to write a custom <a href="PowerShell">PowerShell</a> or <a href="Visual%20Basic">Visual Basic</a> script to automatically create and maintain a "user group" for each OU in their directory. The scripts are run periodically to update the group to match the OU's account membership, but are unable to instantly update the security groups anytime the directory changes, as occurs in competing directories where security is directly implemented into the directory itself. Such groups are known as "Shadow Groups". Once created, these shadow groups are selectable in place of the OU in the administrative tools.

Microsoft refers to shadow groups in the Server 2008 Reference documentation, but does not explain how to create them. There are no built-in server methods or console snap-ins for managing shadow groups.

The division of an organization's information infrastructure into a hierarchy of one or more domains and top-level OUs is a key decision. Common models are by business unit, by geographical location, by IT Service, or by object type and hybrids of these. OUs should be structured primarily to facilitate administrative delegation, and secondarily, to facilitate group policy application. Although OUs form an administrative boundary, the only true security boundary is the forest itself and an administrator of any domain in the forest must be trusted across all domains in the forest.

The Active Directory database is organized in "partitions", each holding specific object types and following a specific replication pattern. Microsoft often refers to these partitions as 'naming contexts'. The 'Schema' partition contains the definition of object classes and attributes within the Forest. The 'Configuration' partition contains information on the physical structure and configuration of the forest (such as the site topology). Both replicate to all domains in the Forest. The 'Domain' partition holds all objects created in that domain and replicates only within its domain.

"Sites" are physical (rather than logical) groupings defined by one or more <a href="Internet%20Protocol">IP</a> subnets. AD also holds the definitions of connections, distinguishing low-speed (e.g., <a href="Wide%20area%20network">WAN</a>, <a href="Virtual%20private%20network">VPN</a>) from high-speed (e.g., <a href="local%20area%20network">LAN</a>) links. Site definitions are independent of the domain and OU structure and are common across the forest. Sites are used to control network traffic generated by replication and also to refer clients to the nearest <a href="domain%20controller">domain controller</a>s (DCs). <a href="Microsoft%20Exchange%20Server">Microsoft Exchange Server 2007</a> uses the site topology for mail routing. Policies can also be defined at the site level.

Physically, the Active Directory information is held on one or more peer <a href="domain%20controller">domain controller</a>s, replacing the <a href="Windows%20NT">NT</a> <a href="Primary%20Domain%20Controller">PDC</a>/<a href="Backup%20Domain%20Controller">BDC</a> model. Each DC has a copy of the Active Directory. Servers joined to Active Directory that are not domain controllers are called Member Servers. A subset of objects in the domain partition replicate to domain controllers that are configured as global catalogs. Global catalog (GC) servers provide a global listing of all objects in the Forest.
Global Catalog servers replicate to themselves all objects from all domains and hence, provide a global listing of objects in the forest. However, to minimize replication traffic and keep the GC's database small, only selected attributes of each object are replicated. This is called the partial attribute set (PAS). The PAS can be modified by modifying the schema and marking attributes for replication to the GC. Earlier versions of Windows used <a href="NetBIOS">NetBIOS</a> to communicate. Active Directory is fully integrated with DNS and requires <a href="TCPIP">TCP/IP</a>—DNS. To be fully functional, the DNS server must support <a href="SRV%20record">SRV resource records</a>, also known as service records.

Active Directory synchronizes changes using "<a href="multi-master%20replication">multi-master replication</a>". Replication by default is 'pull' rather than 'push', meaning that replicas pull changes from the server where the change was effected. The "Knowledge Consistency Checker" (KCC) creates a replication topology of "site links" using the defined "sites" to manage traffic. Intrasite replication is frequent and automatic as a result of change notification, which triggers peers to begin a pull replication cycle. Intersite replication intervals are typically less frequent and do not use change notification by default, although this is configurable and can be made identical to intrasite replication.

Each link can have a 'cost' (e.g., <a href="Digital%20Signal%203">DS3</a>, <a href="Digital%20Signal%201">T1</a>, <a href="ISDN">ISDN</a> etc.) and the KCC alters the site link topology accordingly. Replication may occur transitively through several site links on same-protocol "site link bridges", if the cost is low, although KCC automatically costs a direct site-to-site link lower than transitive connections. Site-to-site replication can be configured to occur between a "bridgehead server" in each site, which then replicates the changes to other DCs within the site. Replication for Active Directory zones is automatically configured when DNS is activated in the domain based by site.

Replication of Active Directory uses <a href="Remote%20Procedure%20Call">Remote Procedure Call</a>s (RPC) over IP (RPC/IP). Between Sites <a href="SMTP">SMTP</a> can be used for replication, but only for changes in the Schema, Configuration, or Partial Attribute Set (Global Catalog) GCs. SMTP cannot be used for replicating the default Domain partition.

In general, a network utilizing Active Directory has more than one licensed Windows server computer. Backup and restore of Active Directory is possible for a network with a single domain controller, but Microsoft recommends more than one domain controller to provide automatic <a href="failover">failover</a> protection of the directory. Domain controllers are also ideally single-purpose for directory operations only, and should not run any other software or role.

Certain Microsoft products such as SQL Server and Exchange can interfere with the operation of a domain controller, necessitating isolation of these products on additional Windows servers. Combining them can make configuration or troubleshooting of either the domain controller or the other installed software more difficult. A business intending to implement Active Directory is therefore recommended to purchase a number of Windows server licenses, to provide for at least two separate domain controllers, and optionally, additional domain controllers for performance or redundancy, a separate file server, a separate Exchange server, a separate SQL Server, and so forth to support the various server roles.

Physical hardware costs for the many separate servers can be reduced through the use of <a href="virtualization">virtualization</a>, although for proper failover protection, Microsoft recommends not running multiple virtualized domain controllers on the same physical hardware.

The Active-Directory <a href="database">database</a>, the "directory store", in Windows 2000 Server uses the <a href="Microsoft%20JET%20Blue">JET Blue</a>-based <a href="Extensible%20Storage%20Engine">Extensible Storage Engine</a> (ESE98) and is limited to 16 terabytes and 2 billion objects (but only 1 billion security principals) in each domain controller's database. Microsoft has created NTDS databases with more than 2 billion objects. (NT4's <a href="Security%20Account%20Manager">Security Account Manager</a> could support no more than 40,000 objects). Called NTDS.DIT, it has two main tables: the "data table" and the "link table". Windows Server 2003 added a third main table for <a href="security%20descriptor">security descriptor</a> single instancing.

Programs may access the features of Active Directory via the <a href="Component%20Object%20Model">COM interfaces</a> provided by "Active Directory Service Interfaces".

<a href="FSMO">Flexible Single Master Operations Roles</a> (FSMO, pronounced "fizz-mo") operations are also known as operations master roles. Although domain controllers allow simultaneous updates in multiple places, certain operations are supported only on a single server. These operations are performed using the roles listed below:

To allow users in one domain to access resources in another, Active Directory uses trusts.

Trusts inside a forest are automatically created when domains are created. The forest sets the default boundaries of trust, and implicit, transitive trust is automatic for all domains within a forest.


Windows Server 2003 introduced the "forest root trust". This trust can be used to connect Windows Server 2003 forests if they are operating at the 2003 forest functional level. Authentication across this type of trust is <a href="Kerberos%20%28protocol%29">Kerberos</a>-based (as opposed to <a href="NTLM">NTLM</a>).

Forest trusts are transitive for all the domains within the trusted forests. However, forest trusts are "not" transitive between forests.

Example: Suppose that a two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest A and Forest B, and another two-way transitive forest trust exists between the forest root domains in Forest B and Forest C. Such a configuration lets users in Forest B access resources in any domain in either Forest A or Forest C, and users in Forest A or C can access resources in any domain in Forest B. However, it does "not" let users in Forest A access resources in Forest C, or vice versa. To let users in Forest A and Forest C share resources, a two-way transitive trust must exist between both forests.

Microsoft Active Directory management tools include:

These management tools may not provide enough functionality for efficient workflow in large environments. Some third-party solutions extend the administration and management capabilities. They provide essential features for a more convenient administration processes, such as automation, reports, integration with other services, etc.

Varying levels of interoperability with Active Directory can be achieved on most <a href="Unix-like">Unix-like</a> operating systems (including <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> or Java and Unix-based programs) through standards-compliant LDAP clients, but these systems usually do not interpret many attributes associated with Windows components, such as <a href="Group%20Policy">Group Policy</a> and support for one-way trusts.

Third parties offer Active Directory integration for Unix-like platforms, including:

The schema additions shipped with <a href="Windows%20Server%202003%20R2">Windows Server 2003 R2</a> include attributes that map closely enough to RFC 2307 to be generally usable. The reference implementation of RFC 2307, nss_ldap and pam_ldap provided by PADL.com, support these attributes directly. The default schema for group membership complies with RFC 2307bis (proposed). Windows Server 2003 R2 includes a <a href="Microsoft%20Management%20Console">Microsoft Management Console</a> snap-in that creates and edits the attributes.

An alternate option is to use another directory service as non-Windows clients authenticate to this while Windows Clients authenticate to AD. Non-Windows clients include <a href="389%20Directory%20Server">389 Directory Server</a> (formerly Fedora Directory Server, FDS), ViewDS Identity Solutions - ViewDS v7.2 <a href="XML%20Enabled%20Directory">XML Enabled Directory</a> and Sun Microsystems <a href="Sun%20Java%20System%20Directory%20Server">Sun Java System Directory Server</a>. The latter two both being able to perform two-way synchronization with AD and thus provide a "deflected" integration.

Another option is to use <a href="OpenLDAP">OpenLDAP</a> with its "translucent" overlay, which can extend entries in any remote LDAP server with additional attributes stored in a local database. Clients pointed at the local database see entries containing both the remote and local attributes, while the remote database remains completely untouched.

Administration (querying, modifying, and monitoring) of Active Directory can be achieved via many scripting languages, including <a href="PowerShell">PowerShell</a>, <a href="VBScript">VBScript</a>, <a href="JavaScript">JScript/JavaScript</a>, <a href="Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="Python%20%28programming%20language%29">Python</a>, and <a href="Ruby%20%28programming%20language%29">Ruby</a>. Free and non-free AD administration tools can help to simplify and possibly automate AD management tasks.

This coalition was a prelude to the <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">Union of Krewo</a> in 1385, and the <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">Union of Lublin</a> in 1569, which resulted in the creation of a new state, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish captives, some 25,000 people, who returned to Poland. The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that Władysław abandoned his earlier plans to marry his son to <a href="Jutta%20of%20Bohemia">Jutta of Bohemia</a>. The alliance was put into effect when joint Polish–Lithuanian forces organized an attack against the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> in 1326. However, the coalition was not strong and collapsed c. 1330. Yet, there is no evidence of fighting between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive. Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339, and was buried in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>.

Aldona was remembered for her <a href="piety">piety</a> and devotion to music. She was accompanied by court musicians wherever she went. It was even suggested by <a href="Jan%20D%C5%82ugosz">Jan Długosz</a> that the <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s which were played in procession before her represented a <a href="Lithuanian%20mythology">pagan Lithuanian</a> tradition. Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona's death he married three more times. Aldona had two daughters:

Aron Nimzowitsch

Aron Nimzowitsch (, , "Aron Isayevich Nimtsovich"; born Aron Niemzowitsch; 7 November 1886 – 16 March 1935) was a <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n-born, <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> leading chess master and a very influential chess writer. He was the foremost figure amongst the "<a href="hypermodernism%20%28chess%29">hypermoderns</a>".

Born in part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the Jewish German-speaking Nimzowitsch came from a wealthy family, where he learned <a href="chess">chess</a> from his father, who was a merchant. In 1904, he travelled to Berlin to study <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, but set aside his studies soon and began a career as a professional chess player that same year. He won his first international tournament at Munich 1906. Then, he tied for first with <a href="Alexander%20Alekhine">Alexander Alekhine</a> at Saint Petersburg 1913/14 (the eighth <a href="Russian%20Chess%20Championship">All-Russian Masters' Tournament</a>).

During the 1917 <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a>, Nimzowitsch was in the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a> war zone. He escaped being drafted into one of the armies by feigning madness, insisting that a fly was on his head. He then escaped to Berlin, and gave his first name as Arnold, possibly to avoid anti-Semitic persecution.

Nimzowitsch eventually moved to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in 1922, which coincided with his rise to the world chess elite, where he lived for the rest of his life in one small rented room. In Copenhagen, he twice won the <a href="Nordic%20Chess%20Championship">Nordic Chess Championship</a>, in 1924 and 1934. He obtained Danish citizenship and lived in Denmark until his death in 1935.

The height of Nimzowitsch's career was the late 1920s and early 1930s. <a href="Chessmetrics">Chessmetrics</a> places him as the third best player in the world from 1927 to 1931, behind <a href="Alexander%20Alekhine">Alexander Alekhine</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Capablanca">José Capablanca</a>. His most notable successes were first-place finishes at <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> 1923, <a href="Marienbad">Marienbad</a> 1925, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> 1926, <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> 1926, the <a href="Carlsbad%201929%20chess%20tournament">Carlsbad 1929 chess tournament</a>, and second place behind Alekhine at the <a href="San%20Remo%201930%20chess%20tournament">San Remo 1930 chess tournament</a>. Nimzowitsch never developed a knack for match play, though; his best match success was a draw with Alekhine, but the match consisted of only two games and took place in 1914, thirteen years before Alekhine became world champion.

Nimzowitsch never beat Capablanca, but fared better against Alekhine. He even beat Alekhine with the <a href="White%20and%20Black%20in%20chess">black pieces</a>, in their short 1914 match at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>. One of Nimzowitsch's most famous games is his celebrated <a href="Immortal%20Zugzwang%20Game">immortal zugzwang game</a> against <a href="Friedrich%20S%C3%A4misch">Sämisch</a> at <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> 1923. Another game on this theme is his win over Paul Johner at <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> 1926. When in form, Nimzowitsch was very dangerous with the black pieces, scoring many fine wins over top players.

Nimzowitsch is considered one of the most important players and writers in chess history. His works influenced numerous other players, including <a href="Savielly%20Tartakower">Savielly Tartakower</a>, <a href="Milan%20Vidmar">Milan Vidmar</a>, <a href="Richard%20R%C3%A9ti">Richard Réti</a>, <a href="Akiba%20Rubinstein">Akiba Rubinstein</a>, <a href="Bent%20Larsen">Bent Larsen</a> and <a href="Tigran%20Petrosian">Tigran Petrosian</a>, and his influence is still felt today.

He wrote three books on chess strategy: "<a href="Mein%20System">Mein System</a> (My System)", 1925, "Die Praxis meines Systems (The Practice of My System)", 1929, commonly known as "Chess Praxis", and "Die Blockade" ("The Blockade"), 1925, though much in the latter book is generally held to be a rehash of material already presented in "Mein System". "Mein System" is considered to be one of the most influential chess books of all time. It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas, while his second most influential work, "Chess Praxis", elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games accompanied by his idiosyncratic, hyperbolic commentary which is often as entertaining as instructive.

Nimzowitsch's <a href="chess%20theory">chess theories</a>, when first propounded, flew in the face of widely held orthodoxies enunciated by the dominant theorist of the era, <a href="Siegbert%20Tarrasch">Siegbert Tarrasch</a>, and his disciples. Tarrasch's rigid generalizations drew on the earlier work of <a href="Wilhelm%20Steinitz">Wilhelm Steinitz</a>, and were upheld by Tarrasch's sharp tongue when dismissing the opinions of doubters. While the greatest players of the time, among them <a href="Alexander%20Alekhine">Alekhine</a>, <a href="Emanuel%20Lasker">Emanuel Lasker</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ra%C3%BAl%20Capablanca">Capablanca</a>, clearly did not allow their play to be hobbled by blind adherence to general concepts that the center had to be controlled by <a href="Pawn%20%28chess%29">pawns</a>, that development had to happen in support of this control, that rooks always belong on open files, that wing openings were unsound—core ideas of Tarrasch's chess philosophy as popularly understood—beginners were taught to think of these generalizations as unalterable principles.

Nimzowitsch supplemented many of the earlier simplistic assumptions about chess strategy by enunciating in his turn a further number of general concepts of defensive play aimed at achieving one's own goals by preventing realization of the opponent's plans. Notable in his "system" were concepts such as <a href="Glossary%20of%20chess%23Overprotection">overprotection</a> of pieces and pawns under attack, control of the center by pieces instead of pawns, blockading of opposing pieces (notably the <a href="passed%20pawns">passed pawns</a>) and <a href="prophylaxis%20%28chess%29">prophylaxis</a>. He was also a leading exponent of the <a href="fianchetto">fianchetto</a> development of <a href="bishop%20%28chess%29">bishops</a>. Perhaps most importantly, he formulated the terminology still in use for various complex chess strategies. Others had used these ideas in practice, but he was the first to present them systematically as a lexicon of themes accompanied by extensive taxonomical observations.

<a href="Grandmaster%20%28chess%29">Grandmaster</a> (GM) <a href="Raymond%20Keene">Raymond Keene</a> writes that Nimzowitsch "was one of the world's leading grandmasters for a period extending over a quarter of a century, and for some of that time he was the obvious challenger for the world championship. ... [He was also] a great and profound chess thinker second only to Steinitz, and his works – "Die Blockade", "My System" and "Chess Praxis" – established his reputation as one of the father figures of modern chess." GM <a href="Robert%20Byrne%20%28chess%20player%29">Robert Byrne</a> called him "perhaps the most brilliant theoretician and teacher in the history of the game." GM <a href="Jan%20Hein%20Donner">Jan Hein Donner</a> called Nimzowitsch "a man who was too much of an artist to be able to prove he was right and who was regarded as something of a madman in his time. He would be understood only long after his death."

Many chess openings and variations are named after Nimzowitsch, the most famous being the <a href="Nimzo-Indian%20Defence">Nimzo-Indian Defence</a> (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the less often played <a href="Nimzowitsch%20Defence">Nimzowitsch Defence</a> (1.e4 Nc6). Nimzowitsch biographer GM Raymond Keene and others have referred to 1.Nf3 followed by 2.b3 as the <a href="Larsen%27s%20Opening">Nimzowitsch–Larsen Attack</a>. Keene wrote a book about the opening with that title. These openings all exemplify Nimzowitsch's ideas about controlling the center with pieces instead of pawns. He was also vital in the development of two important systems in the <a href="French%20Defence">French Defence</a>, the (in some places called the Nimzowitsch Variation; its moves are 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4) and the (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.e5). He also pioneered two provocative variations of the <a href="Sicilian%20Defence">Sicilian Defence</a>: the , 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6, which invites 3.e5 Nd5 (similar to <a href="Alekhine%27s%20Defence">Alekhine's Defence</a>) and 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5?! (the latter regarded as dubious today). International Master <a href="John%20L.%20Watson">John L. Watson</a> has dubbed the line 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4 the "Nimzo-English", employing this designation in Chapter 11 of his recent book "Mastering the Chess Openings, Volume 3".

There are many entertaining anecdotes regarding Nimzowitsch—some less savory than others. An article by Hans Kmoch and Fred Reinfeld entitled "Unconventional Surrender" on page 55 of the February 1950 Chess Review tells of the "... example of Nimzowitsch, who ... once missed first prize in a tournament in Berlin by losing to Sämisch, and when it became clear he was going to lose the game, Nimzowitsch stood up on the table and shouted, 'Gegen diesen Idioten muss ich verlieren!' ('That I should lose to this idiot!')".

Nimzowitsch was annoyed by his opponents' smoking. A popular, but probably apocryphal, story is that once when an opponent laid an unlit cigar on the table, he complained to the tournament arbiters, "He is threatening to smoke, and as an old player you must know that the threat is stronger than the execution."

Nimzowitsch had lengthy and somewhat bitter dogmatic conflicts with Tarrasch over whose ideas constituted 'proper' chess.

Nimzowitsch's vanity and faith in his ideas of overprotection provoked <a href="Hans%20Kmoch">Hans Kmoch</a> to write a parody about him in February 1928 in the "<a href="Wiener%20Schachzeitung">Wiener Schachzeitung</a>". This consisted of a <a href="http%3A//www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame%3Fgid%3D1334664%26amp%3Bkpage%3D1">mock game</a> against the fictional player "Systemsson", supposedly played and annotated by Nimzowitsch himself. The annotations gleefully exaggerate the idea of overprotection, as well as asserting the true genius of the wondrous idea. Kmoch was in fact a great admirer of Nimzowitsch, and the subject of the parody himself was amused at the effort.

Kmoch also wrote an article about his nine years with Nimzowitsch:

Nimzowitsch's colleague <a href="Savielly%20Tartakower">Tartakower</a> observed of him, "He pretends to be crazy in order to drive us all crazy."

Although he had long suffered from heart trouble, his early death was unexpected; taken ill suddenly at the end of 1934, he lay bedridden for three months before dying of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. He is buried in <a href="Bispebjerg">Bispebjerg</a> Cemetery in Copenhagen.

Aragonese language

Aragonese (; "aragonés" in Aragonese) is a <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance language</a> spoken in several dialects by 10,000 to 30,000 people in the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> valleys of <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>, Spain, primarily in the <a href="Comarca%23Spain">comarcas</a> of <a href="Somontano%20de%20Barbastro">Somontano de Barbastro</a>, <a href="Jacetania">Jacetania</a>, <a href="Alto%20G%C3%A1llego">Alto Gállego</a>, <a href="Sobrarbe">Sobrarbe</a>, and <a href="Ribagorza/Ribagor%C3%A7a">Ribagorza/Ribagorça</a>. It is the only modern language which survived from medieval <a href="Navarro-Aragonese">Navarro-Aragonese</a> in a form distinctly different from <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>.

Informally known as "fabla" ("talk" or "speech"), Aragonese is also commonly referred to by the names of its <a href="Aragonese%20language%23Dialects">local dialects</a> such as "cheso" (from <a href="Valle%20de%20Hecho">Valle de Hecho</a>) or "patués" (from the <a href="Benasque">Benasque</a> Valley).

Aragonese, which developed in portions of the <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a> basin, can be traced back to the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>. It spread throughout the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> to areas where languages similar to <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> were previously spoken. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Kingdom of Aragon</a> (formed by the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza) expanded southward from the mountains, pushing the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> farther south in the "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>" and spreading the Aragonese language.

The union of the <a href="Catalonia">Catalan counties</a> and the Kingdom of Aragon which formed the 12th-century <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> did not merge the languages of the two territories; <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> continued to be spoken in the east and <a href="Navarro-Aragonese">Navarro-Aragonese</a> in the west, with boundaries blurred by <a href="Dialect%20continuum">dialectal continuity</a>. The Aragonese "Reconquista" in the south ended with the cession of <a href="Murcia">Murcia</a> by <a href="James%20I%20of%20Aragon">James I of Aragon</a> to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a> as dowry for an Aragonese princess.

The best-known proponent of the Aragonese language was <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20de%20Heredia">Johan Ferrandez d'Heredia</a>, the <a href="Grand%20Master%20of%20the%20Knights%20Hospitaller">Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller</a> in <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> at the end of the 14th century. He wrote an extensive catalog of works in Aragonese and translated several works from Greek into Aragonese (the first in medieval Europe).

The spread of Castilian (<a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>), the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> origin of the <a href="House%20of%20Trast%C3%A1mara">Trastámara dynasty</a>, and the similarity between Castilian and Aragonese facilitated the recession of the latter. A turning point was the 15th-century coronation of the Castilian <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand I of Aragon</a>, also known as Ferdinand of Antequeraa.

In recent times, Aragonese was mostly regarded as a group of rural dialects of Spanish. Compulsory education undermined its already weak position; for example, pupils were punished for using it. However, the 1978 <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">Spanish transition to democracy</a> heralded literary works and studies of the language.

Aragonese is the native language of the Aragonese mountain ranges of the Pyrenees, in the "<a href="comarca">comarca</a>s" of Somontano, Jacetania, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza. Cities and towns in which Aragonese is spoken are <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a>, <a href="Graus">Graus</a>, <a href="Monz%C3%B3n">Monzón</a>, <a href="Barbastro">Barbastro</a>, <a href="Bielsa">Bielsa</a>, <a href="Gista%C3%ADn">Chistén</a>, <a href="Fonz">Fonz</a>, <a href="Echo%2C%20Arag%C3%B3n%2C%20Spain">Echo</a>, <a href="Estadilla">Estadilla</a>, <a href="Benasque">Benasque</a>, <a href="Campo%2C%20Aragon">Campo</a>, <a href="Sabi%C3%B1%C3%A1nigo">Sabiñánigo</a>, <a href="Jaca">Jaca</a>, <a href="Plan">Plan</a>, <a href="Ans%C3%B3">Ansó</a>, <a href="Ayerbe">Ayerbe</a>, <a href="Broto">Broto</a>, and <a href="El%20Grado">El Grado</a>.

It is spoken as a second language by inhabitants of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a>, <a href="Ejea%20de%20los%20Caballeros">Ejea de los Caballeros</a>, or <a href="Teruel">Teruel</a>. According to recent polls, there are about 25,500 speakers (2011) including speakers living outside the native area. 

In 2009, the <a href="Languages%20Act%20of%20Aragon">Languages Act of Aragon</a> recognized the "native language, original and historic" of <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>. The language received several <a href="linguistic%20rights">linguistic rights</a>, including its use in public administration.


Aragonese has many historical traits in common with Catalan. Some are conservative features that are also shared with the <a href="Astur-Leonese%20languages">Astur-Leonese languages</a> and <a href="Galician-Portuguese">Galician-Portuguese</a>, where Spanish innovated in ways that did not spread to nearby languages.





In 2010, the <a href="Academia%20de%20l%27Aragon%C3%A9s">Academia de l'Aragonés</a> (founded in 2006) established an orthographic standard to modernize medieval <a href="orthography">orthography</a> and to make it more etymological. The new orthography is used by the .

Aragonese had two orthographic standards:

During the 16th century, Aragonese <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s wrote <a href="aljamiado">aljamiado</a> texts (Romance texts in Arabic writing), possibly because of their inability to write in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>. The language in these texts has a mixture of Aragonese and Castilian traits, and they are among the last known written examples of the Aragonese formerly spoken in central and southern Aragon.

Aragonese grammar is similar to that of other Iberian Romance languages, such as Spanish and <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>.

The definite article in Aragonese has undergone dialect-related changes, with definite articles in Old Aragonese similar to their present Spanish equivalents. The most-widespread articles in Aragonese are similar to those in Galician and Portuguese, since they lack the initial "l":

The second (auxiliary) article, after a vowel, is used with an "r" (pronounced [ɾ]).

Neighboring Romance languages have influenced Aragonese. Catalan and Occitan influenced Medieval Aragonese, and the Catalan influence continued under the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> in the <a href="Ribagor%C3%A7an%20dialect">Ribagorçan dialect</a>. Since the 15th century, Spanish has most influenced Aragonese; it was adopted throughout Aragon as the first language, limiting Aragonese to the northern region surrounding the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. <a href="French%20language">French</a> has also influenced Aragonese; Italian loanwords have entered through other languages (such as Catalan), and Portuguese words have entered through Spanish. Germanic words came with the conquest of the region by Germanic peoples during the fifth century, and <a href="English%20language">English</a> has introduced a number of new words into the language.

Words that were part of the <a href="Latin%20declension%23Second%20declension%20.28o%20stems.29">Latin second declension</a>—as well as words that joined it later on—are usually masculine:


Words that were part of the <a href="Latin%20declension%23First%20declension%20.28a%20stems.29">Latin first declension</a> are usually feminine:

Some Latin neuter plural nouns joined the <a href="Latin%20declension%23First%20declension%20.28a%20stems.29">first declension</a> as singular feminine nouns: 

Words ending in "-or" are feminine:

The names of fruit trees usually end in "-era" (a suffix derived from Latin -ARIA) and are usually feminine:

The genders of river names vary:


Unlike most other Ibero-Romance varieties, Aragonese has <a href="partitive">partitive</a> and <a href="locative%20case">locative</a> <a href="clitic">clitic</a> pronouns derived from the Latin "inde" and "ibi": "en"/"ne" and "bi"/"i"/"ie".

Such pronouns are present in most major Romance languages (<a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> "en" and "hi", <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a> "ne" and "i", French "en" and "y", and Italian "ne" and "ci"/"vi").

"En/ne" is used for:

"Bi/i/ie" is used for:

Aragonese was not written until the 12th and 13th centuries; the history "Liber Regum", "Razón feita d'amor", "Libre dels tres reys d'orient", and "Vida de Santa María Egipcíaca" date from this period, there is also an Aragonese version of the <a href="Chronicle%20of%20the%20Morea%23Aragonese%20text">Chronicle of Morea</a>, differing also in its content and written in the late 14th century called "Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea".

Since 1500, Spanish was the cultural language of Aragon; many Aragonese wrote in Spanish, and during the 17th century the Argensola brothers went to Castile to teach Spanish.
Aragonese became a popular village language. During the 17th century, popular literature in the language began to appear. In a 1650 Huesca literary contest, Aragonese poems were submitted by Matías Pradas, Isabel de Rodas and "Fileno, montañés".

The 19th and 20th centuries have seen a renaissance of Aragonese literature in several dialects. In 1844, Braulio Foz' novel "Vida de Pedro Saputo" was published in the Almudévar (southern) dialect. The 20th century featured Domingo Miral's <a href="costumbrismo">costumbrist</a> comedies and Veremundo Méndez Coarasa's poetry, both in Hecho (western) Aragonese; Cleto Torrodellas' poetry and Tonón de Baldomera's popular writings in the Graus (eastern) dialect and Arnal Cavero's costumbrist stories and Juana Coscujuela' novel "A Lueca, historia d'una moceta d'o Semontano", also in the <a href="Somontano%20de%20Barbastro">southern</a> dialect.

Advanced Mobile Phone System

Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) is an <a href="analog%20signal">analog</a> <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a> system standard developed by <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a>, and officially introduced in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> on October 13, 1983, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in 1986, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> in 1987, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in 1988, and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in 1990. It was the primary analog mobile phone system in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> (and other locales) through the 1980s and into the 2000s. As of February 18, 2008, carriers in the United States were no longer required to support AMPS and companies such as AT&T and Verizon have discontinued this service permanently. AMPS was discontinued in Australia in September 2000, in Pakistan by October 2004, and Brazil by 2010.

The first cellular network efforts began at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> and with research conducted at <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a>. 
In 1960, <a href="John%20Francis%20Mitchell">John F. Mitchell</a>,
an electrical engineer who had graduated from the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, became Motorola's chief engineer for its mobile-communication products. Mitchell oversaw the development and marketing of the first <a href="pager">pager</a> to use transistors.

Motorola had long produced <a href="Radiotelephone">mobile telephone</a>s for automobiles, but these large and heavy models consumed too much power to allow their use without the automobile's engine running. Mitchell's team, which included the gifted <a href="Martin%20Cooper%20%28inventor%29">Dr. Martin Cooper</a>, developed portable cellular telephony, and Mitchell was among the Motorola employees granted a <a href="patent">patent</a> for this work in 1973; the first call on the prototype connected, reportedly, to a wrong number.

While Motorola was developing a cellular phone, from 1968-1983 Bell Labs worked out a system called Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), which became the first cellular network standard in the United States. The first system was successfully deployed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1979. Motorola and others designed and built the cellular phones for this and other cellular systems.

<a href="Martin%20Cooper%20%28inventor%29">Martin Cooper</a>, a former general manager for the systems division at Motorola, led a team that produced the <a href="Motorola%20DynaTAC">DynaTAC8000x</a>, the first commercially available cellular phone small enough to be easily carried, and made the first phone call from it, and later introduced the so-called <a href="Motorola%20Bag%20Phone">Bag Phone</a>.

In 1992 the first <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a>, called <a href="IBM%20Simon">IBM Simon</a>, used AMPS. Frank Canova led its design at <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and it was demonstrated that year at the <a href="COMDEX">COMDEX</a> computer-industry trade-show. A refined version of the product was marketed to consumers in 1994 by <a href="BellSouth">BellSouth</a> under the name <a href="IBM%20Simon">Simon Personal Communicator</a>. The Simon was the first device that can be properly referred to as a "smartphone", even though that term was not yet coined.

AMPS is a first-generation <a href="Cellular%20network">cellular</a> technology that uses separate frequencies, or "channels", for each conversation (see <a href="frequency-division%20multiple%20access">frequency-division multiple access</a> (FDMA)). It therefore required considerable <a href="bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> for a large number of users. In general terms, AMPS was very similar to the older "0G" <a href="Improved%20Mobile%20Telephone%20Service">Improved Mobile Telephone Service</a>, but used considerably more computing power in order to select frequencies, hand off conversations to <a href="PSTN">PSTN</a> lines, and handle billing and call setup.

What really separated AMPS from older systems is the "back end" call setup functionality. In AMPS, the cell centers could flexibly assign channels to handsets based on signal strength, allowing the same frequency to be re-used in various locations without interference. This allowed a larger number of phones to be supported over a geographical area. AMPS pioneers coined the term "cellular" because of its use of small hexagonal "cells" within a system.

AMPS suffered from many weaknesses compared to today's digital technologies. As an analog standard, it was susceptible to static and noise, and there was no protection from 'eavesdropping' using a <a href="Scanner%20%28radio%29">scanner</a>.

In the 1990s an epidemic of "cloning" cost the cellular carriers millions of dollars. An eavesdropper with specialized equipment could intercept a handset's <a href="Electronic%20Serial%20Number">ESN</a> (Electronic Serial Number) and MDN or CTN (Mobile Directory Number or Cellular Telephone Number). The Electronic Serial Number, a 12-digit number sent by the handset to the cellular system for billing purposes, uniquely identified that phone on the network. The system then allowed or disallowed calls and or features based on its customer file. A person intercepting an ESN/MDN pair could clone the combination onto a different phone and use it in other areas for making calls without paying.

Cellular <a href="phone%20cloning">phone cloning</a> became possible with off-the-shelf technology in the 1990s. Would-be cloners required three key items :


The radio, when tuned to the proper frequency, would receive the signal transmitted by the cell phone to be cloned, containing the phone's ESN/MDN pair. This signal would feed into the sound-card audio-input of the PC, and Banpaia would decode the ESN/MDN pair from this signal and display it on the screen. The hacker could then copy that data into the Oki 900 phone and reboot it, after which the phone network could not distinguish the Oki from the original phone whose signal had been received. This gave the cloner, through the Oki phone, the ability to use the mobile-phone service of the legitimate subscriber whose phone was cloned - just as if that phone had been physically stolen, except that the subscriber retained his or her phone, unaware that the phone had been cloned—at least until that subscriber received his or her next bill.

The problem became so large that some carriers required the use of a <a href="Personal%20identification%20number">PIN</a> before making calls. Eventually, the cellular companies initiated a system called RF Fingerprinting, whereby it could determine subtle differences in the signal of one phone from another and shut down some cloned phones. Some legitimate customers had problems with this though if they made certain changes to their own phone, such as replacing the battery and/or antenna. The Oki 900, the ultimate tool of cell-phone hackers, could listen in to AMPS phone-calls right out-of-the-box with no hardware modifications.

AMPS was originally standardized by <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI) as EIA/TIA/IS-3. EIA/TIA/IS-3 was superseded by EIA/TIA-553 and TIA interim standard with digital technologies, the cost of wireless service is so low that the problem of cloning has virtually disappeared.

AMPS cellular service operated in the 850 <a href="MHz">MHz</a> <a href="Cellular%20frequencies">Cellular</a> band. For each market area, the United States <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) allowed two licensees (networks) known as "A" and "B" carriers. Each carrier within a market used a specified "block" of frequencies consisting of 21 control channels and 395 voice channels. Originally, the B (wireline) side license was usually owned by the local phone company, and the A (non-wireline) license was given to wireless telephone providers.

At the inception of cellular in 1983, the FCC had granted each carrier within a market 333 channel pairs (666 channels total). By the late 1980s, the cellular industry's subscriber base had grown into the millions across America and it became necessary to add channels for additional capacity. In 1989, the FCC granted carriers an expansion from the previous 666 channels to the final 832 (416 pairs per carrier). The additional frequencies were from the band held in reserve for future (inevitable) expansion. These frequencies were immediately adjacent to the existing cellular band. These bands had previously been allocated to UHF TV channels 70–83.

Each duplex channel was composed of 2 <a href="frequency">frequencies</a>. 416 of these were in the 824–849 MHz range for transmissions from mobile stations to the base stations, paired with 416 frequencies in the 869–894 MHz range for transmissions from base stations to the mobile stations. Each cell site used a different subset of these channels than its neighbors to avoid interference. This significantly reduced the number of channels available at each site in real-world systems. Each AMPS channel had a one way bandwidth of 30 kHz, for a total of 60 kHz for each duplex channel.

Laws were passed in the US which prohibited the FCC <a href="type%20acceptance">type acceptance</a> and sale of any receiver which could tune the frequency ranges occupied by analog AMPS cellular services. Though the service is no longer offered, these laws remain in force.

Later, many AMPS networks were partially converted to <a href="D-AMPS">D-AMPS</a>, often referred to as TDMA (though <a href="Time%20division%20multiple%20access">TDMA</a> is a generic term that applies to many 2G cellular systems). D-AMPS, commercial deployed since 1993, was a <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a>, <a href="2G">2G</a> standard used mainly by <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Mobility">AT&T Mobility</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Cellular">U.S. Cellular</a> in the United States, <a href="Rogers%20Wireless">Rogers Wireless</a> in Canada, <a href="Telcel">Telcel</a> in Mexico, <a href="Telecom%20Italia%20Mobile">Telecom Italia Mobile</a> (TIM) in Brazil, <a href="VimpelCom">VimpelCom</a> in Russia, <a href="Movilnet">Movilnet</a> in Venezuela, and <a href="Cellcom%20%28Israel%29">Cellcom</a> in Israel. In most areas, D-AMPS is no longer offered and has been replaced by more advanced digital wireless networks.

AMPS and D-AMPS have now been phased out in favor of either <a href="CDMA2000">CDMA2000</a> or <a href="GSM">GSM</a>, which allow for higher capacity data transfers for services such as <a href="Wireless%20Application%20Protocol">WAP</a>, <a href="Multimedia%20Messaging%20System">Multimedia Messaging System</a> (MMS), and wireless Internet access. There are some phones capable of supporting AMPS, D-AMPS and GSM all in one phone (using the <a href="GAIT%20%28wireless%29">GAIT</a> standard).

In 2002, the FCC decided to no longer require A and B carriers to support AMPS service as of February 18, 2008. All AMPS carriers have converted to a digital standard such as CDMA2000 or GSM. Digital technologies such as GSM and CDMA2000 support multiple voice calls on the same channel and offer enhanced features such as two-way text messaging and data services.

Unlike in the United States, the <a href="Canadian%20Radio-television%20and%20Telecommunications%20Commission">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</a> (CRTC) and <a href="Industry%20Canada">Industry Canada</a> have not set any requirement for maintaining AMPS service in Canada. <a href="Rogers%20Wireless">Rogers Wireless</a> has dismantled their AMPS (along with <a href="IS-136">IS-136</a>) network; the networks were shut down May 31, 2007. <a href="Bell%20Mobility">Bell Mobility</a> and <a href="Telus%20Mobility">Telus Mobility</a>, who operated AMPS networks in Canada, announced that they would observe the same timetable as outlined by the FCC in the United States, and as a result would not begin to dismantle their AMPS networks until after February 2008.

<a href="OnStar">OnStar</a> relied heavily on North American AMPS service for its subscribers because, when the system was developed, AMPS offered the most comprehensive wireless coverage in the US. In 2006, <a href="ADT%20Security%20Services">ADT</a> asked the FCC to extend the AMPS deadline due to many of their alarm systems still using analog technology to communicate with the control centers. Cellular companies who own an A or B license (such as Verizon and Alltel) were required to provide analog service until February 18, 2008. After that point, however, most cellular companies were eager to shut down AMPS and use the remaining channels for digital services. <a href="OnStar">OnStar</a> transitioned to digital service with the help of data transport technology developed by Airbiquity, but warned customers who could not be upgraded to digital service that their service would permanently expire on January 1, 2008.

Aerodynamics

Aerodynamics, from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἀήρ "aer" (air) + δυναμική (dynamics), the study of the motion of <a href="air">air</a>, particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an <a href="airplane">airplane</a> wing. Aerodynamics is a sub-field of <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> and <a href="gas%20dynamics">gas dynamics</a>, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term "aerodynamics" is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that "gas dynamics" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. 
The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a> were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving <a href="Aircraft%23Heavier%20than%20air%20%E2%80%93%20aerodynes">heavier-than-air flight</a>, which was first demonstrated by <a href="Otto%20Lilienthal">Otto Lilienthal</a> in 1891. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through <a href="mathematical">mathematical</a> analysis, empirical approximations, <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> experimentation, and <a href="computer%20simulation">computer simulation</a>s has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to <a href="compressible%20flow">compressible flow</a>, <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a>, and <a href="boundary%20layer">boundary layer</a>s and has become increasingly <a href="Computational%20fluid%20dynamics">computational</a> in nature.

Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills, and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history, such as the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> legend of <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a> and <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a>. Fundamental concepts of <a href="Continuum%20mechanics">continuum</a>, <a href="Aerodynamic%20drag">drag</a>, and <a href="pressure%20gradient">pressure gradient</a>s appear in the work of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>.

In 1726, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a> became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance, making him one of the first aerodynamicists. <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a>-<a href="Switzerland">Swiss</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="Daniel%20Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a> followed in 1738 with "Hydrodynamica" in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as <a href="Bernoulli%27s%20principle">Bernoulli's principle</a>, which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift. In 1757, <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> published the more general <a href="Euler%20equations%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">Euler equations</a> which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows. The Euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s, resulting in the <a href="Navier-Stokes%20equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a>. The Navier-Stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes.

In 1799, <a href="George%20Cayley">Sir George Cayley</a> became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight (<a href="weight">weight</a>, <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>, <a href="Aerodynamic%20drag">drag</a>, and <a href="thrust">thrust</a>), as well as the relationships between them, and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century. In 1871, <a href="Francis%20Herbert%20Wenham">Francis Herbert Wenham</a> constructed the first <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a>, allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces. Drag theories were developed by <a href="Jean%20le%20Rond%20d%27Alembert">Jean le Rond d'Alembert</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Kirchhoff">Gustav Kirchhoff</a>, and <a href="John%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a>. In 1889, <a href="Charles%20Renard">Charles Renard</a>, a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. <a href="Otto%20Lilienthal">Otto Lilienthal</a>, the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag. Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a> flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Lanchester">Frederick W. Lanchester</a>, <a href="Martin%20Wilhelm%20Kutta">Martin Wilhelm Kutta</a>, and <a href="Nikolay%20Yegorovich%20Zhukovsky">Nikolai Zhukovsky</a> independently created theories that connected <a href="Circulation%20%28fluid%20dynamics%29">circulation</a> of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, <a href="Ludwig%20Prandtl">Ludwig Prandtl</a> is credited with developing the mathematics behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with <a href="boundary%20layer">boundary layer</a>s.

As aircraft speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air <a href="compressibility">compressibility</a> at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound. The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>s, and the threat of structural failure due to <a href="Aeroelasticity">aeroelastic flutter</a>. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a> after <a href="Ernst%20Mach">Ernst Mach</a> who was one of the first to investigate the properties of <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> flow. <a href="William%20John%20Macquorn%20Rankine">William John Macquorn Rankine</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Henri%20Hugoniot">Pierre Henri Hugoniot</a> independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>, while <a href="Jakob%20Ackeret">Jakob Ackeret</a> led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils. <a href="Theodore%20von%20K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n">Theodore von Kármán</a> and <a href="Hugh%20Latimer%20Dryden">Hugh Latimer Dryden</a> introduced the term <a href="transonic">transonic</a> to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using the <a href="Bell%20X-1">Bell X-1</a> aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft. <a href="Computational%20fluid%20dynamics">Computational fluid dynamics</a> began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions. Understanding of <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> and <a href="hypersonic">hypersonic</a> aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Understanding the motion of air around an object (often called a flow field) enables the calculation of forces and <a href="Moment%20%28physics%29">moments</a> acting on the object. In many aerodynamics problems, the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight: <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>, <a href="Aerodynamic%20drag">drag</a>, <a href="thrust">thrust</a>, and <a href="weight">weight</a>. Of these, lift and drag are aerodynamic forces, i.e. forces due to air flow over a solid body. Calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum. Continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as <a href="flow%20velocity">flow velocity</a>, <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, <a href="density">density</a>, and <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, which may be functions of position and time. These properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass, <a href="momentum">momentum</a>, and energy in air flows. Density, flow velocity, and an additional property, <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>, are used to classify flow fields.

Flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound. Transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound. Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere. A fourth classification, hypersonic flow, refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow.

<a href="Compressibility">Compressible flow</a> accounts for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density is assumed to be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are compressible, and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.

Viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow. In some flow fields, viscous effects are very small, and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects. These approximations are called inviscid flows. Flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows. Finally, aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment. External aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes (e.g. around an airplane wing), while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects (e.g. through a jet engine).

Unlike liquids and solids, gases are composed of discrete <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a <a href="Continuum%20mechanics">continuum</a>. This assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.

The validity of the <a href="continuum%20assumption">continuum assumption</a> is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the <a href="mean%20free%20path">mean free path</a> length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000 ft/90 km) or satellites in <a href="Low%20Earth%20orbit">Low Earth orbit</a>. In those cases, <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The <a href="Knudsen%20number">Knudsen number</a> can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.

The assumption of a <a href="Continuum%20mechanics">fluid continuum</a> allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using <a href="Fluid%20dynamics%23Conservation%20laws">fluid dynamics conservation laws</a>. Three conservation principles are used: 

The <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a> or another such <a href="equation%20of%20state">equation of state</a> is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables.

Aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow, including <a href="flow%20speed">flow speed</a>, <a href="compressibility">compressibility</a>, and <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>. "External" aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes. Evaluating the <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> and <a href="Drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a> on an <a href="airplane">airplane</a> or the <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>s that form in front of the nose of a <a href="rocket">rocket</a> are examples of external aerodynamics. "Internal" aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects. For instance, internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a> or through an <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> pipe.

Aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the <a href="flow%20speed">flow speed</a> is below, near or above the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a>. A problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound, <a href="transonic">transonic</a> if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present (normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound), <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a> when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound, and <a href="hypersonic">hypersonic</a> when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound. Aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow; a rough definition considers flows with <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a>s above 5 to be hypersonic.

The influence of <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> on the flow dictates a third classification. Some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects, in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible. The approximations to these problems are called <a href="inviscid%20flow">inviscid flow</a>s. Flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows.

An incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space. Although all real fluids are compressible, a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results. This is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound. Effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound. The <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a> is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed, otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included.

Subsonic (or low-speed) aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is <a href="inviscid">inviscid</a>, <a href="Compressibility">incompressible</a> and <a href="irrotational">irrotational</a>. This case is called <a href="potential%20flow">potential flow</a> and allows the <a href="differential%20equations">differential equations</a> that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a>, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions.

In solving a subsonic problem, one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of <a href="density">density</a> in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called compressible. In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a> in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102 m) per second or 228 miles (366 km) per hour at 60 °F (16 °C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics.

According to the theory of aerodynamics, a flow is considered to be compressible if the <a href="density">density</a> changes along a <a href="Streamlines%2C%20streaklines%20and%20pathlines">streamline</a>. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a> in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the <a href="stagnation%20point">stagnation point</a> (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.

The term Transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> (generally taken as <a href="Mach%20Number">Mach</a> 0.8–1.2). It is defined as the range of speeds between the <a href="critical%20mach">critical Mach number</a>, when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become <a href="supersonic">supersonic</a>, and a higher speed, typically near <a href="Mach%20number">Mach 1.2</a>, when all of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds, some of the airflow is supersonic, while some of the airflow is not supersonic.

Supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound. Calculating the lift on the <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem.

Supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow. Fluids react to differences in pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is "told" to respond to its environment. Therefore, since <a href="sound">sound</a> is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that "information" can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a <a href="stagnation%20pressure">stagnation pressure</a> as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid "knows" the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – <a href="temperature">temperature</a>, <a href="density">density</a>, <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, and <a href="Mach%20number">Mach number</a>—in an extremely violent and <a href="reversible%20process%20%28thermodynamics%29">irreversible</a> fashion called a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see <a href="Reynolds%20number">Reynolds number</a>) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.

In aerodynamics, hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime. Hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.

The incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary layers and turbulence.

The concept of a <a href="boundary%20layer">boundary layer</a> is important in many problems in aerodynamics. The viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer. This assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically.

In aerodynamics, turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow. These include low momentum diffusion, high momentum convection, and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time. Flow that is not turbulent is called <a href="laminar%20flow">laminar flow</a>.

Aerodynamics is important in a number of applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of <a href="Automotive%20engineering">vehicle design</a>, including <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s. It is important in the prediction of forces and moments acting on <a href="sailing">sailing vessels</a>. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a> heads. <a href="Structural%20engineering">Structural engineers</a> also use aerodynamics, and particularly <a href="aeroelasticity">aeroelasticity</a>, to calculate <a href="wind">wind</a> loads in the design of large buildings and <a href="bridge">bridge</a>s. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help <a href="Urban%20planning">town planners</a> and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">atmospheric circulation</a> and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in <a href="HVAC">heating/ventilation</a>, <a href="Duct%20%28HVAC%29">gas piping</a>, and in <a href="Internal%20combustion%20engine">automotive engines</a> where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.
People who do <a href="wind%20turbine%20design">wind turbine design</a> use aerodynamics.
A few aerodynamic equations are used as part of <a href="numerical%20weather%20prediction">numerical weather prediction</a>.

Andreas Schlüter

Andreas Schlüter (1659 or 1660; May 1714) was a <a href="Germans">German</a> <a href="baroque">baroque</a> <a href="sculptor">sculptor</a> and <a href="architect">architect</a>, active in <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.

Andreas Schlüter was born probably in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> His early life is obscure as at least three different persons of that name are documented. The records of <a href="St.%20Michaelis%20Church%2C%20Hamburg">St. Michaelis Church, Hamburg</a> show that an Andreas Schlüter, son of sculptor Gerhart Schlüter, had been baptized there on 22 May 1664. Documents from <a href="History%20of%20Gda%C5%84sk">Danzig</a> (Gdańsk) reported that an Andreas Schlüter "(senior)" had worked 1640-1652 in Danzig's Jopengasse lane (today's ulica Piwna). Possibly born in 1640, an "Andres Schliter" is recorded as apprentice on 9 May 1656 by the mason's guild. Other sources state 1659 as year of birth.

He probably did spend several years abroad as <a href="Journeyman">Journeyman</a>. His first work, in 1675, may have been epitaphs of the Dukes <a href="Sambor%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Pomerania">Sambor</a> and <a href="Mestwin%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Pomerania">Mestwin</a> in the dome of <a href="Pelplin%20monastery">Pelplin monastery</a>.

Schlüter's first known work was the decoration of the <a href="facade">facade</a> of the <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> Royal Chapel, in 1681. He later created statues for King <a href="John%20III%20Sobieski">John III Sobieski</a>'s <a href="Wilan%C3%B3w%20Palace">Wilanów Palace</a> in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> and sepulchral sculptures in <a href="Zhovkva%20Castle">Żółkiew (Zhovkva)</a>. In 1689, he moved to Warsaw and made the <a href="pediment">pediment</a> reliefs and sculptural work of <a href="Jan%20Dobrogost%20Krasi%C5%84ski">Krasiński Palace</a>.

Schlüter was invited to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1694 by <a href="Eberhard%20von%20Danckelmann">Eberhard von Danckelmann</a> to work as court sculptor at the <a href="Zeughaus">armory ("Zeughaus")</a> for Elector <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick III</a>. His sculpted decorations are a masterpiece of baroque expression and <a href="pathos">pathos</a>. While the more visible reliefs on the outside had to praise fighting, the statues of dying warriors in the interior denounced war and gave an indication of his pacifist religious beliefs (he is said to have been a <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>). Travelling through <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1696, he studied the work of masters like <a href="Michelangelo%20Buonarroti">Michelangelo Buonarroti</a> and <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Gian Lorenzo Bernini</a>.

Schlüter also worked as an architect and built many state buildings in Berlin in his role as "Hofbaumeister" (Court Architect), which he lost when one tower showed signs of a weak fundament. He also served as director of the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Prussian Academy of Arts</a> from 1702 to 1704, after which he began concentrating on sculpting again, as "Hofbildhauer" (Court Sculptor). His most important <a href="equestrian%20sculpture">equestrian sculpture</a> is that of the "Great Elector", <a href="Frederick%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick William of Brandenburg</a>, cast in 1708 and placed at "Lange Brücke" near the <a href="Berlin%20City%20Palace">Berlin City Palace</a>, now situated in the honor court before <a href="Charlottenburg%20Palace">Charlottenburg Palace</a>.

The Berlin City Palace, and many of his works, were partially destroyed by bombing in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and by the subsequent <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">Communist regime</a>. A similar fate probably befell the <a href="Amber%20Room">Amber Room</a>, made between 1701 and 1709, Schlüter's most famous work of architecture.

In 1713 Schlüter's fame brought him to work for Tsar <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, where he died of an illness after creating several designs. Together with <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Braunstein">Johann Friedrich Braunstein</a>, he designed the <a href="Peterhof%20Grand%20Palace">Grand Palace</a> and <a href="Monplaisir%20Palace">Monplaisir Palace</a> in <a href="Peterhof%20Palace%20Complex">Peterhof Palace Complex</a>. Also the city's oldest building, <a href="Kikin%20Hall">Kikin Hall</a>, and the reliefs at the <a href="Summer%20Palace%20%28Saint%20Petersburg%29">Summer Palace</a> are attributed to him. This way he became an important figure of <a href="Petrine%20Baroque">Petrine Baroque</a>.

<doc id="2823" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2823" title="Antiderivative">
Antiderivative

In <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, an antiderivative, primitive function, primitive integral or indefinite integral of a <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> is a differentiable function whose <a href="derivative">derivative</a> is equal to the original function . This can be stated symbolically as ′ . The process of solving for antiderivatives is called antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration) and its opposite operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a derivative.

Antiderivatives are related to <a href="integral">definite integral</a>s through the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>: the definite integral of a function over an interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.

The discrete equivalent of the notion of antiderivative is <a href="antidifference">antidifference</a>.

The function "F"("x") = "x"/3 is an antiderivative of "f"("x") = "x", as the derivative of "x"/3 is "x". As the derivative of a <a href="Constant%20function">constant</a> is <a href="0%20%28number%29">zero</a>, "x" will have an <a href="Infinite%20set">infinite</a> number of antiderivatives, such as "x"/3, "x"/3 + 1, "x"/3 - 2, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of "x" can be obtained by changing the value of C in "F"("x") = "x"/3 + "C"; where "C" is an arbitrary constant known as the <a href="constant%20of%20integration">constant of integration</a>. Essentially, the <a href="graph%20of%20a%20function">graphs</a> of antiderivatives of a given function are <a href="vertical%20translation">vertical translation</a>s of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the <a href="Value%20%28mathematics%29">value</a> of "C".

In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).

Antiderivatives are important because they can be used to <a href="integral%23Calculating%20integrals">compute definite integrals</a>, using the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>: if "F" is an antiderivative of the <a href="Riemann%20integral">integrable</a> function "f" over the interval then:

Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function "f" is sometimes called the "general integral" or "indefinite integral" of "f" and is written using the integral symbol with no bounds:

If "F" is an antiderivative of "f", and the function "f" is defined on some <a href="interval%20%28mathematics%29">interval</a>, then every other antiderivative "G" of "f" differs from "F" by a constant: there exists a number "C" such that "G"("x") = "F"("x") + "C" for all "x". "C" is called the <a href="constant%20of%20integration">constant of integration</a>. If the domain of "F" is a <a href="disjoint%20union">disjoint union</a> of two or more intervals, then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance

is the most general antiderivative of formula_4 on its natural domain formula_5

Every <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a> "f" has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative "F" is given by the definite integral of "f" with variable upper boundary:
Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives). This is another formulation of the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a>.

There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of <a href="elementary%20function">elementary function</a>s (like <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s, <a href="exponential%20function">exponential function</a>s, <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>s, <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a>, <a href="inverse%20trigonometric%20functions">inverse trigonometric functions</a> and their combinations). Examples of these are
"From left to right, the first four are the <a href="error%20function">error function</a>, the <a href="Fresnel%20function">Fresnel function</a>, the <a href="trigonometric%20integral">trigonometric integral</a>, and the <a href="logarithmic%20integral%20function">logarithmic integral function</a>."

See also <a href="Differential%20Galois%20theory">Differential Galois theory</a> for a more detailed discussion.

Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives. For some elementary functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. See the articles on <a href="Elementary%20function%20%28differential%20algebra%29">elementary functions</a> and <a href="nonelementary%20integral">nonelementary integral</a> for further information.

There are various methods available:


<a href="Computer%20algebra%20system">Computer algebra system</a>s can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a <a href="table%20of%20integrals">table of integrals</a>.

Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is known that:

Alphabet song

An alphabet song is any of various songs used to teach children the <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>. Alphabet songs typically follow the <a href="alphabetic%20principle">alphabetic principle</a> (though the <a href="phonics">phonics</a> method offers variants). In languages such as <a href="English%20language">English</a> with <a href="morphophonemic">morphophonemic</a> variation (e.g. "cake" is , not ), an alphabet song usually chooses a particular <a href="pronunciation">pronunciation</a> for each letter in the alphabet and also typically for some words in the song.

"The A.B.C." or "A.B.Cs" is one of the best-known <a href="English%20language">English language</a> alphabet songs, and perhaps the one most frequently referred to as "the alphabet song", especially in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.
The song was first copyrighted in 1835 by the <a href="Boston">Boston</a>-based music publisher <a href="Charles%20Bradlee">Charles Bradlee</a>, and given the title "The A.B.C., a German air with variations for the flute with an easy accompaniment for the piano forte". The musical arrangement was attributed to <a href="Louis%20Le%20Maire">Louis Le Maire</a> (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was "Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C. Bradlee, in the clerk's office of the District Court of Massachusetts", according to the Newberry Library, which also says, "The theme is that used by <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> for his <a href="Twelve%20Variations%20on%20%26quot%3BAh%20vous%20dirai-je%2C%20Maman%26quot%3B">piano variations, Ah, vous dirai-je, maman</a>." This tune is the same as the tune for "<a href="Twinkle%2C%20Twinkle%2C%20Little%20Star">Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</a>" and "<a href="Baa%2C%20Baa%2C%20Black%20Sheep">Baa, Baa, Black Sheep</a>".

Lyrics: "(each line represents two measures, or eight beats)"

In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Z">Z</a> is pronounced "zee"; in most other English-speaking countries (such as Canada, the UK and Australia) it is pronounced "zed". Generally, the absent "zee"-rhyme is not missed, although some children use a "zee" pronunciation in the rhyme which they would not use elsewhere. Variants of the song exist to accommodate the "zed" pronunciation. One variation shortens the second line and lengthens the last, to form a near-rhyme between <a href="N">N</a> and zed:

Alternate Zed Version:

Another alternate Zed version:

Note that the third line is lengthened and the fourth line is shortened, to compensate for the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> pronunciations.

A French-language version of the song is also taught in Canada, with generally no alterations to the melody except in the final line that requires adjustment to accommodate the two-syllable pronunciation of the French "y".

Because the English language has 40 sounds and only 26 letters, children and beginning readers also need to learn the different sounds (<a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s) associated with each letter. Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.

There are also songs that go through the alphabet, making some of the letters stand for something in the process. An example, "<a href="A%2C%20You%27re%20Adorable">A, You're Adorable</a>" (also known as "The Alphabet Love Song"), was recorded in 1948, by <a href="Buddy%20Kaye">Buddy Kaye</a>, <a href="Fred%20Wise%20%28lyricist%29">Fred Wise</a>, <a href="Sidney%20Lippman">Sidney Lippman</a>, and later <a href="Perry%20Como">Perry Como</a>.

A newer example of this is from the musical "<a href="Matilda%20the%20Musical">Matilda</a>". "School Song" is an acrostic that spells out the alphabet phonetically.

The group <a href="Wee%20Sing">Wee Sing</a> released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order, called "ZYXs".

The Canadian children's TV series "<a href="The%20Big%20Comfy%20Couch">The Big Comfy Couch</a>" used a version of the song in the first episode of Season 4, "Backwards".

Comedian <a href="Soupy%20Sales">Soupy Sales</a> released a song in 1966 called "Backwards Alphabet" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style. The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with the <a href="Smothers%20Brothers">Smothers Brothers</a> in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of "Alice Through the Looking Glass".

The Antigonid dynasty (; ) was a dynasty of <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> kings descended from <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>'s general <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus I Monophthalmus</a> ("the One-eyed").

Succeeding the <a href="Antipatrid%20dynasty">Antipatrid dynasty</a> in much of Macedonia, Antigonus ruled mostly over Asia Minor and northern Syria. His attempts to take control of the whole of Alexander's empire led to his defeat and death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ipsus">Battle of Ipsus</a> in 301 BC. Antigonus's son <a href="Demetrius%20I%20Poliorcetes">Demetrius I Poliorcetes</a> survived the battle, and managed to seize control of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a> itself a few years later, but eventually lost his throne, dying as a prisoner of <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus I Nicator</a>. After a period of confusion, Demetrius's son <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Gonatas">Antigonus II Gonatas</a> was able to establish the family's control over the old Kingdom of Macedon, as well as over most of the Greek city-states, by 276 BC.

It was one of four dynasties established by Alexander's successors, the others being the <a href="List%20of%20Seleucid%20rulers">Seleucid dynasty</a>, <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> and <a href="Attalid%20dynasty">Attalid dynasty</a>.

Abjuration

Abjuration is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon <a href="oath">oath</a>, often the <a href="renunciation%20of%20citizenship">renunciation of citizenship</a> or some other <a href="right">right</a> or <a href="Privilege%20%28legal%20ethics%29">privilege</a>. The term comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "abjurare", "to forswear".

Abjuration of the realm was a type of abjuration in ancient <a href="English%20law">English law</a>. The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly, never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken <a href="Sanctuary%23Legal%20sanctuary">sanctuary</a>:

Near the start of the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed "An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements." The enlargements included an oath which became known as the "Oath of Abjuration":
In 1656-7, it was reissued in what was for Catholics an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be "adjudged a Papist" who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the <a href="Recusancy">recusant</a>'s goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right.

The <a href="Catholic%20Encyclopaedia">Catholic Encyclopaedia</a> make the point that the oath and the penalties were so severe that it stopped the efforts of the <a href="Gallicanism">Gallicanizing party</a> among the English Catholics, who had been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which was condemned anew about this time by Pope <a href="Innocent%20X">Innocent X</a>.

In England (and after 1707 Great Britain) the Oath of Abjuration denied the royal title of James II's heirs (i.e. the direct Catholic descendent of the House of Stuart exiled after the Glorious Revolution in 1688). In <a href="England">England</a>, an Oath of Abjuration was taken by <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Members of Parliament</a>, clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British monarch</a> and repudiated the right of the <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuarts</a> and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> and <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>. It was superseded by the <a href="oath%20of%20allegiance">oath of allegiance</a>. In Ireland the oath was imposed of state office holders, teachers and lawyers, and on clergy of the established church in from 1703, the following year it was on all Irish voters and from 1709 it could be demanded of any adult male by a magistrate.

Another famous abjuration was brought about by the <a href="Act%20of%20Abjuration">Plakkaat van Verlatinghe</a> of July 26, 1581, the formal <a href="declaration%20of%20independence">declaration of independence</a> of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> from the <a href="Spanish%20monarchy">Spanish king</a>, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a>.

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects (1792), written by the 18th-century British <a href="proto-feminist">proto-feminist</a> <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, is one of the earliest works of <a href="feminist%20philosophy">feminist philosophy</a>. In it, Wollstonecraft responds to those educational and political theorists of the 18th century who did not believe women should have an education. She argues that women ought to have an education commensurate with their position in society, claiming that women are essential to the nation because they educate its children and because they could be "companions" to their husbands, rather than mere wives. Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men.

Wollstonecraft was prompted to write the "Rights of Woman" after reading <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</a>'s 1791 report to the French <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Assembly</a>, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to indulge in excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the "Rights of Woman" hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.

While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal. Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her. Although it is commonly assumed now that the "Rights of Woman" was unfavourably received, this is a modern misconception based on the belief that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>'s "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). The "Rights of Woman" was actually well received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it "perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century".

"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" was written against the tumultuous background of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the debates that it spawned in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the "<a href="Revolution%20Controversy">Revolution Controversy</a>", British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state, many of these issues having been raised in France first. Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>", a response to <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790). In his "Reflections", Burke criticised the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution. While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain's own <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> (1642–1651) in which <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649. He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In "Reflections" he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilisation is the result of social and political consensus; its traditions cannot be continually challenged—the result would be anarchy. One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft's "Rights of Men", published just six weeks after Burke's "Reflections", is that rights cannot be based on tradition; rights, she argues, should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, regardless of their basis in tradition.

When <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord</a> presented his "Rapport sur l'instruction publique" (1791) to the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28French%20Revolution%29">National Assembly</a> in France, Wollstonecraft was galvanised to respond. In his recommendations for a national system of education, Talleyrand had written:

Let us bring up women, not to aspire to advantages which the Constitution denies them, but to know and appreciate those which it guarantees them . . . Men are destined to live on the stage of the world. A public education suits them: it early places before their eyes all the scenes of life: only the proportions are different. The paternal home is better for the education of women; they have less need to learn to deal with the interests of others, than to accustom themselves to a calm and secluded life.
Wollstonecraft dedicated the "Rights of Woman" to Talleyrand: "Having read with great pleasure a pamphlet which you have lately published, I dedicate this volume to you; to induce you to reconsider the subject, and maturely weigh what I have advanced respecting the rights of woman and national education." At the end of 1791, French feminist <a href="Olympe%20de%20Gouges">Olympe de Gouges</a> had published her "<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman%20and%20the%20Female%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen</a>", and the question of women's rights became central to political debates in both France and Britain.

The "Rights of Woman" is an extension of Wollstonecraft's arguments in the "Rights of Men". In the "Rights of Men", as the title suggests, she is concerned with the rights of particular men (18th-century British men) while in the "Rights of Woman", she is concerned with the rights afforded to "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter of the "Rights of Woman" addresses the issue of <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. "The Rights of Woman" thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by <a href="Political%20philosophy">political philosophers</a> such as <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.

Wollstonecraft did not employ the formal argumentation or logical prose style common to 18th-century philosophical writing when composing her own works. The "Rights of Woman" is a long essay that introduces all of its major topics in the opening chapters and then repeatedly returns to them, each time from a different point of view. It also adopts a hybrid tone that combines rational argument with the fervent rhetoric of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>.

In the 18th century, "sensibility" was a physical phenomenon that came to be attached to a specific set of moral beliefs. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with sensibility could easily sympathise with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the <a href="abolitionism">movement to abolish the slave trade</a>. But sensibility also paralysed those who had too much of it; as scholar G. J. Barker-Benfield explains, "an innate refinement of nerves was also identifiable with greater suffering, with weakness, and a susceptibility to disorder".

By the time Wollstonecraft was writing the "Rights of Woman", sensibility had already been under sustained attack for a number of years. Sensibility, which had initially promised to draw individuals together through sympathy, was now viewed as "profoundly separatist"; novels, plays, and poems that employed the language of sensibility asserted individual rights, sexual freedom, and unconventional familial relationships based only upon feeling. Furthermore, as <a href="Janet%20Todd">Janet Todd</a>, another scholar of sensibility, argues, "to many in Britain the cult of sensibility seemed to have feminized the nation, given women undue prominence, and emasculated men."

One of Wollstonecraft's central arguments in the "Rights of Woman" is that women should be educated in a rational manner to give them the opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and <a href="conduct%20book">conduct book</a> writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as <a href="Catharine%20Macaulay">Catharine Macaulay</a> and <a href="Hester%20Chapone">Hester Chapone</a>, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787), in her children's book, "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788), as well as in the "Rights of Woman".

Stating in her preface that "my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [consider] females rather as women than human creatures". Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as "spaniels" and "toys"). While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women might not be able to attain the same degree of knowledge that men do.

Wollstonecraft attacks conduct book writers such as <a href="James%20Fordyce">James Fordyce</a> and <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28moralist%29">John Gregory</a> as well as educational philosophers such as <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> who argue that a woman does not need a rational education. (Rousseau famously argues in "" (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men; Wollstonecraft, infuriated by this argument, attacks not only it but also Rousseau himself.) Intent on illustrating the limitations that contemporary educational theory placed upon women, Wollstonecraft writes, "taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison", implying that without this damaging ideology, which encourages young women to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, they could achieve much more. Wives could be the rational "companions" of their husbands and even pursue careers should they so choose: "women might certainly study the art of healing, and be physicians as well as nurses. And midwifery, decency seems to <a href="wikt%3Aallot">allot</a> to them . . . they might, also, study politics . . . Business of various kinds, they might likewise pursue."

For Wollstonecraft, "the most perfect education" is "an exercise of the understanding as is best calculated to strengthen the body and form the heart. Or, in other words, to enable the individual to attach such habits of virtue as will render it independent." In addition to her broad philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft lays out a specific plan for national education to counter <a href="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a>'s. In Chapter 12, "On National Education," she proposes that children be sent to <a href="day%20school">day school</a>s as well as given some education at home "to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures," and that such schools be free for children "five to nine years of age." She also maintains that schooling should be <a href="coeducation">co-educational</a>, contending that men and women, whose marriages are "the cement of society," should be "educated after the same model."

It is debatable to what extent the "Rights of Woman" is a <a href="feminist">feminist</a> text; because the definitions of "feminist" vary, different scholars have come to different conclusions. Wollstonecraft would never have referred to her text as feminist because the words "feminist" and "feminism" were not coined until the 1890s. Moreover, there was no <a href="feminist%20movement">feminist movement</a> to speak of during Wollstonecraft's lifetime. In the introduction to her seminal work on Wollstonecraft's thought, <a href="Barbara%20Taylor">Barbara Taylor</a> writes:

Describing [Wollstonecraft's philosophy] as feminist is problematic, and I do it only after much consideration. The label is of course anachronistic . . . Treating Wollstonecraft's thought as an anticipation of nineteenth and twentieth-century feminist argument has meant sacrificing or distorting some of its key elements. Leading examples of this . . . have been the widespread neglect of her religious beliefs, and the misrepresentation of her as a bourgeois liberal, which together have resulted in the displacement of a religiously inspired utopian radicalism by a secular, class-partisan reformism as alien to Wollstonecraft's political project as her dream of a divinely promised age of universal happiness is to our own. Even more important however has been the imposition on Wollstonecraft of a heroic-individualist brand of politics utterly at odds with her own ethically driven case for women's emancipation. Wollstonecraft's leading ambition for women was that they should attain virtue, and it was to this end that she sought their liberation.

In the "Rights of Woman", Wollstonecraft does not make the claim for gender equality using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men and women are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men and women are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men and women are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.

However, Wollstonecraft's arguments for equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously states:

Let it not be concluded, that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.
Moreover, Wollstonecraft calls on men, rather than women, to initiate the social and political changes she outlines in the "Rights of Woman". Because women are uneducated, they cannot alter their own situation—men must come to their aid. Wollstonecraft writes at the end of her chapter "Of the Pernicious Effects Which Arise from the Unnatural Distinctions Established in Society":

I then would <a href="wikt%3Afain">fain</a> convince reasonable men of the importance of some of my remarks; and prevail on them to weigh dispassionately the whole tenor of my observations. – I appeal to their understandings; and, as a fellow-creature, claim, in the name of my sex, some interest in their hearts. I entreat them to assist to emancipate their companion, to make her a help meet for them! Would men but generously snap our chains, and be content with rational fellowship instead of slavish obedience, they would find us more observant daughters, more affectionate sisters, more faithful wives, more reasonable mothers – in a word, better citizens.

It is Wollstonecraft's last novel, "" (1798), the fictionalised sequel to the "Rights of Woman", that is usually considered her most radical feminist work.

One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the "Rights of Woman" is against false and excessive <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, particularly in women. She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because these women are "the prey of their senses", they cannot think rationally. In fact, not only do they do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilisation: these are not women who can refine civilisation – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, the passions underpin all reason. This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels "" (1788) and "".

As part of her argument that women should not be overly influenced by their feelings, Wollstonecraft emphasises that they should not be constrained by or made slaves to their bodies or their sexual feelings. This particular argument has led many modern feminists to suggest that Wollstonecraft intentionally avoids granting women any sexual desire. Cora Kaplan argues that the "negative and prescriptive assault on female sexuality" is a ""<a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>"" of the "Rights of Woman". For example, Wollstonecraft advises her readers to "calmly let passion subside into friendship" in the ideal companionate marriage (that is, in the ideal of a love-based marriage that was developing at the time). It would be better, she writes, when "two virtuous young people marry . . . if some circumstances checked their passion". According to Wollstonecraft, "love and friendship cannot subsist in the same bosom". As Mary Poovey explains, "Wollstonecraft betrays her fear that female desire might in fact court man's lascivious and degrading attentions, that the subordinate position women have been given might even be deserved. Until women can transcend their fleshly desires and fleshly forms, they will be hostage to the body." If women are not interested in sexuality, they cannot be dominated by men. Wollstonecraft worries that women are consumed with "romantic wavering", that is, they are interested only in satisfying their lusts. Because the "Rights of Woman" eliminates sexuality from a woman's life, Kaplan contends, it "expresses a violent antagonism to the sexual" while at the same time "exaggerat[ing] the importance of the sensual in the everyday life of women". Wollstonecraft was so determined to wipe sexuality from her picture of the ideal woman that she ended up foregrounding it by insisting upon its absence. But as Kaplan and others have remarked, Wollstonecraft may have been forced to make this sacrifice: "it is important to remember that the notion of woman as politically enabled and independent [was] fatally linked [during the eighteenth century] to the unrestrained and vicious exercise of her sexuality."

<a href="Claudia%20L.%20Johnson%20%28scholar%29">Claudia Johnson</a>, a prominent Wollstonecraft scholar, has called the "Rights of Woman" "a republican manifesto". Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the <a href="Commonwealth%20men">Commonwealth</a> tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a <a href="republicanism">republican</a> ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens. According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft "denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men". If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position open to them in society. Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Rights of Men</a>" and the "Rights of Woman", of the "masculinization of sensitivity" in such works as <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>'s "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>".

In the "Rights of Woman" Wollstonecraft adheres to a version of republicanism that includes a belief in the eventual overthrow of all titles, including the monarchy. She also briefly suggests that all men and women should be represented in government. But the bulk of her "political criticism," as Chris Jones, a Wollstonecraft scholar, explains, "is couched predominantly in terms of morality". Her definition of virtue focuses on the individual's happiness rather than, for example, the good of the entire society. This is reflected in her explanation of <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a>. Because rights ultimately proceed from God, Wollstonecraft maintains that there are duties, tied to those rights, incumbent upon each and every person. For Wollstonecraft, the individual is taught republicanism and benevolence within the family; domestic relations and familial ties are crucial to her understanding of social cohesion and patriotism.

In many ways the "Rights of Woman" is inflected by a <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> view of the world, as is its direct predecessor the "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Rights of Men</a>". Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle class, which she calls the "most natural state". She also frequently praises modesty and industry, virtues which, at the time, were associated with the middle class. From her position as a middle-class writer arguing for a middle-class ethos, Wollstonecraft also attacks the wealthy, criticising them using the same arguments she employs against women. She points out the "false-refinement, immorality, and vanity" of the rich, calling them "weak, artificial beings, raised above the common wants and affections of their race, in a premature unnatural manner [who] undermine the very foundation of virtue, and spread corruption through the whole mass of society".

But Wollstonecraft's criticisms of the wealthy do not necessarily reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor. For her, the poor are fortunate because they will never be trapped by the snares of wealth: "Happy is it when people have the cares of life to struggle with; for these struggles prevent their becoming a prey to enervating vices, merely from idleness!" Moreover, she contends that charity has only negative consequences because, as Jones puts it, she "sees it as sustaining an unequal society while giving the appearance of virtue to the rich".

In her national plan for education, she retains class distinctions (with an exception for the intelligent), suggesting that: "After the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual . . . The young people of superior abilities, or fortune, might now be taught, in another school, the dead and living languages, the elements of science, and continue the study of history and politics, on a more extensive scale, which would not exclude polite literature."

In attempting to navigate the cultural expectations of female writers and the generic conventions of political and philosophical discourse, Wollstonecraft, as she does throughout her "<a href="wikt%3Aoeuvre">oeuvre</a>", constructs a unique blend of masculine and feminine styles in the "Rights of Woman". She utilises the language of philosophy, referring to her work as a "treatise" with "arguments" and "principles". However, Wollstonecraft also uses a personal tone, employing "I" and "you", dashes and exclamation marks, and autobiographical references to create a distinctly feminine voice in the text. The "Rights of Woman" further hybridizes its genre by weaving together elements of the conduct book, the short essay, and the novel, genres often associated with women, while at the same time claiming that these genres could be used to discuss philosophical topics such as rights.

Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, the rhetoric of the "Rights of Woman" is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Rousseau</a>. For example, after excerpting a long passage from "" (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.

In her efforts to vividly describe the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to "capricious tyrants" who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides of the same coin. Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's "softness" has "debased mankind".

Wollstonecraft was forced to write the "Rights of Woman" hurriedly to respond to <a href="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a> and ongoing events. Upon completing the work, she wrote to her friend <a href="William%20Roscoe">William Roscoe</a>: "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject. – Do not suspect me of false modesty – I mean to say that had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, in every sense of the word . . . I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." When Wollstonecraft revised the "Rights of Woman" for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.

Wollstonecraft never wrote the second part to the "Rights of Woman," although <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> published her "Hints", which were "chiefly designed to have been incorporated in the second part of the "Vindication of the Rights of Woman"", in the posthumous collection of her works. However, she did begin writing the novel "", which most scholars consider a fictionalised sequel to the "Rights of Woman". It was unfinished at her death and also included in the "Posthumous Works" published by Godwin.

When it was first published in 1792, the "Rights of Woman" was reviewed favourably by the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", the "General Magazine", the "Literary Magazine", "New York Magazine", and the "Monthly Review", although the assumption persists even today that "Rights of Woman" received hostile reviews. It was almost immediately released in a second edition in 1792, several American editions appeared, and it was translated into French. Taylor writes that "it was an immediate success". Moreover, other writers such as <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a> and <a href="Mary%20Robinson%20%28poet%29">Mary Robinson</a> specifically alluded to Wollstonecraft's text in their own works. Hays cited the "Rights of Woman" in her novel "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20Emma%20Courtney">Memoirs of Emma Courtney</a>" (1796) and modelled her female characters after Wollstonecraft's ideal woman.

Although female conservatives such as <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a> excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on "Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work". During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a> and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the "Rights of Woman". The work also provoked outright hostility. The <a href="bluestocking">bluestocking</a> <a href="Elizabeth%20Carter">Elizabeth Carter</a> was unimpressed with the work. <a href="Thomas%20Taylor%20%28neoplatonist%29">Thomas Taylor</a>, the <a href="Neoplatonist">Neoplatonist</a> translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called "A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes": if women have rights, why not <a href="animal%20rights">animals too</a>?

After Wollstonecraft died in 1797, her husband <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> published his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1798). He revealed much about her private life that had previously not been known to the public: her illegitimate child, her love affairs, and her attempts at suicide. While Godwin believed he was portraying his wife with love, sincerity, and compassion, contemporary readers were shocked by Wollstonecraft's unorthodox lifestyle and she became a reviled figure. <a href="Richard%20Polwhele">Richard Polwhele</a> targeted her in particular in his anonymous long poem "<a href="The%20Unsex%27d%20Females">The Unsex'd Females</a>" (1798), a defensive reaction to women's literary self-assertion: Hannah More is Christ to Wollstonecraft's Satan. His poem was "well known" among the responses "A Vindication". One reviewer comments this "ingenious poem" with its "playful sallies of sarcastic wit" against "our modern ladies," though others found it "a tedious, lifeless piece of writing." Critical responses largely fell along clear-cut political lines.

Wollstonecraft's ideas became associated with her life story and women writers felt that it was dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her "Rights of Woman", for example, did not include her in the collection of "Illustrious and Celebrated Women" she published in 1803. <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel "<a href="Belinda%20%28Edgeworth%20novel%29">Belinda</a>" (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial to the development of the nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.

The negative views towards Wollstonecraft persisted for over a century. The "Rights of Woman" was not reprinted until the middle of the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a> wrote "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the "Rights of Woman" as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will be surprised to find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".
The <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a> (i.e. moderate reformer, as opposed to <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a>) <a href="Millicent%20Garrett%20Fawcett">Millicent Garrett Fawcett</a> wrote the introduction to the centenary edition of the "Rights of Woman", cleansing the memory of Wollstonecraft and claiming her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote. While the "Rights of Woman" may have paved the way for feminist arguments, 20th century feminists have tended to use Wollstonecraft's life story, rather than her texts, for inspiration; her unorthodox lifestyle convinced them to try new "experiments in living", as <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> termed it in her famous essay on Wollstonecraft. However, there is some evidence that the "Rights of Woman" may be influencing current feminists. <a href="Ayaan%20Hirsi%20Ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>, a feminist who is critical of <a href="Women%20and%20Islam">Islam's dictates regarding women</a>, cites the "Rights of Woman" in her autobiography "<a href="Infidel%20%28book%29">Infidel</a>", writing that she was "inspired by Mary Wollstonecraft, the pioneering feminist thinker who told women they had the same ability to reason as men did and deserved the same rights".

The Afghan Hound has been identified as a <a href="Dog%20breed%23Basal%20breeds">basal breed</a> that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. It is most closely related to the <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a>.

Today's modern purebred breed of Afghan Hound descends from dogs brought to Great Britain in the 1920s which <a href="King%20Amanullah">King Amanullah</a> of the <a href="Afghan%20Royal%20Family">Afghan Royal Family</a> gave away as gifts. Some had been kept as hunting dogs, others as guardians.

Although the breed is demonstrably ancient, verifiable written or visual records that tie today's Afghan Hound breed to specific Afghan owners or places are absent. There is much speculation about the breeds origin and possible connections with the ancient world among <a href="Animal%20fancy">fanciers</a> and in non-scientific breed books and breed websites. Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> area of <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>. Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the <a href="Barakzay">Barakzay</a>, or <a href="Kurram%20Valley">Kurram Valley</a> Hound.

There are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan, and some are being developed (through breeding and record keeping) into modern purebred breeds. As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often these <a href="landrace">landrace</a> types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past.

Once out of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the history of the Afghan Hound breed becomes an important part of the history of the very earliest dog shows and <a href="The%20Kennel%20Club">The Kennel Club</a> (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from <a href="British%20India">British India</a> (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds. They were also called "Persian Greyhounds" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.

One dog in particular, "Zardin", was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff, and became the early ideal of <a href="breed%20type">breed type</a> for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.

Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> from <a href="Balochistan%20%28Afghanistan%29">Baluchistan</a> by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the "Bell-Murray strain".

These dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her "Ghazni strain" were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain. The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.

The afghan hound can also come with a much more "patterned" coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray's and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often actually looking like a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular afghan hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.

The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, "Sirdar", won BIS at <a href="Crufts">Crufts</a> in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of <a href="Life%20Magazine">Life Magazine</a>, November 26, 1945. "Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s…and won most of the major shows". An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 <a href="World%20Dog%20Show">World Dog Show</a> in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the <a href="Westminster%20Kennel%20Club%20Dog%20Show">Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</a> in 1957 and again in 1983. That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell.

The Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of <a href="lure%20coursing">lure coursing</a>.

The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height and weighing . The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a <a href="melanistic%20mask">black facial mask</a>. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a <a href="Fu%20Manchu%20mustache">Fu Manchu mustache</a>. The mustache is called "mandarins." Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-color hounds (white with islands of red or black) are penalized in the AKC standard, but not by the FCI. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.

The temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hound can be a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion. Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.

The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow "obedience intelligence" as defined by author <a href="Stanley%20Coren">Stanley Coren</a> in "<a href="The%20Intelligence%20of%20Dogs%20%28book%29">The Intelligence of Dogs</a>".

Although seldom used today for hunting in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="United%20States">America</a> where they are popular, Afghan hounds are frequent participants in <a href="lure%20coursing">lure coursing</a> events and are also popular in the <a href="List%20of%20dog%20sports">sport</a> of <a href="conformation%20show">conformation show</a>ing.

The Khalag Tazi is a variety of the Afghan. It was introduced to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in 1920 when an <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back from <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. "Tazi" is a current and ancient name for <a href="hunting%20dog">hunting dog</a>s of the sighthound type in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. It has been used to denote the <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a>, Afghan, <a href="Taigan">Taigan</a>, <a href="Persian%20Greyhound">Persian Greyhound</a>, <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a> types of <a href="hound">hound</a>.

Afghan Hounds in UK surveys had an average lifespan of about 12 years. which is similar to other breeds of their size. In the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%). Those that die of old age had a median lifespan of 12 years, with 12% living to at least 14.

Major health issues are <a href="allergy">allergies</a>, <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, and <a href="hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">hip dysplasia</a>. Sensitivity to <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a> is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the <a href="sighthound">sighthound</a> group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop <a href="chylothorax">chylothorax</a>, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of <a href="Chyle">chyle fluid</a> to enter the dog's chest cavity. This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, "barrel"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often, fatal.

Because of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films and TV shows, including Universal Pictures' "<a href="Balto">Balto</a>" (Sylvie), Disney's "" (Ruby) and "<a href="Oliver%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Oliver & Company</a>" (Rita), an Afghan hound also appeared on "101 Dalmatians" as well as in "<a href="102%20Dalmatians">102 Dalmatians</a>" as one of the dogs in <a href="Cruella%20De%20Vil">Cruella De Vil</a>'s party and the television series <a href="What-a-Mess">What-a-Mess</a> (Prince Amir of Kinjan; based on children's books by <a href="Frank%20Muir">Frank Muir</a>) and, as Prissy in the 1961 <a href="Disney">Disney</a> animated film "<a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a>" and "". Brainy Barker from "<a href="Krypto%20the%20Superdog">Krypto the Superdog</a>" claims to be an Afghan Hound in the episode "Meet the Dog Stars", although her design actually resembles that of a <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a> instead of an Afghan Hound.

Afghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines. The Afghan hound is represented in books as well, including being featured in a series of mystery novels by Nina Wright (Abra), and a talking Afghan Hound in David Rothman's "The Solomon Scandals" (2008, Twilight Times Books). In the novel "<a href="Between%20the%20Acts">Between the Acts</a>", <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> uses an Afghan hound (named Sohrab) to represent aspects of one of the book's human characters.

On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist <a href="Hwang%20Woo-Suk">Hwang Woo-Suk</a> announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully <a href="cloning">clone</a> a dog, an Afghan Hound named <a href="Snuppy">Snuppy</a>. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.

The Afghan Hound features prominently in the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> <a href="music%20video">music video</a> of popular French band <a href="M83%20%28band%29">M83</a>'s, "Set in Stone (M83 Remix)".

Azawakh

The Azawakh is a <a href="sighthound">sighthound</a> <a href="Livestock%20guardian%20dog">livestock guardian</a> <a href="breed%20of%20dog">breed of dog</a> from <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>. It is also used as a <a href="hunting%20dog">hunting dog</a>, though relegated to a secondary function due to the lack of <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">game</a> in the region. With ancient origins, it is raised throughout the <a href="Sahel">Sahelian zone</a> of <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, and <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>. This region includes the <a href="Iullemmeden%20Basin">Azawagh Valley</a> for which the breed is named. While commonly associated with the nomadic <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg people</a>, they are also bred and owned by other <a href="List%20of%20ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa">ethnic groups</a> such as the <a href="Fula%20people">Peulh</a>, <a href="Ikelan">Bella</a>, and <a href="Hausa%20people">Hausa</a>. The Azawakh is more related to the <a href="Sloughi">Sloughi</a> than it is to the <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a>.

Morphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and South Indian sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant.

The standards call for a hound from ; its height is . The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are "dry", meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the <a href="Greyhound">Greyhound</a> and <a href="Whippet">Whippet</a>. In this respect it is similar in type to the <a href="Saluki">Saluki</a>.

In Africa, Azawakh are found in a variety of colors such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black. The Azawakh in its native land also comes with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolor (mostly white). Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">AKC</a> and <a href="United%20Kennel%20Club">UKC</a> allows any color combination found in Africa. In the United States, the FCI standard is modified to have no color restrictions at a minimum and there is a strong sentiment that the FCI standard should be heavily edited or replaced.

Colors permitted by the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Cynologique%20Internationale">FCI</a> breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and <a href="brindle">brindle</a> (with or without a <a href="melanistic%20mask">dark mask</a>), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Currently, white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in France, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked).

The Azawakh's light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright <a href="double%20suspension%20gallop">double suspension gallop</a>.

Azawakhs are an incredibly sound <a href="coursing">coursing</a> hound. Serious coursing injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury.

Azawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> in the breed. <a href="Wobbler%20disease">Wobbler disease</a>, or cervical vertebral instability, does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein Western diet.

Like the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. Litter sizes are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur.

Azawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh.

Unlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with its owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to protect livestock, they do not have innate aggression toward canines or humans unless they are threatened.

Azawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a <a href="Greyhound">Greyhound</a>.

Many Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.

Azawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.

Alberto Rossi: "To raise an Azawakh is like building a very fragile construction, which takes a lot of sensibility and can be destroyed from one minute to the next. But every minute it lasts, it fills you with great happiness." Every time I´m sitting in a chair or sofa at least one of my dogs tries to take a seat on my lap. The same happens to those of my guests which they love. In these moments they seem to be the image of calmness, gentleness, and trust. But one should not be deceived about this. In the deepest place of their soul resides something wild and native, and they will remind us about it with the first occasion and we should not forget, even for a moment, not to treat them like a normal dog."

Bred by the <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg</a>, <a href="Fula%20people">Fula</a> and various other nomads of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, and southern <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, the breed is used there as a <a href="guard%20dog">guard dog</a> and to hunt <a href="gazelle">gazelle</a> and <a href="hare">hare</a> at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed's ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The <a href="Sloughi">Sloughi</a>, by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.

They are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federación Canófila de Puerto Rico (FCPR). European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry. The <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">AKC</a> currently recognizes Azawakh as a <a href="Foundation%20Stock%20Service%20Program">Foundation Stock Service</a> breed and they are eligible to participate in AKC-sanctioned Companion & Performance events. The breed will enter the AKC Miscellaneous Class on June 30, 2011. The American Azawakh Association (AAA). is the AKC Parent Club for the Azawakh. Azawakh may be registered with the <a href="United%20Kennel%20Club">UKC</a> and <a href="American%20Rare%20Breed%20Association">ARBA</a>. The breed is not yet registered by <a href="Canadian%20Kennel%20Club">CKC</a>. Azawakh are eligible for <a href="American%20Sighthound%20Field%20Association">ASFA</a> and <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">AKC</a> lure coursing and <a href="NOFCA">NOFCA</a> open field coursing events.
Genetic, blood protein and archaeological studies, as well as direct observation in the field, offer a glimpse into the origin of the contemporary Azawakh breed. It originated from the <a href="pariah%20dogs">pariah dogs</a> of sub-Saharan Africa—also called "bush dogs" or "basenji"—and is also closely related to the <a href="Sloughi">Sloughi</a> of the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare <a href="glucose%20isomerase">glucose isomerase</a> allele (GPI) that occurs only in <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="jackals">jackals</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20wolf%23Italian%20wolf">Italian wolves</a>, Sloughi dogs and a handful of other quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPI suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations near the base of the dog family tree divergence from wolves or perhaps a uniquely African cross-breeding with local African canids such as jackals. <a href="Petroglyph">Petroglyph</a> rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the <a href="Green%20Sahara">Green Sahara</a> (also known as the Holocene and Neolithic Subpluvial) shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage that has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.

In the <a href="common%20era">common era</a> the Sahel dogs are almost totally isolated from northern dogs by the Sahara, but the ties to the pariah dogs to the south are extremely close. Azawakh are virtually indistinguishable from the Sahel pariah dog population from which they are drawn. In addition to a basic physical structure, the Azawakh share a number of unique traits with the pariah dogs:


Throughout the Sahel, very elegant puppies can be found among rustic siblings. The Sahel nomads do not have the same breed concepts as in the West and, unlike the <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> of the North, do not recognize a strict separation of "al hor" (noble) from "kelb" (mongrel) dogs. The nomads act as an extra level of selection on top of the intense natural selection pressure of the Sahel environment. The approach to selection is diametrically opposed to Western breeding, and presents the advantage of maintaining a large reservoir of genetic variability and resilience.

The peoples of the Sahel control dam lines and cull puppies heavily at birth according to locally held aesthetic criteria that are not yet fully understood. In the Sahel, color is not a selection criterion. The alpha male dog from the local population is usually the sire. Females are usually culled unless the family projects a need for more dogs in the future.

Acrylic paint

Acrylic paint is a fast-drying <a href="paint">paint</a> made of pigment suspended in <a href="acrylic%20resin">acrylic</a> <a href="polymer">polymer</a> <a href="emulsion">emulsion</a>. Acrylic paints are <a href="water-soluble">water-soluble</a>, but become <a href="water-resistant">water-resistant</a> when dry. Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, media, or pastes, the finished acrylic painting can resemble a <a href="watercolor%20painting">watercolor</a> or an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media. Acrylic paint is typically used for crafting, or in art classes in schools because it does not require any chemicals, and rinses away with just water. It also is less likely to leave a stain on clothes than oil paint.

As early as 1934, the first usable acrylic resin dispersion was developed by German chemical company <a href="BASF">BASF</a>, which was patented by <a href="Rohm%20and%20Haas">Rohm and Haas</a>. The synthetic paint was first used in the 1940s, combining some of the properties of oil and watercolor. Between 1946 and 1949, <a href="Leonard%20Bocour">Leonard Bocour</a> and <a href="Sam%20Golden">Sam Golden</a> invented a solution acrylic paint under the brand <a href="Magna%20paint">Magna paint</a>. These were <a href="mineral%20spirits">mineral spirit</a>-based paints. Acrylics were made commercially available in the 1950s.

Following that development, Golden came up with a waterborne acrylic paint called "Aquatec". <a href="Otto%20R%C3%B6hm">Otto Röhm</a> invented <a href="acrylic%20resin">acrylic resin</a>, which was quickly transformed into acrylic paint. In 1953, the year that Rohm and Haas developed the first acrylic emulsions, Jose L. Gutierrez produced "Politec Acrylic Artists' Colors" in Mexico, and Henry Levinson of Cincinnati-based Permanent Pigments Co. produced <a href="Liquitex">Liquitex</a> colors. These two product lines were the very first acrylic emulsion artists' paints.

Water-based acrylic paints were subsequently sold as <a href="latex">latex</a> house paints, as latex is the technical term for a suspension of polymer microparticles in water. Interior latex house paints tend to be a combination of <a href="Binder%20%28material%29">binder</a> (sometimes acrylic, <a href="Vinyl%20group">vinyl</a>, <a href="Polyvinyl%20acetate">pva</a>, and others), <a href="filler%20%28materials%29">filler</a>, <a href="pigment">pigment</a>, and <a href="water">water</a>. Exterior latex house paints may also be a <a href="co-polymer">co-polymer</a> blend, but the best exterior water-based paints are 100% acrylic, due to elasticity and other factors. Vinyl, however, costs half of what 100% acrylic resins cost, and PVA (polyvinyl acetate) is even cheaper, so paint companies make many different combinations of them to match the market.

Soon after the water-based acrylic binders were introduced as house paints, artists and companies alike began to explore the potential of the new binders. Water-soluble artists' acrylic paints were sold commercially by <a href="Liquitex">Liquitex</a> beginning in the 1950s, with modern high-viscosity paints becoming available in the early '60s. In 1963, <a href="George%20Rowney">Rowney</a> (part of <a href="Daler-Rowney">Daler-Rowney</a> since 1983) was the first manufacturer to introduce artist’s acrylic paints in Europe, under the brand name "Cryla".

Before the 19th century, artists mixed their own paints, which allowed them to achieve the desired color and thickness, and to control the use of fillers, if any. While suitable media and raw pigments are available for the individual production of acrylic paint, hand mixing may not be practical because of the fast drying time and other technical issues.

Acrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of the paint surface by using acrylic media or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various media, but the range of acrylic media is much greater. Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and media can be used to modify their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods such as <a href="medium-density%20fibreboard">medium-density fiberboard</a> can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces. In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble watercolors and other water-based media. They can also be used to build thick layers of paint—gel and molding paste media are sometimes used to create paintings with relief features. Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. People who make such models use acrylic paint to build facial features on dolls, or raised details on other types of models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.

Acrylic paints are the most common paints used in <a href="surrealist%20techniques%23Grattage">grattage</a>, a surrealist technique that became popular with the advent of acrylic paint. Acrylics are used for this purpose because they easily scrape or peel from a surface.

Acrylic artists' paints may be thinned with water and used as <a href="Wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">washes</a> in the manner of watercolor paints, but unlike watercolor the washes are not rehydratable once dry. For this reason, acrylics do not lend themselves to the color lifting techniques of <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a>-based watercolor paints.

Acrylic paints with <a href="Gloss%20%28paint%29">gloss or matte</a> finishes are common, although a satin (semi-matte) sheen is most common. Some brands exhibit a range of finishes (e.g. heavy-body paints from <a href="Golden%20Artist%20Colors">Golden</a>, <a href="Liquitex">Liquitex</a>, <a href="Winsor%20%26amp%3B%20Newton">Winsor & Newton</a> and <a href="Daler-Rowney">Daler-Rowney</a>); Politec acrylics are fully matte. As with oils, pigment amounts and particle size or shape can affect the paint sheen. Matting agents can also be added during manufacture to dull the finish. If desired, the artist can mix different media with their paints and use topcoats or varnishes to alter or unify sheen.

When dry, acrylic paint is generally non-removable from a solid surface if it adheres to the surface. Water or mild solvents do not re-solubilize it, although <a href="isopropyl%20alcohol">isopropyl alcohol</a> can lift some fresh paint films off. <a href="Toluene">Toluene</a> and <a href="acetone">acetone</a> can remove paint films, but they do not lift paint stains very well and are not selective. The use of a solvent to remove paint may result in removal of all of the paint layers (acrylic <a href="gesso">gesso</a>, et cetera). Oils and warm, soapy water can remove acrylic paint from skin.

Only a proper acrylic gesso should be used to prime canvas in preparation for painting with acrylic paints. However, acrylic paint can be applied to a raw canvas if so desired without any negative effect or chemical reaction (the case with oil paint). It is important to avoid adding non-stable or non-archival elements to the gesso upon application. However, the viscosity of acrylic can be successfully reduced by using suitable extenders that maintain the integrity of the paint film. There are <a href="Acrylic%20retarder">retarders</a> to slow drying and extend "workability" time, and "flow releases" to increase color-blending ability.

Commercial acrylic paints come in two grades:


The vehicle and binder of <a href="oil%20paint">oil paint</a>s is <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a> (or another <a href="drying%20oil">drying oil</a>), whereas acrylic paint has water as the vehicle for an <a href="emulsion">emulsion</a> (suspension) of acrylic polymer, which serves as the binder. Thus, oil paint is said to be "oil-based", whereas acrylic paint is "water-based" (or sometimes "water-borne").
The main practical difference between most acrylics and oil paints is the inherent drying time. Oils allow for more time to blend colors and apply even glazes over <a href="underpainting">underpainting</a>s. This slow-drying aspect of oil can be seen as an advantage for certain techniques, but it impedes an artist trying to work quickly. The fast evaporation of water from regular acrylic paint films can be slowed with the use of <a href="acrylic%20retarder">acrylic retarder</a>s. Retarders are generally glycol or glycerin-based additives. The addition of a retarder slows the evaporation rate of the water.

Oil paints may require the use of solvents such as mineral spirits or <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible oil paints have been developed for artists' use. Oil paint films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of "<a href="fat%20over%20lean">fat over lean</a>" must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.

Oil paint has a higher pigment load than acrylic paint. As linseed oil contains a smaller molecule than acrylic paint, oil paint is able to absorb substantially more pigment. Oil provides a refractive index that is less clear than acrylic dispersions, which imparts a unique "look and feel" to the resultant paint film. Not all the pigments of oil paints are available in acrylics.

Due to acrylic paint's more flexible nature and more consistent drying time between layers, an artist does not have to follow the same rules of oil painting, where more medium must be applied to each layer to avoid cracking. It usually takes 15–20 minutes for one to two layers of acrylic paint to dry. Although canvas needs to be properly primed before painting with oil to prevent it from eventually rotting the canvas, acrylic can be safely applied straight to the canvas. The rapid drying of acrylic paint tends to discourage blending of color and use of <a href="wet-in-wet">wet-in-wet</a> technique as in oil painting. Even though acrylic retarders can slow drying time to several hours, it remains a relatively fast-drying medium and adding too much acrylic retarder can prevent the paint from ever drying properly.

Meanwhile, acrylic paint is very elastic, which prevents cracking from occurring. Acrylic paint's binder is acrylic polymer emulsion – as this binder dries, the paint remains flexible.

Another difference between oil and acrylic paints is the versatility offered by acrylic paints. Acrylics are very useful in mixed media, allowing the use of pastel (oil & chalk), charcoal and pen (among others) on top of the dried acrylic painted surface. Mixing other bodies into the acrylic is possible—sand, rice, and even pasta may be incorporated in the artwork. Mixing artist or student grade acrylic paint with household acrylic emulsions is possible, allowing the use of premixed tints straight from the tube or tin, and thereby presenting the painter with a vast color range at their disposal. This versatility is also illustrated by the variety of additional artistic uses for acrylics. Specialized acrylics have been manufactured and used for <a href="Linoblock">linoblock printing</a> (acrylic <a href="block%20printing">block printing</a> ink has been produced by Derivan since the early 1980s), <a href="Face%20Painting">face painting</a>, <a href="airbrushing">airbrushing</a>, <a href="Watercolor%20painting">watercolor</a>-like techniques, and <a href="Screen%20printing">fabric screen printing</a>.

Another difference between oil and acrylic paint is the cleanup. Acrylic paint can be cleaned out of a brush with any soap, while oil paint needs a specific type to be sure to get all the oil out of the brushes. Also, it is easier to let a palette with oil paint dry and then scrape the paint off, whereas one can easily clean wet acrylic paint with water.

Angular momentum

In <a href="physics">physics</a>, angular momentum (rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational analog of <a href="linear%20momentum">linear momentum</a>. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a <a href="Conservation%20law">conserved quantity</a> – the angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external <a href="torque">torque</a>.

The definition of angular momentum for a <a href="point%20particle">point particle</a> is a <a href="pseudovector">pseudovector</a> r×p, the <a href="cross%20product">cross product</a> of the particle's <a href="position%20vector">position vector</a> r (relative to some origin) and its <a href="momentum%20vector">momentum vector</a> p = "m"v. This definition can be applied to each point in <a href="Continuum%20mechanics">continua</a> like solids or fluids, or <a href="field%20%28physics%29">physical fields</a>. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it. The angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a> ω of the object (how fast it rotates about an axis) via the <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> "I" (which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation). However, while ω always points in the direction of the rotation axis, the angular momentum L may point in a "different" direction depending on how the mass is distributed.

Angular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of a system is the (pseudo)<a href="vector%20sum">vector sum</a> of the angular momenta. For continua or fields one uses <a href="Integral">integration</a>. The total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components: "orbital" angular momentum about an axis outside the object, plus "spin" angular momentum through the <a href="centre%20of%20mass">centre of mass</a> of the object.

Torque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to <a href="force">force</a>. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning <a href="figure%20skater">figure skater</a> as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s, the <a href="falling%20cat%20problem">falling cat problem</a>, and <a href="precession">precession</a> of <a href="Spinning%20top">tops</a> and gyros. Applications include the <a href="gyrocompass">gyrocompass</a>, <a href="control%20moment%20gyroscope">control moment gyroscope</a>, <a href="Inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial guidance systems</a>, <a href="reaction%20wheel">reaction wheel</a>s, <a href="Flying%20disc">flying discs or Frisbees</a> and <a href="Earth%27s%20rotation">Earth's rotation</a> to name a few. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">angular momentum is an operator</a> with quantized eigenvalues. Angular momentum is subject to the <a href="Heisenberg%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a>, meaning that only one component can be measured with definite precision, the other two cannot. Also, the "<a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>" of <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s does not correspond to literal spinning motion.

Angular momentum is a <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a> quantity (more precisely, a <a href="pseudovector">pseudovector</a>) that represents the product of a body's <a href="Moment%20of%20inertia">rotational inertia</a> and <a href="Angular%20velocity">rotational velocity</a> about a particular axis. In the simple case of revolution of a <a href="particle">particle</a> in a <a href="circle">circle</a> about a center of rotation, the particle remaining always in the same <a href="Plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a> and having always the same distance from the center, it is sufficient to discard the <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a> nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a <a href="scalar%20%28mathematics%29">scalar</a>. Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of <a href="momentum">linear momentum</a>. Thus, where linear momentum formula_1 is proportional to <a href="mass">mass</a> formula_2 and <a href="speed">linear speed</a> formula_3,

angular momentum formula_5 is proportional to <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> formula_6 and <a href="Angular%20frequency">angular speed</a> formula_7,

Unlike mass, which depends only on amount of matter, moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter. Unlike linear speed, which occurs in a straight line, angular speed occurs about a center of rotation. Therefore, strictly speaking, formula_5 should be referred to as the angular momentum "relative to that center".

Because formula_10 for a single particle and formula_11 for circular motion, angular momentum can be expanded, formula_12 and reduced to,

the product of the <a href="radius">radius</a> of rotation formula_14 and the <a href="linear%20momentum">linear momentum</a> of the particle formula_15, where formula_3 in this case is the equivalent <a href="speed">linear (tangential) speed</a> at the radius (formula_17).

This simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the <a href="Position%20%28vector%29">radius vector</a> is considered. In that case,

where formula_19 is the perpendicular component of the motion. Expanding, formula_20 rearranging, formula_21 and reducing, angular momentum can also be expressed,

where formula_23 is the length of the <a href="torque%23Moment%20arm%20formula">"moment arm"</a>, a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle. It is this definition, to which the term "moment of momentum" refers.

Another approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum of the angular coordinate formula_24 expressed in the <a href="Lagrangian%20mechanics">Lagrangian</a> of the mechanical system. Consider a mechanical system with a mass formula_2 constrained to move in a circle of radius formula_26 in the absence of any external force field. The kinetic energy of the system is

And the potential energy is

Then the Lagrangian is

The "generalized momentum" "canonically conjugate to" the coordinate formula_24 is defined by

To completely define angular momentum in <a href="Three-dimensional%20space">three dimensions</a>, it is required to know the <a href="Angular%20velocity">angle swept out in unit time</a>, the direction of the axis of rotation, and the sense (right- or left-handed) of the rotation, as well as the <a href="mass">mass</a> involved. By retaining this <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a> nature of angular momentum, the general nature of the equations is also retained, and can describe any sort of three-dimensional <a href="Motion%20%28physics%29">motion</a> about the center of rotation – <a href="Circular%20motion">circular</a>, <a href="Linear%20motion">linear</a>, or otherwise. In <a href="vector%20notation">vector notation</a>, the angular momentum of a <a href="Point%20particle">particle</a> in motion about the <a href="Origin%20%28mathematics%29">origin of coordinates</a> is defined as:

This can be expanded, formula_39 reduced, formula_40
and by the rules of <a href="Vector%20calculus">vector algebra</a> rearranged to the form,
which is the <a href="cross%20product">cross product</a> of the position vector formula_35 and the linear momentum formula_43 of the particle. By the definition of the cross product, the formula_44 vector is <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to both formula_35 and formula_46. It is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the <a href="right-hand%20rule">right-hand rule</a> – so that the rotation is seen as <a href="clockwise">counter-clockwise</a> from the head of the vector. Conversely, the formula_44 vector defines the <a href="Plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a> in which formula_35 and formula_46 lie.

By defining a <a href="unit%20vector">unit vector</a> formula_50 in the direction of the axis of rotation, a <a href="angular%20frequency">scalar angular speed</a> formula_7 results, where
The two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given direction:
and formula_56 for circular motion, where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius formula_14.

Angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of <a href="linear%20momentum">linear momentum</a>. Like linear momentum it involves elements of <a href="mass">mass</a> and <a href="Displacement%20%28vector%29">displacement</a>. Unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of <a href="Position%20%28vector%29">position</a> and <a href="shape">shape</a>.

Many problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space, be it in actual rotation about it, or simply moving past it, where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point — can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it? <a href="Energy">Energy</a>, the ability to do <a href="Work%20%28physics%29">work</a>, can be stored in matter by setting it in motion — a combination of its <a href="inertia">inertia</a> and its displacement. Inertia is measured by its <a href="mass">mass</a>, and displacement by its <a href="velocity">velocity</a>. Their product,

is the matter's <a href="momentum">momentum</a>. Referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication: the momentum is not applied to the point directly. For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a <a href="lever">lever</a> of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the "moment arm". It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a <a href="Moment%20%28physics%29">"moment".</a> Hence, the particle's momentum referred to a particular point,

is the "angular momentum", sometimes called, as here, the "moment of momentum" of the particle versus that particular center point. The equation formula_60 combines a moment (a mass formula_2 turning moment arm formula_14) with a linear (straight-line equivalent) speed formula_3. Linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance formula_14 and the angular speed formula_7 versus the point: formula_66 another moment. Hence, angular momentum contains a double moment: formula_67 Simplifying slightly, formula_68 the quantity formula_69 is the particle's <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a>, sometimes called the second moment of mass. It is a measure of rotational inertia.

Because rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum, it necessarily includes all of the complications of <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a>, which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the <a href="Square%20%28algebra%29">squares</a> of their <a href="distances">distances</a> from the center of rotation. Therefore, the total moment of inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration of the <a href="matter">matter</a> about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits.

For a <a href="rigid%20body">rigid body</a>, for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the <a href="Rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis">rotation axis</a> versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a>, or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place. It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.

For a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.

In brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the <a href="Torque%23Moment%20arm%20formula">moment arm</a>), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>. In many cases the <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a>, and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,
Similarly, for a <a href="Point%20particle">point mass</a> formula_2 the <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> is defined as,
and for any collection of particles formula_76 as the sum,

Angular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its <a href="Units%20of%20measurement">units</a> versus linear momentum: <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">kg·m/s</a>, <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">N·m·s</a> or <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">J·s</a> for angular momentum versus <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">kg·m/s</a> or <a href="SI%20derived%20unit">N·s</a> for linear momentum. Angular momentum's units can be interpreted as <a href="torque">torque</a>·seconds, <a href="Work%20%28physics%29">work</a>·seconds, or <a href="energy">energy</a>·seconds. An object with angular momentum of can be reduced to zero rotation (all of the energy can be transferred out of it) by an angular <a href="Impulse%20%28physics%29">impulse</a> of or equivalently, by torque or work of for one second, or energy of for one second.

The <a href="Plane%20%28geometry%29">plane</a> <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass is sometimes called the "invariable plane", because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered. One such plane is the <a href="Invariable%20plane">invariable plane of the Solar System</a>.

<a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion%23Newton%27s%20second%20law">Newton's Second Law of Motion</a> can be expressed mathematically,
or <a href="force">force</a> = <a href="mass">mass</a> × <a href="acceleration">acceleration</a>. The rotational equivalent is
or <a href="torque">torque</a> = <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> × <a href="angular%20acceleration">angular acceleration</a>. Because angular acceleration is the time <a href="derivative">derivative</a> of <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>, this is equivalent to formula_80 Rearranging into a form suitable for <a href="Integral">integration</a>, formula_81 and formula_82 and integrating with respect to time,
Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, known as "angular impulse", by analogy with <a href="Impulse%20%28physics%29">impulse</a>, which is defined as the change in <a href="momentum">translational momentum</a>. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque formula_84 then angular momentum formula_85 That is, if no torque acts upon a body, then its angular momentum remains constant. Conversely,
or Angular momentum = <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> × <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>, and its time <a href="derivative">derivative</a> is

Because moment of inertia is constant, formula_88 is zero, and formula_89 which, as above, reduces to

Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied <a href="torque">torque</a> about that center. If angular momentum is constant, formula_91 and no torque is applied.

A rotational analog of <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion%23Newton%27s%20third%20law">Newton's Third Law of Motion</a> might be written, "In a <a href="closed%20system">closed system</a>, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque." Hence, "angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved)."

Similarly, a rotational analogy of <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion%23Newton%27s%20second%20law">Newton's Second law of Motion</a> might be, "A change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque." Since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, then if torque is zero, angular momentum is constant. As above, a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system. Therefore, "requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence, in the form of a torque, acts upon it."

A rotational analog of <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion%23Newton%27s%20first%20law">Newton's First Law of Motion</a> might be written, "A body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless acted by an external torque." Thus "with no external influence to act upon it, the original angular momentum of the system is conserved".

The conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing <a href="Classical%20central-force%20problem">"central force motion"</a>. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the "center", then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the <a href="Position%20%28vector%29">radius vector</a>, and none is <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the radius. Mathematically, torque formula_92 because in this case formula_35 and formula_94 are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with <a href="gravity">gravitational attraction</a> in the <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s of <a href="planet">planet</a>s and <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the <a href="atom">atom</a>.

For a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the <a href="Lunar%20theory">Earth–Moon system</a> results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to <a href="Tidal%20acceleration">tidal torque</a> the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day, and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit, at about 3.82 centimeters per year.

The conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an <a href="Ice%20skating">ice skater</a> as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> and <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.

The same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s, <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object "n" times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of "n".

Conservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning <a href="top">top</a> is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the <a href="nutation">nutation</a> axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its <a href="precession">precession</a> axis. Also, in any <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.

<a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> states that every <a href="conservation%20law">conservation law</a> is associated with a <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> (invariant) of the underlying physics. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is <a href="rotational%20invariance">rotational invariance</a>. The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.

In astrodynamics and <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>, a "massless" (or "per unit mass") angular momentum is defined
called "<a href="Specific%20relative%20angular%20momentum">specific angular momentum</a>". Note that formula_96 <a href="Mass">Mass</a> is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations, because motion is defined by <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.

For a continuous mass distribution with <a href="density">density</a> function "ρ"(r), a differential <a href="volume%20element">volume element</a> "dV" with <a href="position%20vector">position vector</a> r within the mass has a mass element "dm" = "ρ"(r)"dV". Therefore, the <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a> angular momentum of this element is:

and <a href="volume%20integral">integrating</a> this <a href="differential%20%28infinitesimal%29">differential</a> over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:

In the derivation which follows, integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass.

For a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin, it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin. Given,

The total mass of the particles is simply their sum,

The position vector of the center of mass is defined by,

By inspection,

The total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle,
Expanding formula_101,

Expanding formula_103,

It can be shown that (see sidebar),
therefore the second and third terms vanish,

The first term can be rearranged,
and total angular momentum for the collection of particles is finally,
The first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin. Similar to <a href="Angular%20momentum%23Single%20particle">Single particle</a>, below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass "M" at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to <a href="Angular%20momentum%23Fixed%20center%20of%20mass">Fixed center of mass</a>, below. The result is general — the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.

Rearranging equation () by vector identities, multiplying both terms by "one", and grouping appropriately,

gives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of <a href="moment%20of%20inertia">moment of inertia</a> formula_6 and <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a> formula_125,

In the case of a single particle moving about the arbitrary origin,

For the case of the center of mass fixed in space with respect to the origin,

In modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see <a href="%23Angular%20momentum%20in%20quantum%20mechanics">below</a>) is described using a different formalism, instead of a classical <a href="pseudovector">pseudovector</a>. In this formalism, angular momentum is the <a href="2-form">2-form</a> <a href="Noether%20charge">Noether charge</a> associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general <a href="curved%20space">curved space</a>times, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.

In classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:

in which the <a href="exterior%20product">exterior product</a> ∧ replaces the <a href="cross%20product">cross product</a> × (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the x and p vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher). In Cartesian coordinates:

or more compactly in index notation:

The angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor, with components "ω". The relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensor:

Again, this equation in L and ω as tensors is true in any number of dimensions. This equation also appears in the <a href="geometric%20algebra">geometric algebra</a> formalism, in which L and ω are bivectors, and the moment of inertia is a mapping between them.

In <a href="relativistic%20mechanics">relativistic mechanics</a>, the <a href="relativistic%20angular%20momentum">relativistic angular momentum</a> of a particle is expressed as an <a href="antisymmetric%20tensor">antisymmetric tensor</a> of second order:

in the language of <a href="four-vector">four-vector</a>s, namely the <a href="Four-position">four position</a> "X" and the <a href="four%20momentum">four momentum</a> "P", and absorbs the above L together with the motion of the <a href="centre%20of%20mass">centre of mass</a> of the particle.

In each of the above cases, for a system of particles, the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and the centre of mass is for the system.

Angular momentum in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. In <a href="relativistic%20quantum%20mechanics%23Relativistic%20quantum%20angular%20momentum">relativistic quantum mechanics</a>, it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator.

The classical definition of angular momentum as formula_142 can be carried over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting r as the quantum <a href="position%20operator">position operator</a> and p as the quantum <a href="momentum%20operator">momentum operator</a>. L is then an <a href="Operator%20%28physics%29">operator</a>, specifically called the "<a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">orbital angular momentum operator</a>". The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3) of the rotation group SO(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space. (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)

However, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called "<a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin angular momentum</a>", represented by the spin operator S. Almost all <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s have a characteristic spin, for example <a href="electron">electron</a>s have "spin 1/2" (this actually means "spin <a href="reduced%20Planck%20constant">ħ</a>/2") while <a href="photon">photon</a>s have "spin 1" (this actually means "spin ħ").

Finally, there is <a href="total%20angular%20momentum">total angular momentum</a> J, which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, J = L + S.) <a href="Conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum">Conservation of angular momentum</a> applies to J, but not to L or S; for example, the <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a> allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between L and S, with the total remaining constant. Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.

In <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, angular momentum is <a href="angular%20momentum%20quantization">quantized</a> – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in "<a href="Quantum%20number">quantum leaps</a>" between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where formula_143 is the <a href="reduced%20Planck%20constant">reduced Planck constant</a> and formula_144 is any <a href="direction%20vector">direction vector</a> such as x, y, or z:

The <a href="reduced%20Planck%20constant">reduced Planck constant</a> formula_143 is tiny by everyday standards, about 10 <a href="Joule-second">J s</a>, and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>s and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.

Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> in his <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom and was later predicted by <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> in his <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation%23Quantization">Schrödinger equation</a>.

In the definition formula_142, six operators are involved: The <a href="position%20operator">position operator</a>s formula_147, formula_148, formula_149, and the <a href="momentum%20operator">momentum operator</a>s formula_150, formula_151, formula_152. However, the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a> tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's <a href="magnitude%20%28vector%29">magnitude</a> and its component along one axis.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">angular momentum operator</a> do not <a href="commutator">commute</a>, for example formula_153. (For the precise <a href="commutation%20relation">commutation relation</a>s, see <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">angular momentum operator</a>.)

As mentioned above, orbital angular momentum L is defined as in classical mechanics: formula_142, but "total" angular momentum J is defined in a different, more basic way: J is defined as the "generator of rotations". More specifically, J is defined so that the operator
is the <a href="Rotation%20operator%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">rotation operator</a> that takes any system and rotates it by angle formula_24 about the axis formula_157. (The "exp" in the formula refers to <a href="matrix%20exponential">operator exponential</a>) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the <a href="rotation%20group%20SO%283%29">rotation group SO(3)</a> will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.

The relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>s and <a href="Lie%20group">Lie group</a>s in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.

When describing the motion of a <a href="charged%20particle">charged particle</a> in an <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a>, the <a href="canonical%20momentum">canonical momentum</a> P (derived from the <a href="Lagrangian%20mechanics">Lagrangian</a> for this system) is not <a href="gauge%20invariant">gauge invariant</a>. As a consequence, the canonical angular momentum L = r × P is not gauge invariant either. Instead, the momentum that is physical, the so-called "kinetic momentum" (used throughout this article), is (in <a href="SI%20units">SI units</a>)

where "e" is the <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> of the particle and A the <a href="magnetic%20vector%20potential">magnetic vector potential</a> of the electromagnetic field. The <a href="Gauge%20theory">gauge-invariant</a> angular momentum, that is "kinetic angular momentum", is given by

The interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on <a href="canonical%20commutation%20relation">canonical commutation relation</a>s.

In "classical Maxwell electrodynamics" the <a href="Poynting%20vector">Poynting vector</a>
is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic field.

The angular momentum density vector formula_161 is given by a vector product
as in classical mechanics:

The above identities are valid " locally ", i.e. in each space point formula_163 in a given moment formula_164.

<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a>, in the <a href="Philosophiae%20Naturalis%20Principia%20Mathematica">"Principia"</a>, hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the <a href="Newton%27s%20laws%20of%20motion">First Law of Motion</a>,

He did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the "Principia",
However, his geometric proof of the <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion%23Second%20law">Law of Areas</a> is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a <a href="central%20force">central force</a>.

As a <a href="planet">planet</a> orbits the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Kepler</a> expounded his <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion">Second Law of Planetary Motion</a>. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's <a href="gravity">gravity</a> was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.

During the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point A to point B. Undisturbed, it would continue to point c during the second interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward point S. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the <a href="Parallelogram%20of%20force">rules of velocity composition</a>, these two velocities add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle SAB, therefore the object has swept out equal areas SAB and SBC in equal times.

At point C, the object receives another impulse toward S, again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to D. Thus it continues to E and beyond, the triangles SAB, SBc, SBC, SCd, SCD, SDe, SDE all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path ABCDE approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.

Note that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's Second Law of Planetary Motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.

The proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the <a href="Angular%20momentum%23Scalar%20%E2%80%93%20angular%20momentum%20in%20two%20dimensions">radius</a>, and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of <a href="Angular%20momentum%23Scalar%20%E2%80%93%20angular%20momentum%20in%20two%20dimensions">velocity</a>. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula , the product and therefore the product are constant: if and the base length are decreased, and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore <a href="Angular%20momentum%23Scalar%20%E2%80%93%20angular%20momentum%20in%20two%20dimensions">angular momentum</a> is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.

In the case of triangle SBC, area is equal to (SB)(VC). Wherever C is eventually located due to the impulse applied at B, the product (SB)(VC), and therefore remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.

<a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a>, and <a href="Patrick%20d%27Arcy">Patrick d'Arcy</a> all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of <a href="areal%20velocity">areal velocity</a>, a result of their analysis of <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion%23Second%20law">Kepler's Second Law</a> of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.

In 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his "<a href="Mechanica">Mechanica</a>" without further developing them.

Bernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a "moment of rotational motion", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.

In 1799, <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation — his "<a href="invariable%20plane">invariable plane</a>".

<a href="Louis%20Poinsot">Louis Poinsot</a> in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the "conservation of moments".

In 1852 <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Foucault">Léon Foucault</a> used a <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a> in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.

<a href="William%20John%20Macquorn%20Rankine">William J. M. Rankine's</a> 1858 "Manual of Applied Mechanics" defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:

In an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that "The term "angular momentum" was introduced by Mr. Hayward," probably referring to R.B. Hayward's article "On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities, Accelerations, and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in any manner in Space with Applications," which was introduced in 1856, and published in 1864. Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries. However, Hayward's article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the English-speaking world. Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as "momentum of rotation" in English.

Plum pudding model

The plum pudding model is one of several <a href="Scientific%20modelling">scientific models</a> of the <a href="atom">atom</a>. First proposed by <a href="J.%20J.%20Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a> in 1904 soon after the discovery of the <a href="electron">electron</a>, but before the discovery of the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>, the model represented an attempt to consolidate the known properties of atoms at the time: 1) electrons are negatively-charged particles and 2) atoms are neutrally-charged.

In this model, atoms were known to consist of negatively charged electrons. Though Thomson called them "corpuscles", they were more commonly called "electrons" as <a href="G.%20J.%20Stoney">G. J. Stoney</a> proposed in 1894. At the time, atoms were known to be neutrally charged. To account for this, Thomson knew atoms must also have a source of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons. He considered three plausible models that would satisfy the known properties of atoms at the time:


Thomson chose the third possibility as the most likely structure of atoms. Thomson published his proposed model in the March 1904 edition of the "<a href="Philosophical%20Magazine">Philosophical Magazine</a>", the leading British science journal of the day. In Thomson's view:
... the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification, ...

With this model, Thomson abandoned his earlier "nebular atom" hypothesis in which atoms were composed of immaterial vortices. Being an astute and practical scientist, Thomson based his atomic model on known experimental evidence of the day. His proposal of a positive volume charge reflects the nature of his scientific approach to discovery which was to propose ideas to guide future experiments.

The orbits of electrons within the model were stabilized by the fact that when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively-charged sphere, it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force, because there was more positive charge inside its orbit (see <a href="Gauss%27s%20law">Gauss's law</a>). Electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions among the electrons, and spectroscopic measurements were meant to account for energy differences associated with different electron rings. Thomson attempted unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major spectral lines experimentally known for several elements.

The plum pudding model usefully guided his student, <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, to devise experiments to further explore the composition of atoms. As well, Thomson's model (along with a similar <a href="Saturnian%20model">Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons</a> put forward in 1904 by <a href="Hantaro%20Nagaoka">Nagaoka</a> after <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>'s <a href="Rings%20of%20Saturn%23History">model of Saturn's rings</a>), were useful predecessors of the more correct solar-system-like <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom.

The colloquial nickname "plum pudding" was soon attributed to Thomson's model as the distribution of electrons within its positively-charged region of space reminded many scientists of "<a href="plum">plum</a>s" in the common English dessert, <a href="plum%20pudding">plum pudding</a>.

In 1909, <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Marsden">Ernest Marsden</a> conducted experiments with <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden%20experiment">thin sheets of gold</a>. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected to find results consistent with Thomson's atomic model. It wasn't until 1911 that Rutherford correctly interpreted the experiment's results which implied the presence of a very small nucleus of positive charge at the center of gold atoms. This led to the development of the <a href="Rutherford%20model">Rutherford model</a> of the atom. Immediately after Rutherford published his results, <a href="Antonius%20Van%20den%20Broek">Antonius Van den Broek</a> made the intuitive proposal that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus. <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a>'s 1913 experiments (see <a href="Moseley%27s%20law">Moseley's law</a>) provided the necessary evidence to support Van den Broek's proposal. The effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number (Moseley found only one unit of charge difference). This work culminated in the solar-system-like (but quantum-limited) <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom in the same year, in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells. As Thomson's model guided Rutherford's experiments, Bohr's model guided Moseley's research.

The plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist <a href="Arthur%20Erich%20Haas">Arthur Erich Haas</a> in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of <a href="Planck%27s%20constant">Planck's constant</a> and the <a href="Bohr%20radius">Bohr radius</a> of hydrogen atoms. Haas' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> by three years. Of note, the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> itself only provides substantially-reasonable predictions for <a href="atom">atom</a>ic and <a href="ion">ion</a>ic systems having a single effective electron.

A particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere called the <a href="Thomson%20problem">Thomson problem</a>. The Thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.

The classical electrostatic treatment of electrons confined to spherical <a href="quantum%20dot">quantum dot</a>s is also similar to their treatment in the plum pudding model. In this classical problem, the quantum dot is modeled as a simple dielectric sphere (in place of a uniform, positively-charged sphere as in the plum pudding model) in which free, or excess, electrons reside. The electrostatic N-electron configurations are found to be exceptionally close to solutions found in the Thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere. Notably, the plotted distribution of geometry-dependent energetics has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbitals in natural atoms as arranged on the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of elements. Of great interest, solutions of the Thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each N-electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring (N-1)-electron solution with one charge at the origin. However, when treated within a dielectric sphere model, the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity with respect to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms.

Atomic theory

In <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a>, atomic theory is a <a href="scientific%20theory">scientific theory</a> of the nature of <a href="matter">matter</a>, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called <a href="atom">atom</a>s. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave as if it were made up of atoms.

The word "atom" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a> adjective "atomos", meaning "indivisible". 19th century chemists began using the term in connection with the growing number of irreducible chemical elements. While seemingly apropos, around the turn of the 20th century, through various experiments with <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> and <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>, physicists discovered that the so-called "uncuttable atom" was actually a conglomerate of various <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s (chiefly, <a href="electron">electron</a>s, <a href="proton">proton</a>s and <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s) which can exist separately from each other. In fact, in certain extreme environments, such as <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s, extreme temperature and pressure prevents atoms from existing at all. 

Since atoms were found to be divisible, physicists later invented the term "<a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s" to describe the "uncuttable", though not indestructible, parts of an atom. The field of science which studies subatomic particles is <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>, and it is in this field that physicists hope to discover the true fundamental nature of matter.

The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old one, appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India. However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms.

Near the end of the 18th century, two laws about chemical reactions emerged without referring to the notion of an atomic theory. The first was the <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">law of conservation of mass</a>, formulated by <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> in 1789, which states that the total mass in a chemical reaction remains constant (that is, the reactants have the same mass as the products). The second was the <a href="law%20of%20definite%20proportions">law of definite proportions</a>. First proven by the French chemist <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Proust">Joseph Louis Proust</a> in 1799, this law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, then the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance.

<a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a> studied and expanded upon this previous work and developed the <a href="law%20of%20multiple%20proportions">law of multiple proportions</a>: if two elements can be combined to form a number of possible compounds, then the ratios of the masses of the second element which combine with a fixed mass of the first element will be ratios of small whole numbers. For example: Proust had studied <a href="tin%20oxide%20%28disambiguation%29">tin oxide</a>s and found that their masses were either 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen or 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (these were <a href="tin%28II%29%20oxide">tin(II) oxide</a> and <a href="tin%20dioxide">tin dioxide</a> respectively). Dalton noted from these percentages that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen; 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2. Dalton found that an atomic theory of matter could elegantly explain this common pattern in chemistry. In the case of Proust's tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.

Dalton believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbed different gases in different proportions - for example, he found that water absorbed <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> far better than it absorbed <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences in mass and complexity of the gases' respective particles. Indeed, carbon dioxide molecules (CO) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N).

Dalton proposed that each chemical element is composed of atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (<a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>s). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.
In 1803 Dalton orally presented his first list of relative atomic weights for a number of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there exactly how he obtained these figures. The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance <a href="Thomas%20Thomson%20%28chemist%29">Thomas Thomson</a>, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, "A System of Chemistry". Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, "A New System of Chemical Philosophy", 1808 and 1810.

Dalton estimated the atomic weights according to the mass ratios in which they combined, with the hydrogen atom taken as unity. However, Dalton did not conceive that with some elements atoms exist in molecules—e.g. pure oxygen exists as O. He also mistakenly believed that the simplest compound between any two elements is always one atom of each (so he thought water was HO, not HO). This, in addition to the crudity of his equipment, flawed his results. For instance, in 1803 he believed that oxygen atoms were 5.5 times heavier than hydrogen atoms, because in water he measured 5.5 grams of oxygen for every 1 gram of hydrogen and believed the formula for water was HO. Adopting better data, in 1806 he concluded that the atomic weight of oxygen must actually be 7 rather than 5.5, and he retained this weight for the rest of his life. Others at this time had already concluded that the oxygen atom must weigh 8 relative to hydrogen equals 1, if one assumes Dalton's formula for the water molecule (HO), or 16 if one assumes the modern water formula (HO).

The flaw in Dalton's theory was corrected in principle in 1811 by <a href="Amedeo%20Avogadro">Amedeo Avogadro</a>. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain equal numbers of molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles does not affect the volume that it occupies). <a href="Avogadro%27s%20law">Avogadro's law</a> allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made a clear distinction between molecules and atoms.

In 1827, the British botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> observed that dust particles inside pollen grains floating in water constantly jiggled about for no apparent reason. In 1905, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> theorized that this <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a> was caused by the water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist <a href="Jean%20Perrin">Jean Perrin</a>, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).

Atoms were thought to be the smallest possible division of matter until 1897 when <a href="J.J.%20Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a> discovered the <a href="electron">electron</a> through his work on <a href="cathode%20ray">cathode ray</a>s.

A <a href="Crookes%20tube">Crookes tube</a> is a sealed glass container in which two <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s are separated by a vacuum. When a <a href="voltage">voltage</a> is applied across the electrodes, cathode rays are generated, creating a glowing patch where they strike the glass at the opposite end of the tube. Through experimentation, Thomson discovered that the rays could be deflected by an <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a> (in addition to <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s, which was already known). He concluded that these rays, rather than being a form of light, were composed of very light <a href="electric%20charge">negatively charged</a> particles he called "corpuscles" (they would later be renamed electrons by other scientists). He measured the mass-to-charge ratio and discovered it was 1800 times smaller than that of hydrogen, the smallest atom. These corpuscles were a particle unlike any other previously known.

Thomson suggested that atoms were divisible, and that the corpuscles were their building blocks. To explain the overall neutral charge of the atom, he proposed that the corpuscles were distributed in a uniform sea of positive charge; this was the <a href="plum%20pudding%20model">plum pudding model</a> as the electrons were embedded in the positive charge like plums in a plum pudding (although in Thomson's model they were not stationary).

Thomson's <a href="plum%20pudding%20model">plum pudding model</a> was disproved in 1909 by one of his former students, <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, who discovered that most of the mass and positive charge of an atom is concentrated in a very small fraction of its volume, which he assumed to be at the very center.

In the <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93Marsden%20experiment">Geiger–Marsden experiment</a>, <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Marsden">Ernest Marsden</a> (colleagues of Rutherford working at his behest) shot <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s at thin sheets of metal and measured their deflection through the use of a <a href="fluorescence">fluorescent screen</a>. Given the very small mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.

This led Rutherford to propose a <a href="Rutherford%20model">planetary model</a> in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact nucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong enough to cause the heavy deflection.

The planetary model of the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a> is known to emit <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a>s according to the <a href="Larmor%20formula">Larmor formula</a> in <a href="classical%20electromagnetism">classical electromagnetism</a>. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in a small fraction of a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked <a href="Emission%20spectrum">emission</a> and <a href="Absorption%20spectrum">absorption spectra</a> of atoms that were observed.
<a href="Quantum%20mechanics">Quantum theory</a> revolutionized physics at the beginning of the 20th century, when <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> postulated that light energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts known as <a href="Quantum">quanta</a> (singular, "quantum"). In 1913, <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> incorporated this idea into his <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom, in which an electron could only orbit the nucleus in particular circular orbits with fixed <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> and energy, its distance from the nucleus (i.e., their radii) being proportional to its energy. Under this model an electron could not spiral into the nucleus because it could not lose energy in a continuous manner; instead, it could only make instantaneous "<a href="Atomic%20electron%20transition">quantum leap</a>s" between the fixed <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s. When this occurred, light was emitted or absorbed at a frequency proportional to the change in energy (hence the absorption and emission of light in discrete spectra).

Bohr's model was not perfect. It could only predict the <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s of hydrogen; it couldn't predict those of multielectron atoms. Worse still, as <a href="Spectrophotometry">spectrographic technology</a> improved, additional spectral lines in hydrogen were observed which Bohr's model couldn't explain. In 1916, <a href="Arnold%20Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> added elliptical orbits to the Bohr model to explain the extra emission lines, but this made the model very difficult to use, and it still couldn't explain more complex atoms.

While experimenting with the products of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>, in 1913 <a href="radiochemistry">radiochemist</a> <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> discovered that there appeared to be more than one element at each position on the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. The term <a href="isotope">isotope</a> was coined by <a href="Margaret%20Todd%20%28doctor%29">Margaret Todd</a> as a suitable name for these elements.

That same year, <a href="J.J.%20Thomson">J.J. Thomson</a> conducted an experiment in which he channeled a stream of <a href="neon">neon</a> <a href="ion">ion</a>s through magnetic and electric fields, striking a photographic plate at the other end. He observed two glowing patches on the plate, which suggested two different deflection trajectories. Thomson concluded this was because some of the neon ions had a different mass. The nature of this differing mass would later be explained by the discovery of <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s in 1932.

In 1917 <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Rutherford</a> bombarded <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> gas with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s and observed <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> nuclei being emitted from the gas (Rutherford recognized these, because he had previously obtained them bombarding hydrogen with alpha particles, and observing hydrogen nuclei in the products). Rutherford concluded that the hydrogen nuclei emerged from the nuclei of the nitrogen atoms themselves (in effect, he had split a nitrogen).

From his own work and the work of his students Bohr and <a href="Henry%20Moseley">Henry Moseley</a>, Rutherford knew that the positive charge of any atom could always be equated to that of an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. This, coupled with the <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> of many elements being <a href="Prout%27s%20law">roughly equivalent</a> to an integer number of hydrogen atoms - then assumed to be the lightest particles - led him to conclude that hydrogen nuclei were singular particles and a basic constituent of all atomic nuclei. He named such particles <a href="proton">proton</a>s. Further experimentation by Rutherford found that the nuclear mass of most atoms exceeded that of the protons it possessed; he speculated that this surplus mass was composed of previously-unknown neutrally charged particles, which were tentatively dubbed "<a href="neutron">neutron</a>s".

In 1928, <a href="Walter%20Bothe">Walter Bothe</a> observed that <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffin wax</a>. Initially it was thought to be high-energy <a href="gamma%20radiation">gamma radiation</a>, since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> found that the <a href="ionization">ionization</a> effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious "beryllium radiation", and by measuring the energies of the recoiling charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons. For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.

In 1924, <a href="Louis%20de%20Broglie">Louis de Broglie</a> proposed that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit a degree of wave-like behavior. <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a>, fascinated by this idea, explored whether or not the movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s%20equation">Schrödinger's equation</a>, published in 1926, describes an electron as a <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a> instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a>, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of wave–particle duality was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.

A consequence of describing electrons as waveforms is that it is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a> after the theoretical physicist <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The <a href="Atomic%20orbital%20model">modern model of the atom</a> describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>. The orbitals come in a variety of shapes-<a href="sphere">sphere</a>, <a href="dumbbell">dumbbell</a>, <a href="torus">torus</a>, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.

Aung San Suu Kyi

Aung San Suu Kyi (; ; born 19 June 1945) is a <a href="Myanmar">Burmese</a> politician, diplomat, and author. She is the leader of the <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">National League for Democracy</a> and the first and incumbent <a href="State%20Counsellor%20of%20Myanmar">State Counsellor</a>, a position akin to a Prime Minister. She is also the <a href="List%20of%20female%20foreign%20ministers">first woman</a> to serve as Minister for <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Myanmar%29">Foreign Affairs</a>, for the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20Myanmar">President's Office</a>, for Electric Power and Energy, and for <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Myanmar%29">Education</a>. From 2012 to 2016 she was an <a href="member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Kawhmu%20Township">Kawhmu Township</a> to the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Myanmar%29">House of Representatives</a>.

The youngest daughter of <a href="Aung%20San">Aung San</a>, <a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation">Father of the Nation</a> of modern-day Myanmar, and <a href="Khin%20Kyi">Khin Kyi</a>, Aung San Suu Kyi was born in <a href="Yangon">Rangoon</a>, <a href="British%20rule%20in%20Burma">British Burma</a>. After graduating from the <a href="University%20of%20Delhi">University of Delhi</a> in 1964 and the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> in 1968, she worked at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> for three years. She married <a href="Michael%20Aris">Michael Aris</a> in 1972, and gave birth to two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the <a href="8888%20Uprising">1988 Uprisings</a>, and became the General Secretary of the <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the <a href="Burmese%20general%20election%2C%201990">1990 elections</a>, NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the <a href="State%20Peace%20and%20Development%20Council">military</a> refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s.

Her party boycotted the <a href="Myanmar%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 elections</a>, resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed <a href="Union%20Solidarity%20and%20Development%20Party">Union Solidarity and Development Party</a>. Aung San Suu Kyi became a <a href="Pyithu%20Hluttaw">Pyithu Hluttaw</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the <a href="Burmese%20by-elections%2C%202012">2012 by-elections</a>. In the <a href="Myanmar%20general%20election%2C%202015">2015 elections</a>, her party won a <a href="landslide%20victory">landslide victory</a>, taking 86% of the seats in the <a href="Assembly%20of%20the%20Union">Assembly of the Union</a> – well more than the 67 percent <a href="supermajority">supermajority</a> needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected <a href="President%20of%20Myanmar">President</a> and <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Myanmar">Second Vice President</a> in the <a href="Presidential%20Electoral%20College">Presidential Electoral College</a>. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in <a href="Constitution%20of%20Myanmar">the constitution</a> – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of <a href="State%20Counsellor%20of%20Myanmar">State Counsellor</a>, a role akin to a <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Myanmar">Prime Minister</a> or a <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>. Aung San Suu Kyi's honours include the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>, which she won in 1991.

"Aung San Suu Kyi", like other <a href="Burmese%20names">Burmese names</a>, includes no <a href="surname">surname</a>, but is only a personal name, in her case derived from three relatives: "<a href="Aung%20San">Aung San</a>" from her father, "Suu" from her paternal grandmother, and "Kyi" from her mother Khin Kyi.

The Burmese refer to her as Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. "Daw", literally meaning "aunt", is not part of her name but is an <a href="Burmese%20names%23Honorifics">honorific</a> for any older and revered woman, akin to "<a href="Madam">Madam</a>". Burmese sometimes address her as Daw Suu or Amay Suu ("Mother Suu").

Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now <a href="Yangon">Yangon</a>), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung. Her father, <a href="Aung%20San">Aung San</a>, founded the <a href="Tatmadaw">modern Burmese army</a> and negotiated Burma's independence from the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in 1947; he was <a href="Burmese%20Martyrs%27%20Day">assassinated by his rivals</a> in the same year. She grew up with her mother, <a href="Khin%20Kyi">Khin Kyi</a>, and two brothers, Aung San Lin and <a href="Aung%20San%20Oo">Aung San Oo</a>, in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of <a href="Bogyoke%20Aung%20San%20Museum">the house</a>. Her elder brother emigrated to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California, becoming a <a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States citizen</a>. After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to <a href="54%20University%20Avenue">a house</a> by <a href="Inya%20Lake">Inya Lake</a> where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views and religions. She was educated in <a href="Basic%20Education%20High%20School%20No.%201%20Dagon">Methodist English High School</a> (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages. She speaks four languages: Burmese, English, French and Japanese. She is a <a href="Theravada">Theravada Buddhist</a>.
Suu Kyi's mother, <a href="Khin%20Kyi">Khin Kyi</a>, gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there. She studied in the Convent of Jesus and Mary School in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, and graduated from <a href="Lady%20Shri%20Ram%20College%20for%20Women">Lady Shri Ram College</a>, a constituent college of the <a href="University%20of%20Delhi">University of Delhi</a> in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>, with a degree in politics in 1964. Suu Kyi continued her education at <a href="St%20Hugh%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St Hugh's College, Oxford</a>, obtaining a B.A degree in <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a> in 1967, graduating with a third and M.A degree in politics in 1968. After graduating, she lived in New York City with family friend <a href="Than%20E">Ma Than E</a>, who was once a popular Burmese pop singer. She worked at the United Nations for three years, primarily on budget matters, writing daily to her future husband, <a href="Michael%20Aris">Dr. Michael Aris</a>. On 1 January 1972, Aung San Suu Kyi and Aris, a scholar of <a href="Tibetan%20culture">Tibetan culture</a>, living abroad in <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, were married. The following year she gave birth to their first son, <a href="Alexander%20Aris">Alexander Aris</a>, in London; their second son, Kim, was born in 1977. Between 1985 and 1987, Suu Kyi was working toward an <a href="M.Phil">M.Phil</a> degree in Burmese literature as a research student at <a href="School%20of%20Oriental%20and%20African%20Studies">SOAS</a>, the <a href="School%20of%20Oriental%20and%20African%20Studies">School of Oriental and African Studies</a>, <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>. She was elected as an Honorary Fellow of SOAS in 1990. For two years, she was a Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies (IIAS) in <a href="Shimla">Shimla</a>, India. She also worked for the <a href="Politics%20of%20Burma%23AFPFL/Union%20Government">government of the Union of Burma</a>.

In 1988, Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Suu Kyi met, as Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas. Aris was diagnosed with <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> in 1997 which was later found to be <a href="terminal%20illness">terminal</a>. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> and <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>, the Burmese government would not grant Aris a <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a>, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the <a href="military%20junta">military junta</a>'s assurance that she could return.

Aris died on his 53rd birthday on 27 March 1999. Since 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995. She was also separated from her children, who live in the United Kingdom, but starting in 2011, they have visited her in Burma.

On 2 May 2008, after <a href="Cyclone%20Nargis">Cyclone Nargis</a> hit Burma, Suu Kyi lost the roof of her house and lived in virtual darkness after losing electricity in her dilapidated lakeside residence. She used candles at night as she was not provided any generator set. Plans to renovate and repair the house were announced in August 2009. Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.

Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the <a href="Burma%20Socialist%20Programme%20Party">ruling party</a>, General <a href="Ne%20Win">Ne Win</a>, stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the <a href="8888%20Uprising">8888 Uprising</a>. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the <a href="Shwedagon%20Pagoda">Shwedagon Pagoda</a> in the capital, calling for a democratic government. However, in September, a <a href="State%20Peace%20and%20Development%20Council">new military junta</a> took power.

Influenced by both <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s philosophy of <a href="nonviolence">non-violence</a> and more specifically by Buddhist concepts, Aung San Suu Kyi entered politics to work for <a href="democratization">democratization</a>, helped found the <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">National League for Democracy</a> on 27 September 1988, but was put under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> on 20 July 1989. Offered freedom if she left the country, she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD. However, she retained enormous popularity and support among NLD youths with whom she spent most of her time.

During her time under house arrest, Suu Kyi devoted herself to Buddhist meditation practices and to studying Buddhist thought. This deeper interest in Buddhism is reflected in her writings as more emphasis is put on love and compassion. There also emerged more discussion on the compatibility of democracy and Buddhism and the ability of gaining freedom from an authoritarian government through Buddhism.

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, <a href="U%20Nu">U Nu</a> initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister <a href="Rajiv%20Gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying "the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people". Ex-Brigadier General <a href="Aung%20Gyi">Aung Gyi</a>, another influential politician at the time of the 8888 crisis and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Suu Kyi's refusal. Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.
In 1990, the military junta called a <a href="Burmese%20general%20election%2C%201990">general election</a>, in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats. Some claim that Aung San Suu Kyi would have assumed the office of Prime Minister; in fact, however, as she was not permitted , she did not stand as a candidate in the elections (although being a member of parliament is not a strict prerequisite for becoming <a href="prime%20minister">prime minister</a> in most parliamentary systems ). Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue () in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the <a href="Sakharov%20Prize">Sakharov Prize</a> for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> the year after. Her sons <a href="Alexander%20Aris">Alexander</a> and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf. Aung San Suu Kyi used the Nobel Peace Prize's 1.3 million USD prize money to establish a health and education trust for the Burmese people. Around this time, Aung San Suu Kyi chose <a href="non-violence">non-violence</a> as an expedient political tactic, stating in 2007, "I do not hold to non-violence for moral reasons, but for political and practical reasons."

On 9 November 1996, the <a href="motorcade">motorcade</a> that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">National League for Democracy</a> leaders <a href="Tin%20Oo">Tin Oo</a> and <a href="Kyi%20Maung">Kyi Maung</a>, was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the <a href="Union%20Solidarity%20and%20Development%20Association">Union Solidarity and Development Association</a> (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 <a href="kyat">kyat</a>s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken. (Amnesty International 120297)

Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career, during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her. She also passed the time playing the piano, and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: "As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me. I never forget that my colleagues who are in prison suffer not only physically, but mentally for their families who have no security outside- in the larger prison of Burma under authoritarian rule." Her loyalty to the people of Burma and her solidarity with those imprisoned for their pro-democratic acts have earned her deep respect among the Burmese people.

The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist <a href="Maurizio%20Giuliano">Maurizio Giuliano</a>, after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes. In contrast, Aung San Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, General <a href="Than%20Shwe">Than Shwe</a> and General <a href="Khin%20Nyunt">Khin Nyunt</a> on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention. On several occasions during her house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalized.

The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial), and Section 22 of the "Law to Safeguard the State Against the Dangers of Those Desiring to Cause Subversive Acts" as legal tools against her. She continuously appealed her detention, and many nations and figures continued to call for her release and that of 2,100 other political prisoners in the country. On 12 November 2010, days after the junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won elections conducted after a gap of 20 years, the junta finally agreed to sign orders allowing Suu Kyi's release, and Suu Kyi's house arrest term came to an end on 13 November 2010.

The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the <a href="military%20junta">junta</a> and Aung San Suu Kyi. On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a <a href="Depayin%20massacre">government-sponsored mob attacked</a> her caravan in the northern village of <a href="Tabayin">Depayin</a>, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching <a href="Ye-U">Ye-U</a>. The government imprisoned her at <a href="Insein%20Prison">Insein Prison</a> in Rangoon. After she underwent a <a href="hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a> in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; <a href="Razali%20Ismail">Razali Ismail</a>, UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions. Several years later in 2006, <a href="Ibrahim%20Gambari">Ibrahim Gambari</a>, UN <a href="Under-Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Undersecretary-General</a> (USG) of <a href="United%20Nations%20Department%20of%20Political%20Affairs">Department of Political Affairs</a>, met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004. He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year. On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing <a href="Than%20Shwe">Than Shwe</a> and other members of the senior leadership in <a href="Naypyidaw">Naypyidaw</a>. <a href="State%20television">State television</a> broadcast Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice. This was Suu Kyi's first appearance in state media in the four years since her current detention began.

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the <a href="Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time. The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government's reply, "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety", and while "it could have instituted legal action against her under the country's domestic legislation ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests."

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General <a href="Khin%20Yi">Khin Yi</a>, Chief of <a href="Myanmar%20Police%20Force">Myanmar Police Force</a> (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the <a href="State%20media">state-run</a> paper "<a href="New%20Light%20of%20Myanmar">New Light of Myanmar</a>" accused Suu Kyi of <a href="tax%20evasion">tax evasion</a> for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).

In November 2007, it was reported that Suu Kyi would meet her political allies <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">National League for Democracy</a> along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy <a href="Ibrahim%20Gambari">Ibrahim Gambari</a> ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi. However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General <a href="Ban%20Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader <a href="Than%20Shwe">Than Shwe</a> refused permission for him to visit Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity."


Protests led by Buddhist monks began on 19 August 2007 following steep fuel price increases, and continued each day, despite the threat of a crackdown by the military.

On 22 September 2007, although still under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a>, Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of her residence in Yangon to accept the blessings of Buddhist monks who were marching in support of human rights. It was reported that she had been moved the following day to <a href="Insein%20Prison">Insein Prison</a> (where she had been detained in 2003), but meetings with UN envoy <a href="Ibrahim%20Gambari">Ibrahim Gambari</a> near her Rangoon home on 30 September and 2 October established that she remained under house arrest.

On 3 May 2009, an American man, identified as John Yettaw, swam across <a href="Inya%20Lake">Inya Lake</a> to <a href="54%20University%20Avenue">her house</a> uninvited and was arrested when he made his return trip three days later. He had attempted to make a similar trip two years earlier, but for unknown reasons was turned away. He later claimed at trial that he was motivated by a divine vision requiring him to notify her of an impending terrorist assassination attempt. On 13 May, Suu Kyi was arrested for violating the terms of her house arrest because the swimmer, who pleaded exhaustion, was allowed to stay in her house for two days before he attempted the swim back. Suu Kyi was later taken to <a href="Insein%20Prison">Insein Prison</a>, where she could have faced up to five years <a href="solitary%20confinement">confinement</a> for the intrusion. The trial of Suu Kyi and her two maids began on 18 May and a small number of protesters gathered outside. Diplomats and journalists were barred from attending the trial; however, on one occasion, several diplomats from Russia, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and Singapore and journalists were allowed to meet Suu Kyi. The prosecution had originally planned to call 22 witnesses. It also accused John Yettaw of embarrassing the country. During the ongoing defence case, Suu Kyi said she was innocent. The defence was allowed to call only one witness (out of four), while the prosecution was permitted to call 14 witnesses. The court rejected two character witnesses, NLD members <a href="Tin%20Oo">Tin Oo</a> and <a href="Win%20Tin">Win Tin</a>, and permitted the defence to call only a legal expert. According to one unconfirmed report, the junta was planning to, once again, place her in detention, this time in a military base outside the city. In a separate trial, Yettaw said he swam to Suu Kyi's house to warn her that her life was "in danger". The national police chief later confirmed that Yettaw was the "main culprit" in the case filed against Suu Kyi. According to aides, Suu Kyi spent her 64th birthday in jail sharing <a href="biryani">biryani</a> rice and chocolate cake with her guards.

Her arrest and subsequent trial received worldwide condemnation by the UN Secretary General <a href="Ban%20Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a>, Western governments, South Africa, Japan and the <a href="ASEAN">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a>, of which Burma is a member. The Burmese government strongly condemned the statement, as it created an "unsound tradition" and criticised <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> for meddling in its internal affairs. The Burmese Foreign Minister <a href="Nyan%20Win">Nyan Win</a> was quoted in the state-run newspaper "New Light of Myanmar" as saying that the incident "was trumped up to intensify international pressure on Burma by internal and external anti-government elements who do not wish to see the positive changes in those countries' policies toward Burma". Ban responded to an international campaign by flying to Burma to negotiate, but Than Shwe rejected all of his requests.

On 11 August 2009 the trial concluded with Suu Kyi being sentenced to imprisonment for three years with hard labour. This sentence was <a href="Pardon">commuted</a> by the military rulers to further house arrest of 18 months. On 14 August, <a href="U.S.%20Senator">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="Jim%20Webb">Jim Webb</a> visited Burma, visiting with junta leader Gen. <a href="Than%20Shwe">Than Shwe</a> and later with Suu Kyi. During the visit, Webb negotiated Yettaw's release and deportation from Burma. Following the verdict of the trial, lawyers of Suu Kyi said they would appeal against the 18-month sentence. On 18 August, United States President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> asked the country's military leadership to set free all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. In her appeal, Aung San Suu Kyi had argued that the conviction was unwarranted. However, her appeal against the August sentence was rejected by a Burmese court on 2 October 2009. Although the court accepted the argument that the 1974 constitution, under which she had been charged, was null and void, it also said the provisions of the 1975 security law, under which she has been kept under house arrest, remained in force. The verdict effectively meant that she would be unable to participate in the elections scheduled to take place in 2010 – the first in Burma in two decades. Her lawyer stated that her legal team would pursue a new appeal within 60 days.

It was announced prior to the <a href="Burmese%20general%20election%2C%202010">Burmese general election</a> that Aung San Suu Kyi may be released "so she can organize her party," However, Suu Kyi was not allowed to run. On 1 October 2010 the government announced that she would be released on 13 November 2010.

U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> personally advocated the release of all political prisoners, especially Aung San Suu Kyi, during the US-<a href="ASEAN">ASEAN</a> Summit of 2009.

The U.S. Government hoped that successful general elections would be an optimistic indicator of the Burmese government's sincerity towards eventual democracy. The <a href="Yukio%20Hatoyama">Hatoyama</a> government which spent 2.82 billion yen in 2008, has promised more Japanese foreign aid to encourage Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi in time for the elections; and to continue moving towards democracy and the rule of law.

In a personal letter to Suu Kyi, UK Prime Minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> cautioned the Burmese government of the potential consequences of rigging elections as "condemning Burma to more years of diplomatic isolation and economic stagnation".

Suu Kyi has met with many heads of state, and opened a dialog with the Minister of Labor Aung Kyi (not to be confused with Aung San Suu Kyi). She was allowed to meet with senior members of her <a href="National%20League%20for%20Democracy">NLD</a> party at the State House, however these meetings took place under close supervision.

On the evening of 13 November 2010, Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. This was the date her detention had been set to expire according to a court ruling in August 2009 and came six days after a widely criticised <a href="Burmese%20general%20election%2C%202010">general election</a>. She appeared in front of a crowd of her supporters, who rushed to her house in Rangoon when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces. Suu Kyi had been detained for 15 of the past 21 years. The government newspaper "New Light of Myanmar" reported the release positively, saying she had been granted a pardon after serving her sentence "in good conduct". <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a> suggested that the military government may have released Suu Kyi because it felt it was in a confident position to control her supporters after the election. The role that Suu Kyi will play in the future of democracy in Burma remains a subject of much debate.

Her son Kim Aris was granted a visa in November 2010 to see his mother shortly after her release, for the first time in 10 years. He visited again on 5 July 2011, to accompany her on a trip to <a href="Bagan">Bagan</a>, her first trip outside <a href="Yangon">Yangon</a> since 2003. Her son visited again on 8 August 2011, to accompany her on a trip to <a href="Pegu">Pegu</a>, her second trip.

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Burma's political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.

In November 2011, following a meeting of its leaders, the NLD announced its intention to re-register as a political party in order to contend 48 by-elections necessitated by the promotion of parliamentarians to ministerial rank. Following the decision, Suu Kyi held a telephone conference with U.S. President Barack Obama, in which it was agreed that Secretary of State <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> would make a visit to Burma, a move received with caution by Burma's ally China. On 1 December 2011, Suu Kyi met with Hillary Clinton at the residence of the top-ranking US diplomat in Yangon.

On 21 December 2011, Thai Prime Minister <a href="Yingluck%20Shinawatra">Yingluck Shinawatra</a> met Suu Kyi in Yangoon, marking Suu Kyi's "first-ever meeting with the leader of a foreign country".

On 5 January 2012, British Foreign Minister William Hague met Aung San Suu Kyi and his Burmese counterpart. This represented a significant visit for Suu Kyi and Burma. Suu Kyi studied in the UK and maintains many ties there, whilst Britain is Burma's largest bilateral donor.
During Aung San Suu Kyi's visit to Europe, she visited the Swiss parliament, collected her 1991 Nobel Prize in Oslo and her honorary degree from Oxford University.

In December 2011, there was speculation that Suu Kyi would run in the <a href="Burmese%20by-elections%2C%202012">2012 national by-elections</a> to fill vacant seats. On 18 January 2012, Suu Kyi formally registered to contest a <a href="Pyithu%20Hluttaw">Pyithu Hluttaw</a> (lower house) seat in the <a href="Kawhmu%20Township">Kawhmu Township</a> constituency in special parliamentary elections to be held on 1 April 2012. The seat was previously held by Soe Tint, who vacated it after being appointed Construction Deputy Minister, in the <a href="Burmese%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 election</a>. She ran against <a href="Union%20Solidarity%20and%20Development%20Party">Union Solidarity and Development Party</a> candidate Soe Min, a retired army physician and native of <a href="Twante%20Township">Twante Township</a>.

On 3 March 2012, at a large campaign rally in <a href="Mandalay">Mandalay</a>, Suu Kyi unexpectedly left after 15 minutes, because of exhaustion and airsickness.

In an official campaign speech broadcast on Burmese state television's <a href="MRTV">MRTV</a> on 14 March 2012, Suu Kyi publicly campaigned for reform of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Burma">2008 Constitution</a>, removal of restrictive laws, more adequate protections for people's democratic rights, and establishment of an independent judiciary. The speech was leaked online a day before it was broadcast. A paragraph in the speech, focusing on the <a href="Tatmadaw">Tatmadaw</a>'s repression by means of law, was censored by authorities.

Suu Kyi has also called for international media to monitor the upcoming by-elections, while publicly pointing out irregularities in official voter lists, which include deceased individuals and exclude other eligible voters in the contested constituencies. On 21 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was quoted as saying "Fraud and rule violations are continuing and we can even say they are increasing."

When asked whether she would assume a ministerial post if given the opportunity, she said the following:

On 26 March 2012, Suu Kyi suspended her nationwide campaign tour early, after a campaign rally in <a href="Myeik%2C%20Burma">Myeik</a> (Mergui), a coastal town in the south, citing health problems due to exhaustion and hot weather.
On 1 April 2012, the NLD announced that Suu Kyi had won the vote for a seat in Parliament. A news broadcast on state-run <a href="MRTV">MRTV</a>, reading the announcements of the <a href="Union%20Election%20Commission">Union Election Commission</a>, confirmed her victory, as well as her party's victory in 43 of the 45 contested seats, officially making Suu Kyi the <a href="Opposition%20%28Myanmar%29">Leader of the Opposition</a> in the <a href="Assembly%20of%20the%20Union">Pyidaungsu Hluttaw</a>.

Although she and other MP-elects were expected to take office on 23 April when the Hluttaws resume session, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Suu Kyi, said they might not take their oaths because of its wording; in its present form, parliamentarians must vow to "safeguard" the constitution. In an address on <a href="Radio%20Free%20Asia">Radio Free Asia</a>, she said "We don't mean we will not attend the parliament, we mean we will attend only after taking the oath... Changing that wording in the oath is also in conformity with the Constitution. I don't expect there will be any difficulty in doing it."

On 2 May 2012, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, took their oaths and took office, though the wording of the oath was not changed. According to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>, "Suu Kyi and her colleagues decided they could do more by joining as lawmakers than maintaining their boycott on principle."
On 9 July 2012, she attended the Parliament for the first time as a lawmaker.
On 6 July 2012, Suu Kyi announced on the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a>'s website that she wanted to run for the presidency in <a href="Myanmar%20general%20election%2C%202015">Myanmar's 2015 elections</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Burma%232008%20Constitution">current Constitution</a>, which came into <a href="Burmese%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202008">effect in 2008</a>, bars her from the presidency because she is the widow and mother of foreigners – provisions that appeared to be written specifically to prevent her from being eligible.
The NLD won a sweeping victory in those elections, winning at least 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 135 seats in the House of Nationalities. In addition, Suu Kyi won re-election to the House of Representatives. Under the 2008 constitution, the NLD needed to win at least a two-thirds majority in both houses to ensure that its candidate would become president. Before the elections, Suu Kyi announced that even though she is constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government. On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President's Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President <a href="Htin%20Kyaw">Htin Kyaw</a>'s government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her <a href="State%20Counsellor%20%28Myanmar%29">State Counsellor</a>, a position akin to a <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Myanmar">Prime Minister</a> created especially for her.

As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister <a href="Wang%20Yi%20%28politician%29">Wang Yi</a>, Canadian Foreign Minister <a href="Stephane%20Dion">Stephane Dion</a> and Italian Foreign Minister <a href="Paolo%20Gentiloni">Paolo Gentiloni</a> in April and Japanese Foreign Minister <a href="Fumio%20Kishida">Fumio Kishida</a> in May and discussed to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.

Initially, upon accepting the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to the students who were arrested for opposing the <a href="Myanmar%20National%20Education%20Law%202014">National Education Bill</a>, and announced a creation of the commission on <a href="Rakhine%20state">Rakhine state</a>, which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim <a href="Rohingya">Rohingya</a> minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in <a href="Shan%20state">Shan</a> and <a href="Kachin%20state">Kachin state</a>s, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and eventually the persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing. She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.

Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the <a href="Asian%20countries">Asian countries</a> like <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, and <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>." She also cited "the <a href="eastern%20European">eastern European</a> countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the <a href="Latin%20American">Latin American</a> countries, which made the transition from military governments. "And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." She added: "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."

In a nod to the deep US political divide between <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> led by <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> of <a href="Barack%20Obama">Obama</a>—then battling to win the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012 Presidential election</a>—she stressed with a smile, "Those of you who are familiar with American politics I'm sure understand the need for negotiated compromise."

Aung San Suu Kyi has received vocal support from Western nations in Europe, Australia and North and South America, as well as India, Israel, Japan the Philippines and South Korea. In December 2007, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously 400–0 to award Aung San Suu Kyi the <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>; the Senate concurred on 25 April 2008. On 6 May 2008, President George W. Bush signed legislation awarding Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal. She is the first recipient in American history to receive the prize while imprisoned. More recently, there has been growing criticism of her detention by Burma's neighbours in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, particularly from Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore. At one point Malaysia warned Burma that it faced expulsion from ASEAN as a result of the detention of Suu Kyi. Other nations including South Africa, Bangladesh and the Maldives also called for her release. The United Nations has urged the country to move towards inclusive national reconciliation, the restoration of democracy, and full respect for human rights. In December 2008, the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> passed a resolution condemning the <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20Burma">human rights situation in Burma</a> and calling for Suu Kyi's release—80 countries voting for the resolution, 25 against and 45 abstentions. Other nations, such as China and Russia, are less critical of the regime and prefer to cooperate only on economic matters. Indonesia has urged China to push Burma for reforms. However, <a href="Samak%20Sundaravej">Samak Sundaravej</a>, former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Thailand">Prime Minister of Thailand</a>, criticised the amount of support for Suu Kyi, saying that "Europe uses Aung San Suu Kyi as a tool. If it's not related to Aung San Suu Kyi, you can have deeper discussions with Myanmar."

<a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, however, did not support calls by other ASEAN member states for Myanmar to free Aung San Suu Kyi, state media reported Friday, 14 August 2009. The state-run <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Nam%20News">Việt Nam News</a> said Vietnam had no criticism of Myanmar's decision 11 August 2009 to place Suu Kyi under house arrest for the next 18 months, effectively barring her from elections scheduled for 2010. "It is our view that the Aung San Suu Kyi trial is an internal affair of Myanmar", Vietnamese government spokesman Le Dung stated on the website of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Vietnam%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>. In contrast with other ASEAN member states, Dung said Vietnam has always supported Myanmar and hopes it will continue to implement the "<a href="roadmap%20to%20democracy">roadmap to democracy</a>" outlined by its government.

Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1991. The decision of the Nobel Committee mentions:
In 1995 Aung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the <a href="Fourth%20World%20Conference%20on%20Women">Fourth World Conference on Women</a> in Beijing.

Nobel Peace Prize winners (Archbishop <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, <a href="14th%20Dalai%20Lama">the Dalai Lama</a>, <a href="Shirin%20Ebadi">Shirin Ebadi</a>, <a href="Adolfo%20P%C3%A9rez%20Esquivel">Adolfo Pérez Esquivel</a>, <a href="Mairead%20Corrigan">Mairead Corrigan</a>, <a href="Rigoberta%20Mench%C3%BA">Rigoberta Menchú</a>, Prof. <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, U.S. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, <a href="Betty%20Williams%20%28Nobel%20laureate%29">Betty Williams</a>, <a href="Jody%20Williams">Jody Williams</a> and former U.S. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>) called for the rulers of Burma to release Suu Kyi in order to "create the necessary conditions for a genuine dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all concerned parties and ethnic groups in order to achieve an inclusive national reconciliation with the direct support of the United Nations." Some of the money she received as part of the award helps fund London-based charity Prospect Burma, which provides higher education grants to Burmese students.

On 16 June 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi was finally able to deliver her Nobel acceptance speech (<a href="Nobel%20lecture">Nobel lecture</a>) at <a href="Oslo%20City%20Hall">Oslo's City Hall</a>, two decades after being awarded the peace prize.

In September 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi received in person the United States <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>, which is the highest Congressional award. Although she was awarded this medal in 2008, at the time she was under house arrest, and was unable to receive the medal. Aung San Suu Kyi was greeted with bipartisan support at Congress, as part of a coast-to-coast tour in the United States. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi met President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. The experience was described by Aung San Suu Kyi as "one of the most moving days of my life."
As of 2014, she is listed as the 61st most powerful woman in the world by "Forbes".


In 2017, critics have called for Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the <a href="Persecution%20of%20Muslims%20in%20Burma">persecution of Rohingya Muslims</a> in Myanmar.
Some activists criticised Aung San Suu Kyi for her silence on the <a href="2012%20Rakhine%20State%20riots">2012 Rakhine State riots</a> (later repeated during the <a href="2015%20Rohingya%20refugee%20crisis">2015 Rohingya refugee crisis</a>), and her perceived indifference to the plight of the <a href="Rohingya">Rohingya</a>, Myanmar’s persecuted Muslim minority. In 2012, she told reporters she did not know if the <a href="Rohingya%20people">Rohingya</a> could be regarded as Burmese citizens. In a 2013 interview with the BBC's <a href="Mishal%20Husain">Mishal Husain</a>, Suu Kyi did not condemn violence against the Rohingya and denied that Muslims in Myanmar have been subject to <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>, insisting that the tensions were due to a “climate of fear” caused by “a worldwide perception that global Muslim power is ‘very great’.” She did condemn “hate of any kind” in the interview. According to Peter Popham, in the aftermath of the interview, she expressed anger at being interviewed by a Muslim. Husain had challenged Suu Kyi that almost all of the impact of violence was against the Rohingya, in response to Suu Kyi’s claim that violence was happening on both sides, and Peter Popham described her position on the issue as one of purposeful ambiguity for political gain.

However, she said that she wanted to work towards reconciliation and she cannot take sides as violence has been committed by both sides. According to "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>", her “halo has even slipped among foreign human-rights lobbyists, disappointed at her failure to make a clear stand on behalf of the Rohingya minority.” However, she has spoken out “against a ban on Rohingya families near the Bangladeshi border having more than two children.”

In a 2015 BBC News article, reporter <a href="Jonah%20Fisher">Jonah Fisher</a> suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi’s silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority <a href="Bamar%20people">Bamar</a> ethnicity as she is in “the middle of <a href="Myanma%20general%20election%2C%202015">a general election</a> campaign”. In May 2015, the <a href="14th%20Dalai%20Lama">Dalai Lama</a> publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging. In May 2016, Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Myanmar">United States Ambassador to Myanmar</a>, <a href="Scot%20Marciel">Scot Marciel</a>, not to refer to the Rohingya by that name. This followed <a href="Bamar%20people">Bamar</a> protests at Marciel’s use of the word “Rohingya”.

In 2016, Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar’s <a href="Rohingya%20people">Rohingya Muslims</a> during the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Rohingya%20persecution%20in%20Myanmar">2016–17 persecution</a>. State crime experts from <a href="Queen%20Mary%20University%20of%20London">Queen Mary University of London</a> warned that Suu Kyi is “legitimising genocide” in Myanmar. Despite continued persecution of the Rohingya well into 2017, Suu Kyi was “not even admitting, let alone trying to stop, the army’s well-documented campaign of rape, murder and destruction against Rohingya villages.” On 4 September 2017, <a href="Yanghee%20Lee">Yanghee Lee</a>, the UN’s special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, criticised Suu Kyi’s response to the “really grave” situation in <a href="Rakhine%20state">Rakhine</a>, saying: “The de facto leader needs to step in – that is what we would expect from any government, to protect everybody within their own jurisdiction.” The BBC reported that “Her comments came as the number of Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh reached 87,000, according to UN estimates”, adding that “her sentiments were echoed by Nobel Peace laureate <a href="Malala%20Yousafzai">Malala Yousafzai</a>, who said she was waiting to hear from Ms Suu Kyi – who has not commented on the crisis since it erupted.” The next day <a href="George%20Monbiot">George Monbiot</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", called on readers to sign a <a href="change.org">change.org</a> petition to have the Nobel peace prize revoked, criticising her silence on the matter and asserting “whether out of prejudice or out of fear, she denies to others the freedoms she rightly claimed for herself. Her regime excludes – and in some cases seeks to silence – the very activists who helped to ensure her own rights were recognised.” The <a href="Nobel%20Foundation">Nobel Foundation</a> replied that there existed no provision for revoking a Nobel Prize. Archbishop <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, a fellow peace prize holder, also criticised Suu Kyi’s silence: in an open letter published on social media, he said “If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep ... It is incongruous for a symbol of righteousness to lead such a country.” On September 13 it was revealed that Suu Kyi would not be attending a <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">UN General Assembly</a> debate being held the following week to discuss the humanitarian crisis, with a Myanmar government spokesman stating “perhaps she has more pressing matters to deal with”.

The life of Suu Kyi and her husband Michael Aris is portrayed in <a href="Luc%20Besson">Luc Besson</a>'s 2011 film "<a href="The%20Lady%20%282011%20film%29">The Lady</a>", in which they are played by <a href="Michelle%20Yeoh">Michelle Yeoh</a> and <a href="David%20Thewlis">David Thewlis</a>. Yeoh visited Suu Kyi in 2011 before the film's release in November. In the <a href="John%20Boorman">John Boorman</a>'s 1995 film "<a href="Beyond%20Rangoon">Beyond Rangoon</a>", Suu Kyi was played by <a href="Adelle%20Lutz">Adelle Lutz</a>.

Since 2009, Indian actress and <a href="Bharathanatyam">Bharathanatyam</a> dancer <a href="Rukmini%20Vijayakumar">Rukmini Vijayakumar</a> has been portraying as Suu Kyi in an <a href="one-act%20play">one-act play</a> titled "The Lady of Burma" directed by <a href="Prakash%20Belawadi">Prakash Belawadi</a>, which also happens to be an <a href="eponymous">eponymous</a> play written by Richard Shannon.

U2's Bono wrote the song <a href="Walk%20On%20%28U2%20song%29">"Walk On"</a> in tribute to Suu Kyi, and publicized her plight during the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a>, 2009-2011. <a href="Saxophone">Saxophonist</a> <a href="Wayne%20Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a> composed a song titled "Aung San Suu Kyi". It appears on his albums "<a href="1%20%2B%201%20%28album%29">1 + 1</a>" (with pianist <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>) and "<a href="Footprints%20Live%21">Footprints Live!</a>" 

She had surgery for a gynecological condition in September 2003 at <a href="Asia%20Royal%20Cardiac%20%26amp%3B%20Medical%20Care%20Centre">Asia Royal Hospital</a> during her house arrest. She underwent minor foot surgery in December 2013 and eye surgery in April 2016. <a href="Tin%20Myo%20Win">Her doctor</a> said that she had no serious health problems but weighed only 48 kg, had low blood pressure and could become weak easily.

Abraham Joshua Heschel

Abraham Joshua Heschel (January 11, 1907 – December 23, 1972) was a Polish-born American <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> and one of the leading <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> theologians and Jewish philosophers of the 20th century. Heschel, a professor of <a href="Jewish%20mysticism">Jewish mysticism</a> at the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a>, authored a number of widely read books on <a href="Jewish%20philosophy">Jewish philosophy</a> and was active in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>.

Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in 1907 as the youngest of six children of Moshe Mordechai and Reizel Perlow. He was descended from preeminent European <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>s on both sides of his family. His paternal great-great-grandfather and namesake was <a href="Rebbe">Rebbe</a> <a href="Avraham%20Yehoshua%20Heshel">Avraham Yehoshua Heshel</a> of <a href="Opat%C3%B3w">Apt</a> in present-day Poland. His mother was also a descendant of Avraham Yehoshua Heshel and other <a href="Hasidic%20dynasties">Hasidic dynasties</a>. His siblings were Sarah, Dvora Miriam, Esther Sima, Gittel, and Jacob. Their father Moshe died of <a href="influenza">influenza</a> in 1916 when Abraham was nine.

After a traditional <a href="yeshiva">yeshiva</a> education and studying for Orthodox rabbinical ordination <a href="semicha">semicha</a>, Heschel pursued his doctorate at the <a href="University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a> and a liberal rabbinic ordination at the <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20die%20Wissenschaft%20des%20Judentums">Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums</a>. There he studied under some of the finest Jewish educators of the time: <a href="Hanoch%20Albeck">Chanoch Albeck</a>, <a href="Ismar%20Elbogen">Ismar Elbogen</a>, <a href="Julius%20Guttmann">Julius Guttmann</a>, and <a href="Leo%20Baeck">Leo Baeck</a>. His mentor in Berlin was <a href="David%20Koigen">David Koigen</a>. Heschel later taught <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> at the Hochschule. He joined a <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> poetry group, Jung Vilna, and in 1933, published a volume of Yiddish poems, "Der Shem Hamefoyrosh: Mentsch," dedicated to his father.

In late October 1938, when Heschel was living in a rented room in the home of a Jewish family in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, he was arrested by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> and deported to Poland. He spent ten months lecturing on <a href="Jewish%20philosophy">Jewish philosophy</a> and <a href="Torah">Torah</a> at Warsaw's <a href="Institute%20for%20Jewish%20Studies">Institute for Jewish Studies</a>. Six weeks before the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">German invasion of Poland</a>, Heschel left Warsaw for London with the help of <a href="Julian%20Morgenstern">Julian Morgenstern</a>, president of <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a>, who had been working to obtain visas for Jewish scholars in Europe.

Heschel's sister Esther was killed in a German bombing. His mother was murdered by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazis</a>, and two other sisters, Gittel and Devorah, died in <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>. He never returned to Germany, Austria or Poland. He once wrote, "If I should go to Poland or Germany, every stone, every tree would remind me of contempt, hatred, murder, of children killed, of mothers burned alive, of human beings asphyxiated."

Heschel arrived in New York City in March 1940. He served on the faculty of <a href="Hebrew%20Union%20College">Hebrew Union College</a> (HUC), the main seminary of <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>, in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> for five years. In 1946, he took a position at the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a> (JTS) in New York City, the main seminary of <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative Judaism</a>. He served as professor of <a href="Jewish%20ethics">Jewish ethics</a> and <a href="Kabbalah">Mysticism</a> until his death in 1972.

Heschel married Sylvia Straus, a concert pianist, on December 10, 1946, in Los Angeles. Their daughter, <a href="Susannah%20Heschel">Susannah Heschel</a>, became a Jewish scholar in her own right. Heschel's papers are held in the <a href="Rubenstein%20Rare%20Book%20%26amp%3B%20Manuscript%20Library">Rubenstein Rare pageRank.Book & Manuscript Library</a> at <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>.

Heschel explicated many facets of Jewish thought, including studies on medieval Jewish philosophy, <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, and <a href="Hasidism">Hasidism</a>. According to some scholars, he was more interested in spirituality than in critical text study; the latter was a specialty of many scholars at JTS. He was not given a graduate assistant for many years and was relegated to teach mainly in the education school or Rabbinical school, not in the academic graduate program. Heschel became friendly with his colleague <a href="Mordecai%20Kaplan">Mordecai Kaplan</a>. Though they differed in their approach to Judaism, they had a very cordial relationship and visited each other's homes from time to time.

Heschel believed the teachings of the Hebrew prophets were a clarion call for social action in the United States and worked for African Americans' <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> and against the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

He also specifically criticized what he called "pan-halakhism", or an exclusive focus upon religiously compatible behavior to the neglect of the non-legalistic dimension of rabbinic tradition.

Heschel is a widely read Jewish theologian whose most influential works include "Man Is Not Alone", "God in Search of Man", "The Sabbath," and "The Prophets". At the <a href="Vatican%20Council%20II">Vatican Council II</a>, as representative of <a href="American%20Jews">American Jews</a>, Heschel persuaded the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> to eliminate or modify passages in its liturgy that demeaned the Jews, or referred to an expected conversion to Christianity. His theological works argued that religious experience is a fundamentally human impulse, not just a Jewish one. He believed that no religious community could claim a monopoly on religious truth.

"The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man" is a work on the nature and celebration of <a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, the Jewish Sabbath. This work is rooted in the thesis that Judaism is a religion of time, not space, and that the Sabbath symbolizes the sanctification of time.

"Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion" offers Heschel's views on how people can comprehend God. Judaism views God as being radically different from humans, so Heschel explores the ways that Judaism teaches that a person may have an encounter with the ineffable. A recurring theme in this work is the radical amazement that people feel when experiencing the presence of the Divine. Heschel then goes on to explore the problems of doubts and faith; what Judaism means by teaching that God is one; the essence of humanity and the problem of human needs; the definition of religion in general and of Judaism in particular; and human yearning for spirituality. He offers his views as to Judaism being a pattern for life.

"<a href="God%20in%20Search%20of%20Man">God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism</a>" is a companion volume to "Man Is Not Alone". In this book Heschel discusses the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. He discusses ways that people can seek God's presence, and the radical amazement that we receive in return. He offers a criticism of nature worship; a study of humanity's metaphysical loneliness, and his view that we can consider God to be in search of humanity. The first section concludes with a study of <a href="Jews%20as%20a%20chosen%20people">Jews as a chosen people</a>. Section two deals with the idea of <a href="revelation">revelation</a>, and what it means for one to be a prophet. This section gives us his idea of revelation as an event, as opposed to a process. This relates to Israel's commitment to God. Section three discusses his views of how a Jew should understand the nature of Judaism as a religion. He discusses and rejects the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, but then cautions against rabbis he sees as adding too many restrictions to Jewish law. He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of <a href="Kavanah">Kavanah</a> (intention) when performing <a href="mitzvot">mitzvot</a>. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism—when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

This work started out as his PhD thesis in German, which he later expanded and translated into English. Originally published in a two-volume edition, this work studies the books of the Hebrew prophets. It covers their lives and the historical context that their missions were set in, summarizes their work, and discusses their psychological state. In it Heschel puts forward what would become a central idea in his theology: that the prophetic (and, ultimately, Jewish) view of God is best understood not as anthropomorphic (that God takes human form) but rather as anthropopathic—that God has human feelings.

In his book "The Prophets", Abraham Joshua Heschel describes the unique aspect of the Jewish prophets as compared to other similar figures. Whereas other nations have soothsayers and diviners who attempt to discover the will of their gods, according to Heschel the Hebrew prophets are characterized by their experience of what he calls theotropism—God turning towards humanity. Heschel argues for the view of Hebrew prophets as receivers of the "Divine <a href="Pathos">Pathos</a>", of the wrath and sorrow of God over his nation that has forsaken him. In this view, prophets do not speak for God so much as they remind their audience of God's voice for the voiceless, the poor and oppressed.

He writes:
Many consider Heschel's "Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot", ("Torah from Heaven in the mirror of the generations") to be his masterwork. The three volumes of this work are a study of classical rabbinic theology and <a href="aggadah">aggadah</a>, as opposed to <a href="halakha">halakha</a> (Jewish law.) It explores the views of the rabbis in the <a href="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>, <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> and <a href="Midrash">Midrash</a> about the nature of <a href="Torah">Torah</a>, the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts. In this work, Heschel views the 2nd century sages <a href="Rabbi%20Akiva">Rabbi Akiva</a> and <a href="Ishmael%20ben%20Elisha">Ishmael ben Elisha</a> as paradigms for the two dominant world-views in Jewish theology

Two Hebrew volumes were published during his lifetime by <a href="Soncino%20Press">Soncino Press</a>, and the third Hebrew volume was published posthumously by JTS Press in the 1990s. An English translation of all three volumes, with notes, essays and appendices, was translated and edited by Rabbi <a href="Gordon%20Tucker">Gordon Tucker</a>, entitled "Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations". In its own right it can be the subject of intense study and analysis, and provides insight into the relationship between God and Man beyond the world of Judaism and for all Monotheism.

Heschel wrote a series of articles, originally in Hebrew, on the existence of prophecy in Judaism after the destruction of the Holy <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> in 70 CE. These essays were translated into English and published as "Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others" by the American Judaica publisher <a href="KTAV%20Publishing%20House">Ktav</a>.

The publisher of this book states, "The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times. Heschel's work on prophetic inspiration in the Middle Ages originally appeared in two long Hebrew articles. In them he concentrated on the idea that prophetic inspiration was possible even in post-Talmudic times, and, indeed, had taken place at various times and in various schools, from the <a href="Geonim">Geonim</a> to <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> and beyond."

Four schools have been named for Heschel, in the <a href="Upper%20West%20Side">Upper West Side</a> of New York City, <a href="Northridge%2C%20California">Northridge, California</a>, <a href="Agoura%20Hills%2C%20California">Agoura Hills, California</a>, and <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, Canada. In 2009, a highway in Missouri was named "Dr. Abraham Joshua Heschel Highway" after a <a href="Springfield%2C%20Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a> area Neo-Nazi group cleaned the stretch of highway as part of an "Adopt-A-Highway" plan. Heschel's daughter, Susannah, has objected to the adoption of her father's name in this context.

<doc id="2856" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2856" title="Latin American Integration Association">
Latin American Integration Association

The Latin American Integration Association / Asociación Latinoamericana de Integración / Associação Latino-Americana de Integração (LAIA / ALADI) is an international and regional scope organization. It was created on 12 August 1980 by the 1980 Montevideo Treaty, replacing the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA / ALALC). Currently, it has 13 member countries, and any of the Latin American States may apply for accession.

The development of the integration process developed within the framework of the ALADI aims at promoting the harmonious and balanced socio-economic development of the region, and its long-term objective is the gradual and progressive establishment of a Latin-American <a href="Common%20Market">Common Market</a>.



The ALADI promotes the establishment of an area of economic preferences within the region, in order to create a Latin-American common market, through three mechanisms:

The Relatively Less Economically Developed Countries of the region (Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay) benefit from a preferential system, through the lists of markets opening offered by the countries in favor of the Relatively Less Economically Developed Countries; special programs of cooperation (business rounds, pre-investment, financing, technological support); and countervailing measures in favor of the land-locked countries, the full participation of such countries in the integration process is sought.
The ALADI includes in its legal structure the strongest sub-regional, plurilateral and bilateral integration agreements arising in growing numbers in the continent. As a result, the ALADI – as an institutional and legal framework or “umbrella” of the regional integration- develops actions in order to support and foster these efforts for the progressive establishment of a common economic space.

The 1980 Montevideo Treaty is open to the accession of any Latin-American country. 
On 26 August 1999, the first accession to the 1980 Montevideo Treaty was executed, with the incorporation of the Republic of Cuba as a member country of the ALADI. 
On 10 May 2012, the Republic of Panama became the thirteenth member country of the ALADI. 
Likewise, the accession of the Republic of Nicaragua was accepted in the Sixteenth Meeting of the Council of Ministers (Resolution 75 (XVI)), held on 11 August 2011. Currently, Nicaragua moves towards the fulfillment of conditions for becoming a member country of the ALADI.
The ALADI opens its field of actions for the rest of Latin America through multilateral links or partial agreements with other countries and integration areas of the continent (Article 25).
The Latin-American Integration Association also contemplates the horizontal cooperation with other integration movements in the world and partial actions with third developing countries or their respective integration areas (Article 27).

The Council of Ministers is the supreme body of the ALADI, and adopts the decisions for the superior political management of the integration process. 
It is constituted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the member countries. Notwithstanding, when one of such member countries assigns the competence of the integration affairs to a different Minister or Secretary of State, the member countries may be represented, with full powers, by the respective Minister or Secretary. It is convened by the Committee of Representatives, meets and makes decisions with the presence of all the member countries.

It is in charge, among others, of analyzing the functioning of the integration process in all its aspects, promoting the convergence of the partial scope agreements seeking their progressive multilateralization, and promoting greater scope actions as regards economic integration. It is made up of Plenipotentiaries of the member countries.

It is the permanent political body and negotiating forum of the ALADI, where all the initiatives for the fulfillment of the objectives established by the 1980 Montevideo Treaty are analyzed and agreed on. It is composed of a Permanent Representative of each member country with right to one vote and an Alternate Representative. It meets regularly every 15 days and its Resolutions are adopted by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the member countries.

It is the technical body of the ALADI, and it may propose, evaluate, study and manage for the fulfillment of the objectives of the ALADI. It is composed of technical and administrative personnel, and directed by a Secretary-General, who has the support of two Undersecretaries, elected for a three-year period, renewable for the same term.

<doc id="2858" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858" title="Aircraft spotting">
Aircraft spotting

Aircraft spotting or plane spotting is a hobby of tracking the movement of aircraft, which is often accomplished by photography. Besides monitoring aircraft, aircraft spotting enthusiasts (whom are usually called plane spotters) also record information regarding <a href="airports">airports</a>, <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> communications and airline routes.

Aviation enthusiasts have been watching airplanes and other aircraft ever since they were invented. However, plane spotting was not considered a distinct hobby until the second half of the 20th century.

The development of technology and global resources enabled a revolution in spotting. <a href="Point%20and%20shoot%20camera">Point and shoot camera</a>s, <a href="DSLR">DSLR</a>s & <a href="walkie%20talkie">walkie talkie</a>s significantly changed the hobby. With the help of the internet, websites such as <a href="FlightAware">FlightAware</a> and <a href="Flightradar24">Flightradar24</a> have made it possible for spotters to track and locate specific aircraft from all across the world. Websites specifically for aircraft, such as <a href="airliners.net">airliners.net</a>, and <a href="social%20networking">social networking</a> websites, such as Twitter and <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a>, allow spotters to record their sightings and upload their shots or see pictures of aircraft spotted by other people from all over the world.

When spotting aircraft, observers generally notice the key attributes of an aircraft, such as a distinctive noise from its engine or the number of vapour trails it is leaving. Observers assess the size of the aircraft and the number, type and position of its engines. Another distinctive attribute is the position of wings relative to the fuselage and the degree to which they are swept rearwards. The wings may be above the fuselage, below it, or fixed at midpoint. The number of wings indicate whether it is a monoplane, <a href="biplane">biplane</a> or <a href="triplane">triplane</a>. The position of the tailplane relative to the fin(s) and the shape of the fin are other attributes. The configuration of the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> can be distinctive, as well.

Other features include the speed, cockpit placement, colour scheme or special equipment that changes the silhouette of the aircraft. Taken together these traits will enable the identification of an aircraft. If the observer is familiar with the airfield being used by the aircraft and its normal traffic patterns, he or she is more likely to leap quickly to a decision about the aircraft's identity – they may have seen the same type of aircraft from the same angle many times. This is particularly prevalent if the aircraft spotter is spotting commercial aircraft, operated by airlines that have a limited fleet. 
Spotters use equipment such as <a href="ADS-B">ADS-B</a> decoders to track the movements of aircraft. The two most famous devices used are the <a href="AirNav%20Systems%20RadarBox">AirNav Systems RadarBox</a> and Kinetic Avionics SBS series. Both of them read and process the radar data and show the movements on a computer screen. Most of the decoders also allow the exporting of logs from a certain route or airport.

Some spotters will note and compile the markings, a <a href="Military%20aircraft%20insignia">national insignia</a> or <a href="aircraft%20livery">airline livery</a> or logo, a squadron badge or code letters in the case of a military aircraft. Published manuals allow more information to be deduced, such as the delivery date or the manufacturer's construction number. <a href="Camouflage">Camouflage</a> markings differ, depending on the surroundings in which that aircraft is expected to operate.

In general, most spotters attempt to see as many aircraft of a given type, a particular airline, or a particular subset of aircraft such as <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a>s, commercial <a href="airliner">airliner</a>s, military and/or <a href="general%20aviation">general aviation</a> aircraft. Some spotters attempt to see every airframe and are known as "frame spotters." Others are keen to see every registration worn by each aircraft. 
Ancillary activities might include listening-in to <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> transmissions (using <a href="radio%20scanner">radio scanner</a>s, where that is legal), liaising with other "spotters" to clear up uncertainties as to what aircraft have been seen at specific times or in particular places. Several <a href="internet%20mailing%20list">internet mailing list</a> groups have been formed to help communicate aircraft seen at airports, queries and anomalies. These groups can cater to certain regions, certain aircraft types, or may appeal to a wider audience. Many of these groups originated from the original Oxford.vax group which pioneered this type of communication. The result is that information on aircraft movements can be delivered worldwide in a real-time fashion to spotters.

The hobbyist might travel long distances to visit different airports, to see an unusual aircraft, or to view the remains of aircraft withdrawn from use. Some aircraft may be placed in the care of museums (see <a href="Aviation%20archaeology">Aviation archaeology</a>) – or perhaps be cannibalized in order to repair a similar aircraft already preserved.

Aircraft registrations can be found in books, with online resources, or in monthly magazines from enthusiast groups. Most spotters maintained books of different aircraft fleets and would underline or check each aircraft seen. Each year, a revised version of the books would be published and the spotter would need to re-underline every aircraft seen. With the development of commercial aircraft databases spotters were finally able to record their sightings in an electronic database and produce reports that emulated the underlined books.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the subsequent <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> some countries encouraged their citizens to become "plane spotters" in an "observation corps" or similar public body for reasons of public security. Britain had the <a href="Royal%20Observer%20Corps">Royal Observer Corps</a> which operated between 1925 and 1995. A journal called "The Aeroplane Spotter" was published in January 1940. The publication included a glossary that was refined in 2010 and published online.

<a href="Air%20show">Air show</a>s usually draw large numbers of spotters as it is a chance to enter <a href="airfield">airfield</a>s and <a href="air%20base">air base</a>s worldwide that are usually closed to the public and to see displayed aircraft at close range.

The legal repercussions of the hobby were dramatically shown in November 2001 when fourteen aircraft spotters (twelve British, two Dutch) were arrested by <a href="Hellenic%20Police">Greek police</a> after being observed at an open day at the <a href="Greek%20Air%20Force">Greek Air Force</a> base at <a href="Kalamata">Kalamata</a>. They were charged with espionage, and faced a possible 20-year prison sentence if found guilty. After being held for six weeks, they were eventually released on £9,000 bail, and the charges reduced to the <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charge of illegal information collection. Confident of their innocence they returned for their trial in April 2002 and were stunned to be found guilty, with eight of the group sentenced to three years, the rest for one year. At their appeal a year later all were acquitted.

In the wake of the targeting of airports by terrorists, enthusiasts' organisations and police in the UK have cooperated in creating a code of conduct for plane spotters. By asking enthusiasts to contact police if spotters believe they see or hear something suspicious, this is an attempt to allow enthusiasts to continue their hobby while increasing security around airports. Birmingham and Stansted pioneered this approach in Britain and prior to the 2012 London Olympics, <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a> introduced a "Flightwatch" scheme based on the same cooperative principles. These changes are also being made abroad in countries like Australia, where aviation enthusiasts are reporting suspicious or malice actions to police.

The organisation of such groups has now been echoed in parts of North America. For example, the <a href="Bensenville%20Illinois%20Police%20Department">Bensenville Illinois Police Department</a> have sponsored an "Airport Watch" group at the <a href="Chicago%20O%27Hare%20Airport">Chicago O'Hare Airport</a>. Members are issued identification cards and given training to accurately record and report unusual activities around the airport perimeter (members are not permitted airside). Meetings are attended and supported by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>, Chicago Department of Aviation and the <a href="Transportation%20Security%20Administration">TSA</a> who also provide regular training to group members. The Bensenville program was modeled on similar programs in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ottawa and <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>.

In 2009, a similar airport watch group was organized between airport security and local aircraft spotters at <a href="Montr%C3%A9al%E2%80%93Pierre%20Elliott%20Trudeau%20International%20Airport">Montreal-Pierre Trudeau International Airport</a>. As of 2016, the group has 46 members and a special phone number to use to contact police if suspicious activity is seen around the airport area.

Following the events of <a href="September%2011%20attacks">9/11</a>, information collected by planespotters helped uncover what is known as "<a href="extraordinary%20rendition%20by%20the%20United%20States">extraordinary rendition</a>" by the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>. Information on unusual movements of <a href="rendition%20aircraft">rendition aircraft</a> provided data which led first to news reports and then to a number of governmental and inter-governmental investigations.

Advertising

Advertising is an audio or visual form of <a href="marketing">marketing</a> <a href="communication">communication</a> that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to <a href="promotion%20%28marketing%29">promote</a> or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their <a href="product%20%28business%29">products</a> or <a href="service%20%28economics%29">services</a>. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual.
Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including <a href="old%20media">old media</a> such as newspapers, magazines, <a href="television%20advertisement">Television</a>, <a href="radio%20advertisement">Radio</a>, <a href="outdoor%20advertising">outdoor advertising</a> or <a href="direct%20mail">direct mail</a>; or <a href="new%20media">new media</a> such as <a href="Online%20advertising%23Search%20ads">search results</a>, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or "ad".

Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "branding," which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct response advertising. <a href="Non-commercial">Non-commercial</a> advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of <a href="persuasion">persuasion</a>, such as a <a href="public%20service%20announcement">public service announcement</a>. Advertising may also be used to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.

Modern advertising was created with the techniques introduced with <a href="tobacco%20advertising">tobacco advertising</a> in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of <a href="Edward%20Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>, considered the founder of modern, "<a href="Madison%20Avenue">Madison Avenue</a>" advertising.

In 2015, the world spent an estimate of on advertising. Its projected distribution for 2017 is 40.4% on TV, 33.3% on digital, 9% on newspapers, 6.9% on magazines, 5.8% on outdoor and 4.3% on radio. Internationally, the largest ("big four") advertising conglomerates are <a href="Interpublic">Interpublic</a>, <a href="Omnicom">Omnicom</a>, <a href="Publicis">Publicis</a>, and <a href="WPP%20Group">WPP</a>.

In Latin, "ad vertere" means "to turn toward".

Egyptians used <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a> to make sales messages and wall posters. <a href="Advertising%20campaign">Commercial messages</a> and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a> and ancient <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabia</a>. <a href="Lost%20and%20found">Lost and found</a> advertising on papyrus was common in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> and <a href="ancient%20Rome">ancient Rome</a>. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian <a href="rock%20art">rock art</a> paintings that date back to 4000 BC.

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the <a href="Classic%20of%20Poetry">Classic of Poetry</a> (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell candy. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "<a href="Jinan">Jinan</a> Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high-quality steel rods and make fine-quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> began to grow, and the general population was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith", images associated with their trade would be used such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horse shoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers (<a href="town%20crier">town crier</a>s) to announce their whereabouts for the convenience of the customers. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in "Les Crieries de Paris", a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.

In the 18th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after as disease ravaged Europe. However, <a href="false%20advertising">false advertising</a> and so-called "<a href="Quackery">quack</a>" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.

<a href="Thomas%20J.%20Barratt">Thomas J. Barratt</a> from London has been called "the father of modern advertising". Working for the <a href="Pears%20Soap">Pears Soap</a> company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."

As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.

In June 1836, French newspaper "<a href="La%20Presse%20%28France%29">La Presse</a>" was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its <a href="Profit%20%28economics%29">profitability</a> and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, <a href="Volney%20B.%20Palmer">Volney B. Palmer</a> established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed in the late 19th century when the advertising agency of N.W. Ayer & Son was founded. Ayer and Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products. In order to profit from this higher rate of production, industry needed to recruit workers as consumers of factory products. It did so through the invention of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale. In the 1910s and 1920s, advertisers in the U.S. adopted the doctrine that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "<a href="sublimation%20%28psychology%29">sublimated</a>" into the desire to purchase commodities. <a href="Edward%20Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>, a nephew of <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, became associated with the method and is sometimes called the founder of modern advertising and public relations. Bernays claimed that:"[The] general principle, that men are very largely actuated by motives which they conceal from themselves, is as true of mass as of individual psychology. It is evident that the successful propagandist must understand the true motives and not be content to accept the reasons which men give for what they do."In other words, selling products by appealing to the rational minds of customers (the main method used prior to Bernays) was much less effective than selling products based on the un-conscious desires that Bernays felt were the true motivators of human action.

In the 1920s, under <a href="Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life." In October 1929, the head of the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Foreign%20and%20Domestic%20Commerce">Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce</a>, Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity." This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.

The tobacco companies became major advertisers in order to sell packaged cigarettes. The tobacco companies pioneered the new advertising techniques when they hired Bernays to create positive associations with tobacco smoking.

Advertising was also used as a vehicle for <a href="cultural%20assimilation">cultural assimilation</a>, encouraging workers to exchange their traditional habits and community structure in favor of a shared "modern" lifestyle. An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Foreign%20Language%20Newspapers">American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers</a> (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.
At the turn of the 20th century, there were few career choices for women in business; however, advertising was one of the few. Since women were responsible for most of the purchasing done in their household, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. In fact, the first American advertising to use a <a href="Sex%20in%20advertising">sexual sell</a> was created by a woman – for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement featured a couple with the message "A skin you love to touch".

In the 1920s psychologists Walter D. Scott and <a href="John%20B.%20Watson">John B. Watson</a> contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible". He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer.

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers and retailers who offered programs in order to sell more radios to consumers. As time passed, many <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a>s followed suit in setting up their own radio stations, and included: schools, clubs and civic groups.

When the practice of sponsoring programs was popularized, each individual radio program was usually sponsored by a single business in exchange for a brief mention of the business' name at the beginning and end of the sponsored shows. However, radio station owners soon realized they could earn more money by selling sponsorship rights in small time allocations to multiple businesses throughout their radio station's broadcasts, rather than selling the sponsorship rights to single businesses per show.

In the early 1950s, the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont Television Network</a> began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as <a href="The%20United%20States%20Steel%20Hour">The United States Steel Hour</a>. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show – up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show. The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the <a href="Hallmark%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hallmark Hall of Fame</a>.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in "for" the advertising message, rather than it being a <a href="by-product">by-product</a> or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, <a href="specialty%20channel">specialty channel</a>s emerged, including channels entirely <a href="Shopping%20channel">devoted to advertising</a>, such as <a href="QVC">QVC</a>, <a href="Home%20Shopping%20Network">Home Shopping Network</a>, and <a href="ShopTV%20Canada">ShopTV Canada</a>. 

With the advent of the <a href="ad%20server">ad server</a>, online advertising grew, contributing to the "<a href="dot-com%20bubble">dot-com</a>" boom of the 1990s. Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from <a href="coupon">coupon</a>s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, some websites, including the <a href="Web%20search%20engine">search engine</a> <a href="Google">Google</a>, changed <a href="online%20advertising">online advertising</a> by personalizing ads based on web browsing behavior. This has led to other similar efforts and an increase in <a href="interactive%20advertising">interactive advertising</a>.

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media since 1925. In 1925, the main advertising media in America were newspapers, magazines, signs on <a href="Tram">streetcars</a>, and outdoor <a href="poster">poster</a>s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media. Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.

<a href="Guerrilla%20marketing">Guerrilla marketing</a> involves unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message. This type of advertising is unpredictable, which causes consumers to buy the product or idea. This reflects an increasing trend of interactive and "embedded" ads, such as via <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a>, having consumers vote through text messages, and various campaigns utilizing <a href="social%20network%20service">social network service</a>s such as <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> or <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>.

The advertising business model has also been adapted in recent years. In <a href="media%20for%20equity">media for equity</a>, advertising is not sold, but provided to start-up companies in return for <a href="equity%20%28finance%29">equity</a>. If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Domain name registrants (usually those who register and renew domains as an investment) sometimes <a href="domain%20parking">"park" their domains</a> and allow advertising companies to place ads on their sites in return for per-click payments. These ads are typically driven by pay per click search engines like Google or Yahoo, but ads can sometimes be placed directly on targeted domain names through a domain lease or by making contact with the registrant of a domain name that describes a product. Domain name registrants are generally easy to identify through <a href="WHOIS">WHOIS</a> records that are publicly available at registrar websites.

Advertising may be categorized in a variety of ways, including by style, target audience, geographic scope, medium, or purpose. For example, in print advertising, classification by style can include display advertising (ads with design elements sold by size) vs. classified advertising (ads without design elements sold by the word or line). Advertising may be local, national or global. An ad campaign may be directed toward consumers or to businesses. The purpose of an ad may be to raise awareness (brand advertising), or to elicit an immediate sale (direct response advertising).

Virtually any medium can be used for advertising. Commercial advertising media can include <a href="Mural">wall paintings</a>, <a href="billboards">billboards</a>, <a href="street%20furniture">street furniture</a> components, printed flyers and <a href="rack%20card">rack card</a>s, radio, cinema and television adverts, <a href="web%20banner">web banner</a>s, mobile telephone screens, shopping carts, web <a href="Pop-up%20ad">popups</a>, <a href="skywriting">skywriting</a>, bus stop benches, <a href="human%20billboard">human billboard</a>s and <a href="forehead%20advertising">forehead advertising</a>, magazines, newspapers, town criers, sides of buses, banners attached to or sides of airplanes ("<a href="logojet">logojet</a>s"), <a href="In-flight%20advertising">in-flight advertisements</a> on <a href="Tray-table">seatback tray tables</a> or overhead storage bins, taxicab doors, roof mounts and <a href="cabvision">passenger screens</a>, musical stage shows, subway platforms and trains, elastic bands on disposable diapers, doors of bathroom stalls, stickers on apples in supermarkets, <a href="Shopping%20cart">shopping cart handles</a> (grabertising), the opening section of <a href="Streaming%20media">streaming</a> audio and video, posters, and the backs of event tickets and supermarket receipts. Any place an "identified" sponsor pays to deliver their message through a medium is advertising.










Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward the usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like <a href="digital%20video%20recorders">digital video recorders</a> (DVRs) such as <a href="TiVo">TiVo</a>.

Online advertising began with unsolicited bulk e-mail advertising known as "<a href="e-mail%20spam">e-mail spam</a>". Spam has been a problem for e-mail users since 1978. As new online communication channels became available, advertising followed. The first banner ad appeared on the World Wide Web in 1994. Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.

In online display advertising, display ads generate awareness quickly. Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it's used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear 'call to action'.

As the mobile phone became a new mass medium in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland, <a href="mobile%20advertising">mobile advertising</a> followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000. By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2 billion and providers such as <a href="Admob">Admob</a> delivered billions of mobile ads.

More advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, <a href="Multimedia%20Messaging%20Service">Multimedia Messaging Service</a> picture and video messages, advergames and various <a href="engagement%20marketing">engagement marketing</a> campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the <a href="2D%20barcode">2D barcode</a>, which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.

Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate logos on the side of booster <a href="rocket">rocket</a>s and the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can include personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, "<a href="Xerox">Xerox</a>" = "<a href="photocopier">photocopier</a>", "<a href="Kleenex">Kleenex</a>" = <a href="Facial%20tissue">tissue</a>, "<a href="Vaseline">Vaseline</a>" = <a href="petroleum%20jelly">petroleum jelly</a>, "<a href="The%20Hoover%20Company">Hoover</a>" = <a href="vacuum%20cleaner">vacuum cleaner</a>, and "<a href="Band-Aid">Band-Aid</a>" = <a href="adhesive%20bandage">adhesive bandage</a>). However, some companies oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a <a href="generic%20trademark">generic trademark</a> – turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a trademark is lost. 

From time to time, <a href="The%20CW%20Television%20Network">The CW Television Network</a> airs short programming breaks called "Content Wraps", to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered "content wraps" and some products featured were <a href="Herbal%20Essences">Herbal Essences</a>, <a href="Crest%20%28toothpaste%29">Crest</a>, <a href="Guitar%20Hero%20II">Guitar Hero II</a>, <a href="CoverGirl">CoverGirl</a>, and recently <a href="Toyota">Toyota</a>.

A new promotion concept has appeared, "ARvertising", advertising on <a href="Augmented%20Reality">Augmented Reality</a> technology.

Controversy exists on the effectiveness of <a href="subliminal%20message">subliminal advertising</a> (see <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a>), and the pervasiveness of mass messages (<a href="Propaganda">Propaganda</a>).

With the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Popup, <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a>, banner, Popunder, <a href="advergaming">advergaming</a>, and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend. In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three-quarters of 2009 mobile and internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively. Older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers).

Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the <a href="niche%20market">niche market</a> using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the <a href="long%20tail">long tail</a>, advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest <a href="mass%20market">mass market</a> audience possible. However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined, leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, <a href="Comcast%20Spotlight">Comcast Spotlight</a> is one such advertiser employing this method in their <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.

<a href="Google%20AdSense">Google AdSense</a> is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses key words on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.

The concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of <a href="user-generated">user-generated</a> advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of <a href="PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a> held the "Crash the Super Bowl" contest, allowing people to create their own <a href="Doritos">Doritos</a> commercial. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs. Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the <a href="USA%20Today%20Super%20Bowl%20Ad%20Meter">USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter</a> as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about". Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company <a href="Jones%20Soda">Jones Soda</a> that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.

This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, <a href="Zooppa">Zooppa</a> has launched ad competitions for brands such as Google, <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, <a href="The%20Hershey%20Company">Hershey's</a>, <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a>, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="NBC%20Universal">NBC Universal</a>, <a href="Zinio">Zinio</a>, and <a href="Mini%20Cooper">Mini Cooper</a>. Crowdsourced remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear.

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For <a href="Global%20marketing">global advertisers</a>, there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a> in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.

Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a> are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. <a href="Market%20research">Market research</a> measures, such as , and provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.

Foreign governments, particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's <a href="Perception%20management">desired international public perception</a>. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates airline</a> (<a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>), <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> (Singapore), <a href="Qatar%20Airways">Qatar Airways</a> (<a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>), <a href="China%20Airlines">China Airlines</a> (<a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>/<a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a>), and <a href="Air%20China">Air China</a> (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.

In the realm of <a href="advertising%20agencies">advertising agencies</a>, continued industry diversification has seen observers note that "big global clients don't need big global agencies any more". This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business <a href="TAXI%20%28advertising%20agency%29">TAXI</a> and <a href="SMART%20%28advertising%20agency%29">SMART</a> in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world".

The ability to record shows on <a href="digital%20video%20recorder">digital video recorder</a>s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded <a href="box%20set">box set</a>s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are sold, means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.

To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like <a href="Survivor%20%28TV%20series%29">Survivor</a>. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected <a href="EPG">EPG</a>s, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating <a href="TV%20apps">TV apps</a>. Additionally, some like brands have opted for <a href="social%20television">social television</a> sponsorship.

<a href="Advertising%20education">Advertising education</a> has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis. A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking. A unique model for teaching advertising is the <a href="student-run%20advertising%20agency">student-run advertising agency</a>, where advertising students create campaigns for real companies. Organizations such as the <a href="American%20Advertising%20Federation">American Advertising Federation</a> establish companies with students to create these campaigns.

Advertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.

Sales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are, and to jump start sales. Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.

One way to create brand loyalty is to reward consumers for spending time interacting with the brand. This method may come in many forms like rewards card, rewards programs and sampling.

While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth, it is not without social costs. <a href="E-mail%20spam">Unsolicited commercial e-mail</a> and other forms of <a href="Spam%20%28electronic%29">spam</a> have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on <a href="internet%20service%20provider">internet service provider</a>s. Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.

One of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar, fat, and salt specifically to children. Critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices. Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable. Michelle Obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines. The other criticisms include the change that are brought by those advertisements on the society and also the deceiving ads that are aired and published by the corporations. <a href="cosmetic%20industry">Cosmetic</a> and <a href="health%20industry">health industry</a> are the ones which exploited the highest and created reasons of concern.

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples include restrictions for advertising <a href="alcohol%20advertising">alcohol</a>, <a href="tobacco%20advertising">tobacco</a> or <a href="gambling">gambling</a> imposed in many countries, as well as the bans around <a href="advertising%20to%20children">advertising to children</a>, which exist in parts of Europe. Advertising regulation focuses heavily on the <a href="false%20advertising">veracity</a> of the claims and as such, there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products.

The advertising industries within some countries rely less on laws and more on systems of self-regulation. Advertisers and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the <a href="Advertising%20Standards%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Advertising Standards Authority</a> in the UK.

In the UK, most forms of <a href="outdoor%20advertising">outdoor advertising</a> such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently, the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offense. In the US, many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm. As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside. Cities such as <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a> have introduced an outright ban with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.

Some governments restrict the languages that can be used in advertisements, but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them. In France for instance, advertisers sometimes print English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with Article 120 of the 1994 <a href="Toubon%20Law">Toubon Law</a> limiting the use of English).

The advertising of pricing information is another topic of concern for governments. In the United States for instance, it is common for businesses to only mention the existence and amount of applicable taxes at a later stage of a transaction. In Canada and New Zealand, taxes can be listed as separate items, as long as they are quoted up-front. In most other countries, the advertised price must include all applicable taxes, enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them.

Various competing models of hierarchies of effects attempt to provide a theoretical underpinning to advertising practice.

The <a href="marketing%20mix">marketing mix</a> was proposed by professor <a href="E.%20Jerome%20McCarthy">E. Jerome McCarthy</a> in the 1960s. It consists of four basic elements called the "four Ps". Product is the first P representing the actual product. Price represents the process of determining the value of a product. Place represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. The last P stands for Promotion which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to buy the product.

In the 1990s, the concept of four Cs was introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of four P's. There are two theories based on four Cs: Lauterborn's four Cs ("consumer", "cost", "communication", "convenience")

Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising. It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as <a href="copy%20testing">copy testing</a>) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.

Pre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.

Post-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.

Continuous <a href="ad%20tracking">ad tracking</a> and the <a href="Communicus">Communicus</a> System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.

Meanings between consumers and marketers depict <a href="signage">signs</a> and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects. <a href="Semiotics">Semiotics</a> is the study of signs and how they are interpreted. Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within <a href="brand%20names">brand names</a>, <a href="logos">logos</a>, package designs, print advertisements, and <a href="television%20advertisements">television advertisements</a>. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels – known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product. These signs can be images, words, fonts, <a href="color">color</a>s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, <a href="color">color</a>s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer. The "key to advertising analysis" is the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept. A product has a signifier and a signified. The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.

<a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple's</a> commercials used a black <a href="silhouette">silhouette</a> of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.

The semiotics of <a href="gender">gender</a> plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering <a href="Gender%20advertisement">gender roles in advertising</a>, individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as <a href="feminine">feminine</a> or <a href="masculine">masculine</a>). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect <a href="attention">attention</a> and elaboration of the message (<a href="tradition">tradition</a>al or non-traditional <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a> orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.

There are two types of <a href="marketing%20communication">marketing communication</a> claims-objective and subjective. Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature. For instance, a camera may have auto-focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service. They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical reality. For instance the <a href="brochure">brochure</a> has a beautiful design. <a href="Male">Male</a>s tend to respond better to objective marketing-communications claims while <a href="female">female</a>s tend to respond better to subjective <a href="marketing%20communications">marketing communications</a> claims.

<a href="Voiceover">Voiceover</a>s are commonly used in advertising. Most voiceovers are done by men, with figures of up to 94% having been reported. There have been more female voiceovers in recent years, but mainly for food, household products, and feminine-care products.

According to a 1977 study by David Statt, females process information comprehensively, while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures, methods or strategies for solving <a href="problem">problem</a>s, which could have an effect on how they interpret advertising. According to this study, men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message, whereas females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation. Later research by a Danish team found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at <a href="transformation%20%28disambiguation%29">transformation</a> toward an impossible ideal of female presentation.In Paul Suggett's article "The Objectification of Women in Advertising" he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women in real life. And gives men and young men a skewed and unrealistic expectation of women. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances.These advertisements are directed towards men Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized. There are some companies however like <a href="Dove%20Beauties">Dove</a> and <a href="Aerie%20%28American%20Eagle%20Outfitters%29">Aerie</a> that are creating commercials to portray more natural women that are less photo shopped so more women and young girls are able to relate to them. These commercials give more natural beauty standards.

More recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state. Susan Wojcicki, author of the article "Ads that Empower Women don’t just Break Stereotypes—They’re also Effective" discusses how advertising to women has changed since the first <a href="Barbie">Barbie</a> commercial where a little girl tells the doll that, she wants to be just like her. Little girls grow up watching advertisements of scantily clad women advertising things from trucks to burgers and Wojcicki states it shows girls that they're either arm candy or eye candy. But in recent studies, ads that are shown empowering women such as the #Like A Girl ad campaign by <a href="Always%20%28brand%29">Always</a> have a better effect on women. When women see women being empowered on these ads, they're more likely to watch and share the videos. The views of these ads on sites like <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> doubled and are more likely to be watched and shared by women.

AI-complete

In the field of <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or <a href="artificial%20general%20intelligence">strong AI</a>. To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm. 

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include <a href="computer%20vision">computer vision</a>, <a href="natural%20language%20understanding">natural language understanding</a>, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.

Currently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone, but would also require <a href="human%20computation">human computation</a>. This property can be useful, for instance to test for the presence of humans as with <a href="CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>s, and for <a href="computer%20security">computer security</a> to circumvent <a href="brute-force%20attack">brute-force attack</a>s.

The term was coined by <a href="Fanya%20Montalvo">Fanya Montalvo</a> by analogy with <a href="NP-complete">NP-complete</a> and <a href="NP-hard">NP-hard</a> in <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">complexity theory</a>, which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems. Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation and in <a href="Eric%20S.%20Raymond">Eric Raymond</a>'s 1991 <a href="Jargon%20File">Jargon File</a>.

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include:

To translate accurately, a machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to <a href="artificial%20intelligence%23Deduction%2C%20reasoning%2C%20problem%20solving">reason</a>. It must have extensive <a href="commonsense%20knowledge">world knowledge</a> so that it knows what is being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one "feel" to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including <a href="artificial%20intelligence%23Deduction%2C%20reasoning%2C%20problem%20solving">reason</a>, <a href="commonsense%20knowledge">commonsense knowledge</a> and the intuitions that underlie <a href="robotics">motion and manipulation</a>, <a href="machine%20perception">perception</a>, and <a href="artificial%20intelligence%23Social%20intelligence">social intelligence</a>. <a href="Machine%20translation">Machine translation</a>, therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.

Current AI systems can solve very simple and/or restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to "scale up" their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively <a href="brittle%20%28software%29">brittle</a> without <a href="commonsense%20knowledge">commonsense knowledge</a> or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear. When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without strong AI has no other skills to fall back on.

<a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">Computational complexity theory</a> deals with the relative computational difficulty of <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a>s. By definition it does not cover problems whose solution is unknown or has not been characterised formally. Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed. It is based on a <a href="model%20of%20computation">model of computation</a> that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human. This is formalised by a human-assisted <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>. The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allows <a href="equivalence%20class">equivalence class</a>es to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine is given by a pair formula_1, where the first element represents the complexity of the human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing machine is:

<doc id="2864" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2864" title="Archaeoastronomy">
Archaeoastronomy

Archaeoastronomy (also spelled archeoastronomy) is the study of how people in the past "have understood the <a href="phenomenon">phenomena</a> in the <a href="sky">sky</a>, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their <a href="culture">culture</a>s." <a href="Clive%20Ruggles">Clive Ruggles</a> argues it is misleading to consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with "ethnoastronomy", the <a href="anthropology">anthropological</a> study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with <a href="historical%20astronomy">historical astronomy</a>, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the <a href="history%20of%20astronomy">history of astronomy</a>, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.

Archaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in <a href="landscape%20archaeology">landscape archaeology</a> and <a href="cognitive%20archaeology">cognitive archaeology</a>. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into <a href="Paganism">beliefs about the cycles of nature</a>, such as <a href="Maya%20civilization%23Astronomy">Mayan astronomy</a> and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.

Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs. It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as: ""...[A] field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other.""

Two hundred years before Michell wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no <a href="Archaeology%23History%20of%20archaeology">professional archaeologists</a>, but there were astronomers and <a href="Antiquarianism">antiquarians</a>. Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as <a href="William%20Stukeley">William Stukeley</a> did of <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> in 1740, while <a href="John%20Aubrey">John Aubrey</a> in 1678 and <a href="Henry%20Chauncy">Henry Chauncy</a> in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches. Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as <a href="Richard%20Proctor">Richard Proctor</a> and <a href="Charles%20Piazzi%20Smyth">Charles Piazzi Smyth</a> investigated the astronomical orientations of <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">the pyramids</a>.

The term "archaeoastronomy" was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973, but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles says that <a href="Heinrich%20Nissen">Heinrich Nissen</a>, working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair says that <a href="Norman%20Lockyer">Norman Lockyer</a>, working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy.' Euan MacKie would place the origin even later, stating: "...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of <a href="Alexander%20Thom">Alexander Thom</a> in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s."
In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer <a href="Gerald%20Hawkins">Gerald Hawkins</a>, who proposed that <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> was a <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> computer, inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed, but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of <a href="megalith">megalith</a>ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles. Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a> site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon <a href="stone%20circle">stone circle</a> in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain. In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Krupp wrote in 1979, "Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades." His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.

The approach in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in <a href="Amerindian">Amerindian</a> civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a> of Europe lacks such as <a href="ethnography">ethnographies</a> and the historical records of the early <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">colonizers</a>. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.

This came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.

Archaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures. As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), <a href="history%20of%20astronomy">history of astronomy</a> (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).

Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.

Both practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by <a href="cultural%20anthropology">cultural anthropology</a> and aimed at understanding a "group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology. Todd Bostwick argued that "archaeoastronomy is anthropology – the study of human behavior in the past and present." <a href="Paul%20Bahn">Paul Bahn</a> has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology. Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques. Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing "the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism" Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable <a href="Precursorism">precursors</a> of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.

The reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers. Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.

Since archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term "Astronomy in Culture" or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline "Archaeotopography." Ruggles and Saunders proposed "Cultural Astronomy" as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are <a href="cosmology">cosmologies</a> and people who object to the use of <a href="logos">logos</a> have suggested adopting the Spanish "cosmovisión".

When debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (<a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown (<a href="New%20World">New World</a>) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.

There is no one way to do Archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.

Green Archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book "Archaeoastronomy in the Old World". It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.

Thom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a '<a href="double%20sunset">double sunset</a>'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a <a href="hypothetical">hypothetical</a> site, one the day before the <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a> and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.

To test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two <a href="solstice">solstice</a>s, the two <a href="equinox">equinox</a>es and four <a href="cross-quarter%20day">cross-quarter day</a>s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.

Euan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing <a href="Neolithic%20Britain">Neolithic Britain</a> to the <a href="Mayan%20civilization">Mayan civilization</a> to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. <a href="Kintraw">Kintraw</a> is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on <a href="Jura%2C%20Scotland">Jura</a>. This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at <a href="Maes%20Howe">Maes Howe</a> and on the <a href="Bush%20Barrow">Bush Barrow</a> Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.

In contrast <a href="Clive%20Ruggles">Clive Ruggles</a> has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys. Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in <a href="Atmospheric%20refraction">refraction</a> near the horizon. A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer "whether" there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer "why" people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: "To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn’t inform the current interpretive questions." Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.

In contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the <a href="history%20of%20astronomy">history of astronomy</a> or to <a href="cultural%20history">cultural history</a>, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.

One famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is <a href="Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</a>. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a>ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet <a href="Venus">Venus</a>. This interest is attested to by the <a href="Dresden%20codex">Dresden codex</a> which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with <a href="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> or <a href="Xolotl">Xolotl</a>. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza.

The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful. Aveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the <a href="Caracol">Caracol</a>. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.

Aveni states that one of the strengths of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the <a href="Inca">Inca</a>s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using "ceques" radial routes emanating from the capital at <a href="Cusco">Cusco</a>. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a>, in the second century BC.

A criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like <a href="analogy">analogy</a> and <a href="homology%20%28anthropology%29">homology</a> and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy.

Because archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices.

A common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments. This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.

An alignment is calculated by measuring the <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a>, the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The azimuth is usually measured using a <a href="theodolite">theodolite</a> or a <a href="compass">compass</a>. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its <a href="magnetic%20declination">magnetic declination</a> must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.

A theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be <a href="calibration">calibrated</a> using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a <a href="clinometer">clinometer</a>.

For artifacts such as the <a href="Nebra%20skydisk">Sky Disc of Nebra</a>, alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis would be similar to typical <a href="Archaeology%23Post-excavation%20analysis">post-excavation analysis</a> as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.

A more mundane example is the presence of <a href="astrological%20symbol">astrological symbol</a>s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.

Another well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the <a href="Antikythera%20mechanism">Antikythera mechanism</a>. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.

Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from <a href="Itanos%20%28city%29">Itanos</a>) has been translated as:"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off ‘the little pig’ and the stele the sun turns." From Mesoamerica come <a href="Maya%20codices">Mayan</a> and <a href="Aztec%20codices">Aztec codices</a>. These are folding books made from <a href="Amatl">Amatl</a>, processed tree bark on which are <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s in <a href="Maya%20script">Mayan</a> or <a href="Aztec%20script">Aztec script</a>. The <a href="Dresden%20codex">Dresden codex</a> contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.

More problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of <a href="Fajada%20Butte">Fajada Butte</a> at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor <a href="lunar%20standstill">lunar standstill</a>s of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.

If no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.

As well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the <a href="Conquistadores">Conquistadores</a> are a rich source of information about the pre-Columbian Americans. <a href="Ethnography">Ethnographers</a> also provide material about many other peoples.

Aveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the sun passes overhead found at places like <a href="Monte%20Alb%C3%A1n">Monte Albán</a> and <a href="Xochicalco">Xochicalco</a>. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society. Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites. However, it has been shown that, since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena, they likely have different explanations.

Ethnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At a site in <a href="Chaco%20Canyon">Chaco Canyon</a> can be found a <a href="pictograph">pictograph</a> with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the <a href="SN%201054">1054 Supernova</a>. However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The <a href="Zuni%20people">Zuni people</a>, who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.

Ethnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example, anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their <a href="Aboriginal%20astronomy">Indigenous astronomies</a> and about their interaction with the modern world.

Once the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.

To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as "declination". The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.

While the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a <a href="pendulum">pendulum</a>, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice. For more information see <a href="History%20of%20solar%20observation">History of solar observation</a>.

The Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as <a href="Lunar%20standstill">"luni"stices</a> rather than "sol"stices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a <a href="Sidereal%20month%23Sidereal%20month">sidereal month</a> to complete its cycle rather than the year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on <a href="Lunar%20standstill">an 18.6 year cycle</a>. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the "<a href="Lunar%20phase">phase</a>" of the Moon. The cycle from one <a href="New%20Moon">New Moon</a> to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the <a href="Synodic%20month">Synodic month</a>. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See <a href="Moon">Moon</a> for more details.

Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a <a href="spinning%20top">spinning top</a>. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a> as they do now. In the case of the <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">Egyptian pyramids</a>, it has been shown they were aligned towards <a href="Thuban">Thuban</a>, a faint star in the constellation of <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco</a>. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation <a href="Capricornus">Capricorn</a>. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in <a href="Sagittarius%20%28constellation%29">Sagittarius</a> due to the <a href="precession%20of%20the%20equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>.

Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s. In the case of <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> enables us to date a battle between the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> and the <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.

Some <a href="comet">comet</a>s are predictable, most famously <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a>s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> once and so are inherently unpredictable.

<a href="Meteor%20shower">Meteor shower</a>s should be predictable, but some <a href="meteor">meteor</a>s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete. Other events noted by ancients include <a href="Aurora%20%28astronomy%29">aurorae</a>, <a href="sun%20dog">sun dog</a>s and <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a>s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.

A common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate <a href="calendar">calendar</a> for <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a> reasons. Ancient texts like <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with <a href="ecology">ecological</a> signs, such as <a href="bird%20migration">bird migration</a>s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the <a href="Mursi%20people">Mursi</a> of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times in some parts of the world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.

An example of a non-agricultural calendar is the "<a href="Tzolk%27in">Tzolk'in</a>" calendar of the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> of <a href="pre-Columbian">pre-Columbian</a> <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an <a href="260-day%20Mesoamerican%20calendar">earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica</a>. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of <a href="Maya%20calendar">Maya calendar</a>s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.

Other peculiar calendars include ancient <a href="Hellenic%20calendar">Greek calendars</a>. These were nominally <a href="Lunar%20calendar">lunar</a>, starting with the <a href="New%20Moon">New Moon</a>. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and "ton theoi", by the <a href="moon">moon</a>. The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as <a href="Panhellenic%20Games">games</a> or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping. Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.

Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the <a href="universe">universe</a>. In these cultures <a href="mythology">myth</a> was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern <a href="science">science</a>, are <a href="cosmology">cosmologies</a>.

The <a href="Inca">Inca</a>s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, <a href="Cusco">Cusco</a>, was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four "suyus", which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> in the night sky. In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> fashion.

The importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The <a href="Forbidden%20City">Forbidden City</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: <a href="North">North</a>, <a href="South">South</a>, <a href="East">East</a>, <a href="West">West</a> and <a href="Centre%20%28geometry%29">Centre</a>. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing. One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the <a href="Circumpolar%20constellation">circumpolar stars</a>. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as <a href="feng%20shui">feng shui</a>.

There is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s. The Barasana of the <a href="Amazon%20Rainforest">Amazon</a> plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.

A more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.

The loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.

<a href="Giorgio%20de%20Santillana">Giorgio de Santillana</a>, professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book "Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time" (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the <a href="precession%20of%20the%20equinoxes">precession of the equinoxes</a>. Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.

By including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> described by <a href="Homer">Homer</a> is also a catalogue of constellations. In North America shields depicted in <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a> <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s appear to include Venus symbolism.

<a href="Solstice">Solsticial</a> alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the <a href="Isla%20del%20Sol">Island of the Sun</a> (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in <a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a>, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the <a href="Inca">Inca</a> ruling elite. Ordinary <a href="Pilgrimage">pilgrims</a> stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.

In Egypt the temple of <a href="Amun-Re">Amun-Re</a> at <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a> has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the <a href="obliquity%20of%20the%20ecliptic">obliquity of the ecliptic</a> show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun. The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.

In a later period the <a href="Serapeum">Serapeum</a> in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was also said to have contained a <a href="Sun">solar</a> alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a> thus symbolising the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> saluting the god.

<a href="Clive%20Ruggles">Clive Ruggles</a> and <a href="Michel%20Cotte">Michel Cotte</a> recently edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy that provides a list of the main sites around the world.

Newgrange is a passage tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3,300 to 2,900 BC For a few days around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central passageway into the heart of the tomb. What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly. It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind. Clive Ruggles notes:

Since the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a>, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in <a href="Ursa%20Major">the Plough / Big Dipper</a> which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a <a href="plumb%20bob">plumb bob</a> was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.

Some have argued that the pyramids were laid out as <a href="Orion%20correlation%20theory">a map of the three stars</a> in the belt of Orion, although this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.

The <a href="Astronomical%20ceiling%20of%20Senemut%20Tomb">astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut</a> (BC) contains the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations in the form of discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.

El Castillo, also known as Kukulcán's Pyramid, is a <a href="Mesoamerican%20pyramids">Mesoamerican step-pyramid</a> built in the centre of <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a>n center of <a href="Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</a> in Mexico. Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).
A visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs on the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season.

Many astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of <a href="megalith">megalith</a>s and <a href="Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">earthwork</a>s in the <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a> of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.

As well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.

This is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the Mainland of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> – probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island <a href="Hoy">Hoy</a>, about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy. Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of <a href="Samhain">Samhain</a> and <a href="Imbolc">Imbolc</a>. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines. Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.

Uxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a> of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius "et cetera"? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.

In Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer. Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon. Subsequent research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions. In addition, research shows that the Great North Road, a thirty-five mile engineered “road”, was constructed not for utilitarian purposes but rather to connect the ceremonial center of Chaco Canyon with the direction north.

In recent years, new research has suggested that the <a href="Lascaux">Lascaux</a> cave paintings in France may incorporate prehistoric star charts. Michael Rappenglueck of the <a href="University%20of%20Munich">University of Munich</a> argues that some of the non-figurative dot clusters and dots within some of the figurative images correlate with the constellations of <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>, the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> and the grouping known as the "<a href="Summer%20Triangle">Summer Triangle</a>". Based on her own study of the astronomical significance of Bronze Age <a href="petroglyphs">petroglyphs</a> in the <a href="Vall%C3%A9e%20des%20Merveilles">Vallée des Merveilles</a> and her extensive survey of other prehistoric cave painting sites in the region—most of which appear to have been selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter solstice</a>—French researcher Chantal Jègues-Wolkiewiez has further proposed that the gallery of figurative images in the Great Hall represents an extensive star map and that key points on major figures in the group correspond to stars in the main <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s as they appeared in the Paleolithic. Appliying phylogenetics to myths of the Cosmic Hunt, Julien d'Huy suggested that the palaeolithic version of this story could be the following: there is an animal that is a horned herbivore, especially an elk. One human pursues this ungulate. The hunt locates or gets to the sky. The animal is alive when it is transformed into a constellation. It forms the Big Dipper. This story may be represented in the famous Lascaux shaft ‘scene’ 

Archaeoastronomy owes something of this poor reputation among scholars to its occasional misuse to advance a range of <a href="Pseudohistory">pseudo-historical</a> accounts. During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled "Germanische Himmelskunde", or "Teutonic Skylore". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near East</a> in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the "<a href="Aryan%20race">Aryans</a>" (Indo-Europeans) over the <a href="Semitic%20people">Semites</a>.

Since the 19th century, numerous scholars have sought to use <a href="Archaeoastronomy%20and%20Vedic%20chronology">archaeoastronomical calculations</a> to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BCE. <a href="David%20Pingree">David Pingree</a>, a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned "the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers."

More recently Gallagher, Pyle, and <a href="Barry%20Fell">Fell</a> interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic <a href="Ogham">Ogham</a> alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site. The controversial translation was supposedly validated by a problematic archaeoastronomical indication in which the winter solstice sun shone on an inscription of the sun at the site. Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical claims, to describe it as an example of "<a href="Pseudoarchaeology">cult archaeology</a>".

Archaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of <a href="Archaeocryptography">Archaeocryptography</a>, when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulcán at Chichen Itza.

There are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy. <a href="http%3A//www.archaeoastronomy.org/">ISAAC—the International Society for Archaeoastronomy and Astronomy in Culture</a>—was founded in 1995 and now sponsors the Oxford conferences and "Archaeoastronomy — the Journal of Astronomy in Culture". <a href="http%3A//www.archeoastronomy.org/">SEAC— La Société Européenne pour l’Astronomie dans la Culture</a>—is slightly older; it was created in 1992. SEAC holds annual conferences in Europe and publishes refereed conference proceedings on an annual basis. There is also <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070927043749/http%3A//www.arqueoastronomia.org/siac.htm">SIAC— La Sociedad Interamericana de Astronomía en la Cultura</a>, primarily a <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n organisation which was founded in 2003. Two new organisations focused on regional archaeoastronomy were founded in 2013: <a href="http%3A//members.ozemail.com.au/%7Emmichie/bulletin_oct13.pdf">ASIA - the Australian Society for Indigenous Astronomy</a> in Australia and <a href="http%3A//www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC1306/S00043/modern-uses-for-ancient-maori-knowledge.htm">SMART - the Society of Māori Astronomy Research and Traditions</a> in New Zealand.

Additionally the "<a href="Journal%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Astronomy">Journal for the History of Astronomy</a>" publishes many archaeoastronomical papers. For twenty-seven volumes (from 1979 to 2002) it published an annual supplement "Archaeoastronomy". The "<a href="Journal%20of%20Astronomical%20History%20and%20Heritage">Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage</a>" (National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand), "Culture & Cosmos" (University of Wales, UK) and "Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry" (University of Aegean, Greece) also publish papers on archaeoastronomy.

Various national archaeoastronomical projects have been undertaken. Among them is the program at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research named "<a href="http%3A//www.tifr.res.in/%7Earchaeo/">Archaeo Astronomy in Indian Context</a>" that has made interesting findings in this field.

Andrzej Sapkowski

Andrzej Sapkowski (; born 21 June 1948) is a <a href="Poles">Polish</a> <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> writer. He is best known for his book series, "<a href="The%20Witcher">The Witcher</a>". His books have been translated so far into nineteen languages.

Sapkowski studied economics at the <a href="University%20of%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">University of Łódź</a>, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. He started his literary career as a translator, in particular, of science fiction. He says he wrote his first <a href="short%20story">short story</a>, "<a href="The%20Witcher">The Witcher</a>" ("Wiedźmin", also translated "The Hexer" or "Spellmaker") on a whim, in order to enter a contest by Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine "<a href="Fantastyka">Fantastyka</a>". Being an expert in marketing, he says he knew how to sell, and indeed, he won the 3rd prize. The story was published in "Fantastyka" in 1986 and was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a <a href="Novel%20sequence">cycle of tales</a> based on the world of "The Witcher", comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known <a href="fantasy%20author">fantasy author</a>s in Poland in the 1990s.

The main character of "The Witcher" is <a href="Geralt%20of%20Rivia">Geralt</a>, a <a href="mutant">mutant</a> hunter who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>'s signature character <a href="Philip%20Marlowe">Philip Marlowe</a>. The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by <a href="Slavic%20mythology">Slavic mythology</a>.

Sapkowski has won five <a href="Janusz%20A.%20Zajdel%20Award">Zajdel Award</a>s, including three for short stories "Mniejsze zło" ("Lesser Evil") (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" ("Sword of Destiny") (1992) and "W leju po bombie" ("In a Bomb Crater") (1993), and two for the novels, "<a href="Krew%20elf%C3%B3w">Krew elfów</a>" ("Blood of Elves") (1994) and <a href="Narrenturm%20%28novel%29">"Narrenturm"</a> (2002). He also won the Spanish <a href="Ignotus%20Award">Ignotus Award</a>, best anthology, for "The Last Wish" in 2003, and for "Muzykanci" ("The Musicians"), best foreign short story, same year. In 2003 he was nominated for one of Poland's most prestigious literary prizes <a href="Nike%20Award">Nike Award</a> for his novel <a href="Narrenturm%20%28novel%29">"Narrenturm"</a>.

In 1997, Sapkowski won the prestigious <a href="Polityka%27s%20Passport">Polityka's Passport</a> award, which is awarded annually to artists who have strong prospects for international success.

Since 2008 he has been an honorary citizen of the city of <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Łódź</a>.

In 2012 Sapkowski was awarded the <a href="Medal%20for%20Merit%20to%20Culture%20%E2%80%93%20Gloria%20Artis">Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis</a>.

Sapkowski's books have been translated into Czech, Hungarian, Russian, Lithuanian, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Finnish, Slovak, Bulgarian, Serbian, English, Italian, Dutch, Estonian and Swedish. An English translation of "<a href="The%20Last%20Wish%20%28book%29">The Last Wish</a>" short story collection was published by <a href="Victor%20Gollancz%20Ltd">Gollancz</a> in 2007. From 2008, the Witcher saga is published by <a href="Victor%20Gollancz%20Ltd">Gollancz</a>. The English translation of Sapkowski's novel "<a href="Blood%20of%20Elves">Blood of Elves</a>" won the <a href="David%20Gemmell%20Legend%20Award">David Gemmell Legend Award</a> in 2009.

In 2001, a <a href="The%20Hexer%20%28TV%20series%29">television series</a> based on the "Witcher" cycle was released in Poland and internationally, entitled "Wiedźmin" ("The Hexer"). A <a href="The%20Hexer%20%28film%29">film by the same title</a> was compiled from excerpts of the television series but both have been critical and box office failures.

The Polish game developer, <a href="CD%20Projekt%20RED">CD Projekt RED</a>, created a role-playing game series based on "The Witcher" universe. The first game, titled simply "<a href="The%20Witcher%20%28video%20game%29">The Witcher</a>", was first released in October 2007. The sequel, "" was released in 2011. The third and final game in the trilogy, "", was released in May 2015.

Sapkowski is a recipient of numerous awards from Polish fandom, as well as two <a href="European%20Science%20Fiction%20Society">European Science Fiction Society</a> awards (1996, 2010), <a href="David%20Gemmell%20Legend%20Award">David Gemmell Legend Award</a> (2009), and several Russian fandom awards.

<doc id="2866" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2866" title="Ammeter">
Ammeter

An ammeter (from Ampere Meter) is a <a href="measuring%20instrument">measuring instrument</a> used to measure the <a href="electric%20current">current</a> in a <a href="Electrical%20circuit">circuit</a>. Electric currents are measured in <a href="ampere">ampere</a>s (A), hence the name. Instruments used to measure smaller currents, in the milliampere or microampere range, are designated as "milliammeters" or "microammeters". Early ammeters were laboratory instruments which relied on the Earth's magnetic field for operation. By the late 19th century, improved instruments were designed which could be mounted in any position and allowed accurate measurements in <a href="electric%20power%20system">electric power system</a>s. It is generally represented by letter 'A' in a circle.

The relation between electric current, magnetic fields and physical forces was first noted by <a href="Hans%20Christian%20%C3%98rsted">Hans Christian Ørsted</a> who, in 1820, observed a <a href="compass">compass</a> needle was deflected from pointing North when a current flowed in an adjacent wire. The <a href="Galvanometer%23Tangent_galvanometer">tangent galvanometer</a> was used to measure currents using this effect, where the restoring force returning the pointer to the zero position was provided by the Earth's magnetic field. This made these instruments usable only when aligned with the Earth's field. Sensitivity of the instrument was increased by using additional turns of wire to multiply the effect – the instruments were called "multipliers".

The <a href="D%27Arsonval%20galvanometer">D'Arsonval galvanometer</a> is a moving coil ammeter. It uses <a href="magnetism">magnetic</a> <a href="Deflection%20%28engineering%29">deflection</a>, where current passing through a coil placed in the <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> of a permanent magnet causes the coil to move. The modern form of this instrument was developed by <a href="Edward%20Weston%20%28chemist%29">Edward Weston</a>, and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the deflection of the meter linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales. Basic meter movements can have full-scale deflection for currents from about 25 <a href="microampere">microampere</a>s to 10 <a href="milliampere">milliampere</a>s.

Because the magnetic field is polarised, the meter needle acts in opposite directions for each direction of current. A DC ammeter is thus sensitive to which way round it is connected; most are marked with a positive terminal, but some have centre-zero mechanisms and can display currents in either direction. A moving coil meter indicates the average (mean) of a varying current through it, which is zero for AC. For this reason moving-coil meters are only usable directly for DC, not AC.

This type of meter movement is extremely common for both ammeters and other meters derived from them, such as <a href="voltmeter">voltmeter</a>s and <a href="ohmmeter">ohmmeter</a>s.

Moving magnet ammeters operate on essentially the same principle as moving coil, except that the coil is mounted in the meter case, and a permanent magnet moves the needle. Moving magnet Ammeters are able to carry larger currents than moving coil instruments, often several tens of Amperes, because the coil can be made of thicker wire and the current does not have to be carried by the hairsprings.
Indeed, some Ammeters of this type do not have hairsprings at all, instead using a fixed permanent magnet to provide the restoring force.

An electrodynamic movement uses an electromagnet instead of the permanent magnet of the d'Arsonval movement. This instrument can respond to both alternating and direct current and also indicates <a href="true%20RMS">true RMS</a> for AC. See <a href="Wattmeter">Wattmeter</a> for an alternative use for this instrument.

Moving iron ammeters use a piece of <a href="iron">iron</a> which moves when acted upon by the electromagnetic force of a fixed coil of wire. The moving-iron meter was invented by <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n engineer <a href="Friedrich%20Drexler">Friedrich Drexler</a> in 1884. This type of meter responds to both <a href="direct%20current">direct</a> and <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a>s (as opposed to the moving-coil ammeter, which works on <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> only). The iron element consists of a moving vane attached to a pointer, and a fixed vane, surrounded by a coil. As alternating or direct current flows through the coil and induces a magnetic field in both vanes, the vanes repel each other and the moving vane deflects against the restoring force provided by fine helical springs. The deflection of a moving iron meter is proportional to the square of the current. Consequently, such meters would normally have a non linear scale, but the iron parts are usually modified in shape to make the scale fairly linear over most of its range. Moving iron instruments indicate the <a href="Root%20mean%20square">RMS</a> value of any AC waveform applied. Moving iron ammeters are commonly used to measure current in industrial frequency AC circuits.

In a hot-wire ammeter, a current passes through a wire which expands as it heats. Although these instruments have slow response time and low accuracy, they were sometimes used in measuring radio-frequency current. These also measure true RMS for an applied AC current.

In much the same way as the analogue ammeter formed the basis for a wide variety of derived meters, including voltmeters, the basic mechanism for a digital meter is a digital voltmeter mechanism, and other types of meter are built around this.

Digital ammeter designs use a <a href="shunt%20resistor">shunt resistor</a> to produce a calibrated voltage proportional to the current flowing. This voltage is then measured by a digital voltmeter, through use of an <a href="analog%20to%20digital%20converter">analog to digital converter</a> (ADC); the digital display is calibrated to display the current through the shunt. Such instruments are often calibrated to indicate the RMS value for a sine wave only, but many designs will indicate true RMS within limitations of the wave <a href="crest%20factor">crest factor</a>.

There is also a range of devices referred to as integrating ammeters. In these ammeters the current is summed over time, giving as a result the product of current and time; which is proportional to the electrical charge transferred with that current. These can be used for metering energy (the charge needs to be multiplied by the voltage to give energy) or for estimating the charge of a <a href="Battery%20%28electricity%29">battery</a> or <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>.

A picoammeter, or pico ammeter, measures very low electric current, usually from the picoampere range at the lower end to the milliampere range at the upper end. Picoammeters are used for sensitive measurements where the current being measured is below the theoretical limits of sensitivity of other devices, such as <a href="Multimeter">Multimeter</a>s.

Most picoammeters use a "virtual short" technique and have several different measurement ranges that must be switched between to cover multiple <a href="Decade%20%28log%20scale%29">decades of measurement</a>. Other modern picoammeters use <a href="Logarithmic%20scale">log compression</a> and a "current sink" method that eliminates range switching and associated <a href="voltage%20spike">voltage spike</a>s. Special design and usage considerations must be observed in order to reduce leakage current which may swamp measurements such as special insulators and <a href="driven%20shield">driven shield</a>s, <a href="triaxial%20cable">triaxial cable</a> is often used for probe connections.

The majority of ammeters are either connected in series with the circuit carrying the current to be measured (for small fractional amperes), or have their shunt resistors connected similarly in series. In either case, the current passes through the meter or (mostly) through its shunt. Ammeters must not be connected directly across a voltage source since their internal resistance is very low and excess current would flow. Ammeters are designed for a low <a href="voltage%20drop">voltage drop</a> across their terminals, much less than one volt; the extra circuit losses produced by the ammeter are called its "burden" on the measured circuit. 

Ordinary Weston-type meter movements can measure only milliamperes at most, because the springs and practical coils can carry only limited currents. To measure larger currents, a <a href="resistor">resistor</a> called a "<a href="shunt%20%28electrical%29%23Use%20in%20current%20measuring">shunt</a>" is placed in <a href="Series%20and%20parallel%20circuits">parallel</a> with the meter. The resistances of shunts is in the integer to fractional milliohm range. Nearly all of the current flows through the shunt, and only a small fraction flows through the meter. This allows the meter to measure large currents. Traditionally, the meter used with a shunt has a full-scale deflection (FSD) of , so shunts are typically designed to produce a voltage drop of when carrying their full rated current.
To make a multi-range ammeter, a selector switch can be used to connect one of a number of shunts across the meter. It must be a make-before-break switch to avoid damaging current surges through the meter movement when switching ranges.

A better arrangement is the <a href="Ayrton%20shunt">Ayrton shunt</a> or universal shunt, invented by <a href="William%20E.%20Ayrton">William E. Ayrton</a>, which does not require a make-before-break switch. It also avoids any inaccuracy because of contact resistance. In the figure, assuming for example, a movement with a full-scale voltage of 50 mV and desired current ranges of 10 mA, 100 mA, and 1 A, the resistance values would be: R1=4.5 ohms, R2=0.45 ohm, R3=0.05 ohm. And if the movement resistance is 1000 ohms, for example, R1 must be adjusted to 4.525 ohms.

Switched shunts are rarely used for currents above 10 amperes.

Zero-center ammeters are used for applications requiring current to be measured with both polarities, common in scientific and industrial equipment. Zero-center ammeters are also commonly placed in series with a <a href="battery%20%28electricity%29">battery</a>. In this application, the charging of the battery deflects the needle to one side of the scale (commonly, the right side) and the discharging of the battery deflects the needle to the other side. A special type of zero-center ammeter for testing high currents in cars and trucks has a pivoted bar magnet that moves the pointer, and a fixed bar magnet to keep the pointer centered with no current. The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.

Since the ammeter <a href="Shunt_%28electrical%29%23Use_in_current_measuring">shunt</a> has a very low resistance, mistakenly wiring the ammeter in parallel with a voltage source will cause a <a href="short%20circuit">short circuit</a>, at best blowing a fuse, possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury.

In AC circuits, a <a href="current%20transformer">current transformer</a> converts the magnetic field around a <a href="Electrical%20conductor">conductor</a> into a small AC current, typically either or at full rated current, that can be easily read by a meter. In a similar way, accurate AC/DC non-contact ammeters have been constructed using <a href="Hall%20effect">Hall effect</a> magnetic field sensors. A portable hand-held <a href="clamp%20meter">clamp-on ammeter</a> is a common tool for maintenance of industrial and commercial electrical equipment, which is temporarily clipped over a wire to measure current. Some recent types have a parallel pair of magnetically soft probes that are placed on either side of the conductor.

Anxiolytic

An anxiolytic (also antipanic or antianxiety agent) is the medication or other intervention that inhibits <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a>. This effect is in contrast to <a href="anxiogenic">anxiogenic</a> agents, which increase anxiety. Together these categories of <a href="Psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive</a> compounds or interventions may be referred to as <a href="anxiotropic">anxiotropic</a> compounds or agents. Some <a href="Recreational%20drug%20use">recreational drugs</a> such as <a href="alcohol%20%28drug%29">alcohol</a> (also known formally as <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>) induce anxiolysis initially; however, studies show that many of these drugs are anxiogenic. Anxiolytic <a href="medication">medication</a>s have been used for the treatment of <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a> and its related psychological and physical symptoms. Anxiolytics have been shown to be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorder. <a href="Light%20therapy">Light therapy</a> and other interventions have also been found to have an anxiolytic effect.

<a href="Beta-receptor%20blocker">Beta-receptor blocker</a>s such as <a href="propranolol">propranolol</a> and <a href="oxprenolol">oxprenolol</a>, although not anxiolytics, can be used to combat the somatic symptoms of anxiety such as <a href="tachycardia">tachycardia</a> and <a href="palpitation">palpitation</a>s.

Anxiolytics are also known as minor <a href="tranquilizer">tranquilizer</a>s. The term is less common in modern texts and was originally derived from a dichotomy with <a href="major%20tranquilizer">major tranquilizer</a>s, also known as <a href="neuroleptics">neuroleptics</a> or <a href="antipsychotics">antipsychotics</a>.

There are concerns that some <a href="GABAergic">GABAergic</a>s, such as <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s and <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s, may have an <a href="anxiogenic">anxiogenic</a> effect if used over long periods of time.

<a href="Barbiturate">Barbiturate</a>s exert an anxiolytic effect linked to the sedation they cause. The risk of abuse and addiction is high. Many experts consider these drugs obsolete for treating anxiety but valuable for the short-term treatment of severe insomnia, though only after benzodiazepines or non-benzodiazepines have failed.

Benzodiazepines are prescribed for short-term and long-term relief of severe and disabling anxiety. Benzodiazepines may also be indicated to cover the latent periods associated with the medications prescribed to treat an underlying anxiety disorder. They are used to treat a wide variety of conditions and symptoms and are usually a first choice when short-term <a href="Central%20nervous%20system">CNS</a> <a href="sedation">sedation</a> is needed.
If benzodiazepines are discontinued rapidly after being taken daily for two or more weeks there is some risk of <a href="benzodiazepine%20withdrawal">benzodiazepine withdrawal</a> and <a href="rebound%20syndrome">rebound syndrome</a>, which varies by the specific drug. Tolerance and dependence may also occur, but may be clinically acceptable. Cognitive and behavioral adverse effects are possible. Benzodiazepines include:


Benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic properties at moderate dosage. At higher dosage <a href="hypnotic">hypnotic</a> properties occur.


Marketed as a safer alternative to barbiturate anxiolytics, <a href="meprobamate">meprobamate</a> (Miltown, Equanil) was commonly used to relieve anxiety in the late 1950s and 1960s. Like barbiturates, therapeutic doses produce sedation and significant overdoses may be fatal. In the US, meprobamate has generally been replaced with benzodiazepines while the drug is now withdrawn in many European countries and Canada. The muscle relaxant <a href="carisoprodol">carisoprodol</a> has anxiolytic effects by metabolizing to meprobamate. Various other <a href="carbamate">carbamate</a>s have been found to share these effects, such as <a href="tybamate">tybamate</a> and <a href="lorbamate">lorbamate</a>.

<a href="Hydroxyzine">Hydroxyzine</a> (Atarax) is an <a href="antihistamine">antihistamine</a> originally approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1956. In addition to its antihistamine properties hydroxyzine possesses anxiolytic properties and is approved for the treatment of anxiety and tension. Its sedative properties are useful as a premedication before anesthesia or to induce sedation after anesthesia. Hydroxyzine has been shown to be as effective as <a href="benzodiazepines">benzodiazepines</a> in the treatment of <a href="generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</a>, while producing fewer side-effects. However, in practice, hydroxyzine is rarely as efficacious as the benzodiazepines.

<a href="Chlorpheniramine">Chlorpheniramine</a> (Chlor-Trimeton) and <a href="diphenhydramine">diphenhydramine</a> (Benadryl) have <a href="hypnotic">hypnotic</a> and <a href="sedative">sedative</a> effects with mild anxiolytic-like properties (<a href="off-label%20use">off-label use</a>). These drugs are approved by the FDA for <a href="allergy">allergies</a>, <a href="rhinitis">rhinitis</a>, and <a href="urticaria">urticaria</a>.

<a href="Opioid">Opioid</a>s are drugs that are usually only prescribed for their painkilling properties, but some research is beginning to find that some varieties are effective at treating depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, and other ailments often associated with or caused by anxiety. They have a very high potential for abuse and have one of the highest addiction rates for all drugs. Many people become addicted to these drugs because they are so effective at blocking emotional pain, including anxiety. Similarly to alcohol, people with anxiety disorders are more likely to become addicted to opioids due to their anxiolytic effect. These drugs range from the commonly prescribed <a href="hydrocodone">hydrocodone</a>, to the often illegal <a href="Diamorphine">Diamorphine</a>, and all the way to much more potent varieties like <a href="fentanyl">fentanyl</a> often used in trauma or end of life pain management. Most people purchasing these drugs illegally are seeking them out to get a euphoric like high, but many others seek them out because they are so effective at reducing both physical pain and emotional pain.

Because of their high potential for abuse and high overdose rates, prescribing opioids for mental health issues is very uncommon and frowned upon within the medical community. Safer opioids which are less likely to be abused, have less deadly drug interactions, and are less likely to cause overdose are the ones that are being looked into the most for their anxiolytic-type properties. Given that many anxiety sufferers are more prone to alcohol and opioid addiction, the potential danger in prescribing opioids is apparent. Benzodiazepines are very similar to alcohol in how they impact the user and the brain, and even though anxiety sufferers are more prone to alcohol addiction these drugs are still prescribed. The same logic is being used in the push to get opioids used for anxiety treatment. Opioids and benzodiazepines are very dangerous to use together, and using them together is one of the most common reasons for accidental mixed drug overdose in the United States, so great caution should be taken if opioid prescriptions for anxiety become more accepted.

It appears that <a href="buprenorphine">buprenorphine</a> is gaining some acceptability within in the medical community for being used to treat anxiety, OCD, and depression. Buprenorphine is similar to methadone in that it is used in opioid replacement therapy as well as pain management. It is much safer than methadone and lots of other opioids and has a very long half-life leading to less compulsive use among those who attempt to abuse it or become mentally addicted to it. There has been research into more commonly abused opioids being prescribed for anxiety disorder, but given that these drugs produce more euphoria and require more constant dosing when compared to buprenorphine, there is a much higher danger for abuse and overdose.

Antidepressant medications can reduce anxiety, and several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">USFDA</a> approved to treat various anxiety disorders. Antidepressants are especially beneficial because anxiety and <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> often <a href="Comorbidity">occur together</a>.

<a href="Selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of compounds typically used in the treatment of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s, <a href="Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">OCD</a> and some <a href="personality%20disorder">personality disorder</a>s. Primarily classified as antidepressants, most SSRIs have anxiolytic effects, although at higher dosages than used to treat depression. Paradoxically, SSRIs can <a href="Anxiogenic">increase anxiety</a> initially due to negative feedback through the serotonergic <a href="autoreceptors">autoreceptors</a>. For this reason a concurrent benzodiazepine is sometimes used temporarily until the anxiolytic effect of the SSRI occurs.

<a href="Serotonin%E2%80%93norepinephrine%20reuptake%20inhibitor">Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor</a> (SNRIs) include <a href="venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a> and <a href="duloxetine">duloxetine</a> drugs. Venlafaxine, in <a href="extended%20release">extended release</a> form, and duloxetine, are indicated for the treatment of <a href="Generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">GAD</a>. SNRIs are as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

<a href="Tricyclic%20antidepressants">Tricyclic antidepressants</a> (TCAs) have anxiolytic effects; however, side effects are often more troubling or severe and overdose is dangerous. Examples include <a href="imipramine">imipramine</a>, <a href="amitriptyline">amitriptyline</a>, <a href="nortriptyline">nortriptyline</a> and <a href="desipramine">desipramine</a>.

<a href="Mirtazapine">Mirtazapine</a> has demonstrated anxiolytic effects with a better side effect profile to all other classes of antidepressants, for example it rarely causes or exacerbates anxiety. However, in many countries (such as USA and Australia), it is not specifically approved for anxiety disorders and is used off label.

<a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitors">Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</a> (MAOIs) are effective for anxiety, but their dietary restrictions, side effects and availability of newer effective drugs, have limited their use. First generation MAO inhibitors include: <a href="phenelzine">phenelzine</a>, <a href="isocarboxazid">isocarboxazid</a> and <a href="tranylcypromine">tranylcypromine</a>. <a href="Moclobemide">Moclobemide</a>, a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, lacks the dietary restrictions associated with classic MAOI's. The drug is used in Canada, the UK and Australia.

<a href="Sympatholytic">Sympatholytic</a>s are a group of anti-hypertensives which inhibit activity of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>, and several medications within this group have shown anxiolytic effects as well as potential therapy for PTSD.

Although not officially approved for this purpose, <a href="beta%20blocker">beta blocker</a>s also can have an antianxiety effect.

The alpha1 antagonist <a href="prazosin">prazosin</a> could be effective for PTSD

The Alpha2 adrenergic agonists <a href="Clonidine">Clonidine</a> and <a href="guanfacine">guanfacine</a> have demonstrated both anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.

<a href="Mebicar">Mebicar</a> (mebicarum) is an anxiolytic produced in <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> and used in Eastern Europe. Mebicar has an effect on the structure of limbic-reticular activity, particularly on <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a> emotional zone, as well as on all 4 basic neuromediator systems – <a href="gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">γ aminobutyric acid</a> (GABA), <a href="choline">choline</a>, <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> and adrenergic activity. Mebicar decreases the brain noradrenaline level, exerts no effect on the dopaminergic systems, and increases the brain serotonin level.

<a href="Fabomotizole">Fabomotizole</a> (brand name Afobazole) is an anxiolytic drug launched in Russia in the early 2000s. Its mechanism of action remains poorly defined, with GABAergic, NGF and BDNF release promoting, MT1 receptor agonism, MT3 receptor antagonism, and sigma agonism all thought to have some involvement. It has yet to find clinical use outside of Russia.

<a href="Selank">Selank</a> is an anxiolytic peptide based drug developed by the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian academy of sciences. Selank is a heptapeptide with the sequence Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro. It is a synthetic <a href="structural%20analog">analog</a> of a human tetrapeptide <a href="tuftsin">tuftsin</a>. As such, it mimics many of its effects. It has been shown to modulate the expression of <a href="interleukin-6">interleukin-6</a> (IL-6) and affect the balance of T helper cell cytokines. There is evidence that it may also modulate the expression of <a href="brain-derived%20neurotropic%20factor">brain-derived neurotropic factor</a> in rats.

<a href="Bromantane">Bromantane</a> is a stimulant drug with anxiolytic properties developed in Russia during the late 1980s, which acts mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of both dopamine and serotonin in the brain, although it also has anticholinergic effects at very high doses. Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo.

<a href="Emoxypine">Emoxypine</a> is an <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> that is also a purported anxiolytic. Its chemical structure resembles that of <a href="pyridoxine">pyridoxine</a>, a form of vitamin B.

Azapirones are a class of <a href="5-HT1A%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a> <a href="agonist">agonist</a>s. Currently approved azapirones include <a href="buspirone">buspirone</a> (Buspar) and <a href="tandospirone">tandospirone</a> (Sediel).

<a href="Pregabalin">Pregabalin</a>'s anxiolytic effect appears after one week of use and is similar in effectiveness to <a href="lorazepam">lorazepam</a>, <a href="alprazolam">alprazolam</a>, and <a href="venlafaxine">venlafaxine</a>, but has demonstrated more consistent therapeutic effects for psychic and somatic anxiety symptoms. Long-term trials have shown continued effectiveness without the development of <a href="drug%20tolerance">tolerance</a>, and unlike benzodiazepines, it does not disrupt <a href="sleep%20architecture">sleep architecture</a> and produces less severe cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Pregabalin also exhibits a lower potential for abuse and dependence than benzodiazepines.

<a href="Menthyl%20isovalerate">Menthyl isovalerate</a> is a flavoring food additive which is marketed as a sedative and anxiolytic drug in Russia under the name "Validol". Sublingual administration of "Validol" produces a sedative effect, and has moderate reflex and vascular dilative action caused by stimulation of sensory nerve receptors of the oral mucosa followed by the release of endorphins. "Validol" is typically administered "as needed" for symptom relief.

<a href="Propofol">Propofol</a> produces anxiolytic effect, beneficial during medical procedures requiring sedation.

Some <a href="racetam">racetam</a> based drugs such as <a href="aniracetam">aniracetam</a> can have an antianxiety effect.

Certain natural substances are reputed to have anxiolytic properties, such as:

Due to deficits with existing anxiolytics (either in terms of efficacy or side-effect profile), research into novel anxiolytics is active. Possible candidates for future drugs include:


Prescription-free drugs are often poor anxiolytics and often worsen the symptoms over time. However, they are often used for self-medication because of their wide availability (e.g. <a href="alcoholic%20beverages">alcoholic beverages</a>).

Ethanol is used as an anxiolytic, sometimes by <a href="self-medication">self-medication</a>. <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a> can measure the anxiolytic effects of alcohol in the human brain. The <a href="British%20National%20Formulary">British National Formulary</a> states, "Alcohol is a poor hypnotic because its <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> action interferes with <a href="sleep">sleep</a> during the latter part of the night." Alcohol is also known to induce alcohol-related <a href="sleep%20disorder">sleep disorder</a>s.

The anxiolytic effects of solvents act as positive modulators of GABAA receptors (Bowen and colleagues 2006).

Psychotherapeutic treatment can be an effective alternative to medication. <a href="Exposure%20therapy">Exposure therapy</a> is the recommended treatment for phobic anxiety disorders. <a href="Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT) has been found to be effective treatment for <a href="panic%20disorder">panic disorder</a>, <a href="social%20anxiety%20disorder">social anxiety disorder</a>, <a href="generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</a>, and <a href="obsessive-compulsive%20disorder">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>. Healthcare providers can also help by educating sufferers about anxiety disorders and referring individuals to self-help resources. CBT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of <a href="generalized%20anxiety%20disorder">generalized anxiety disorder</a>, and possibly more effective than pharmacological treatments in the long term. Sometimes medication is combined with psychotherapy, but research has not found a benefit of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy versus monotherapy.

However, even with CBT being a viable treatment option, it can still be ineffective for many individuals. Both the Canadian and American medical associations then suggest the use of a strong but long lasting benzodiazepine such as <a href="clonazepam">clonazepam</a> and <a href="alprazolam">alprazolam</a> and an antidepressant, usually <a href="Prozac">Prozac</a> for its effectiveness.

<a href="Transcendental%20Meditation%20technique">Transcendental Meditation technique</a> shows marked efficacy in treating anxiety disorders says a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trials">randomized controlled trials</a>, ""TM practice is more effective than treatment as usual and most alternative treatments, with greatest effects observed in individuals with high anxiety""
And a <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> says: ""Differential effects of relaxation techniques on <a href="trait%20anxiety">trait anxiety</a>: a meta-analysis. Effect sizes for the different treatments (e.g., Progressive Relaxation, EMG Biofeedback, various forms of meditation, etc.) were calculated. Most of the treatments produced similar effect sizes except that Transcendental Meditation had significantly larger effect size (p less than .005)""

Regular practice of Transcendental Meditation enables some active duty service members battling <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> to reduce or even eliminate their psychotropic medication and get better control of their often-debilitating symptoms, researchers report in the journal Military Medicine.

Antipsychotic

Antipsychotics, also known as neuroleptics or major tranquilizers, are a class of <a href="medication">medication</a> primarily used to manage <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> (including <a href="delusion">delusion</a>s, <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s, <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a> or <a href="disordered%20thought">disordered thought</a>), principally in <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>. They are increasingly being used in the management of non-psychotic disorders. Antipsychotics are usually effective in relieving symptoms of psychosis in the short term.
The long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with <a href="List%20of%20long%20term%20side%20effects%20of%20antipsychotics">side effects</a> such as <a href="Tardive%20dyskinesia">involuntary movement disorders</a>, <a href="gynecomastia">gynecomastia</a>, and <a href="metabolic%20syndrome">metabolic syndrome</a>. They are also associated with increased mortality in elderly people with <a href="dementia">dementia</a>.
First-generation antipsychotics, known as <a href="typical%20antipsychotics">typical antipsychotics</a>, were discovered in the 1950s. Most second-generation drugs, known as <a href="atypical%20antipsychotics">atypical antipsychotics</a>, have been developed more recently, although the first atypical antipsychotic, <a href="clozapine">clozapine</a>, was discovered in the 1960s and introduced clinically in the 1970s. Both generations of medication tend to block receptors in the brain's <a href="dopamine%20pathway">dopamine pathway</a>s, but atypicals tend to act on <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> receptors as well. "Neuroleptic", originating from ("neuron") and "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89">λαμβάνω</a>" ("take hold of") - thus meaning ""which takes the nerve"" - refers to both common neurological effects and side effects.
Antipsychotics are most frequently used for the following conditions:

They are not recommended for <a href="dementia">dementia</a> or <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a> unless other treatments have not worked. They are not recommended in children unless other treatments are not effective or unless the child has psychosis.

Though recent studies confirm the neurotoxicity and extrapyramidal symptoms caused by antipsychotic use, antipsychotic drug treatment is a key component of schizophrenia treatment algorithms recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the American Psychiatric Association, and the British Society for Psychopharmacology. The main effect of treatment with antipsychotics is to reduce the so-called "positive" symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations. There is mixed evidence to support a significant impact of antipsychotic use on negative symptoms (such as apathy, lack of emotional affect, and lack of interest in social interactions) or on the cognitive symptoms (disordered thinking, reduced ability to plan and execute tasks) of schizophrenia. In general, the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment in reducing both positive and negative symptoms appears to increase with increasing severity of baseline symptoms.

Applications of antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia include prophylaxis in those showing symptoms that suggest that they are at high risk of developing psychosis, treatment of first episode psychosis, maintenance therapy, and treatment of recurrent episodes of acute psychosis.

Test batteries such as the PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic) and COPS (Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes), which measure low level psychotic symptoms, and others focused on cognitive disturbances (Basic symptoms"), are used to evaluate people with early, low level symptoms of psychosis. Used in combination with family history information, these tests can identify a "high risk" group having a 20–40% risk of progression to frank psychosis within 2 years. These patients are often treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs with the goal of reducing their symptoms and preventing progression to frank psychosis. While generally useful for reducing symptoms, the clinical trials performed to date provide little evidence that early use of antipsychotics, alone or in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy, provides improved long term outcomes in those with prodromal symptoms.

NICE recommends that all persons presenting with a first episode of frank psychosis be treated with both an antipsychotic drug and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). NICE further recommends that those expressing a preference for CBT alone be informed that combination treatment is more efficacious. A diagnosis of schizophrenia is not normally made at this time, as up to 25% of those presenting with first episode psychosis are eventually found to suffer from bipolar disorder instead. The goals of treatment of these patients include reducing symptoms and potentially improving long-term treatment outcomes. Randomized clinical trials have provided evidence for the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in achieving the former goal, with first-generation and second generation antipsychotics showing about equal efficacy. Evidence that early treatment has a favorable effect on long term outcomes is equivocal.

Placebo-controlled trials of both first and second generation antipsychotic drugs consistently demonstrate the superiority of active drug to placebo in suppressing psychotic symptoms. A large meta-analysis of 38 trials of antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia acute psychotic episodes showed an effect size of about 0.5. There is little or no difference in efficacy among approved antipsychotic drugs, including both first- and second-generation agents. The efficacy of such drugs is suboptimal. Few patients achieve complete resolution of symptoms. Response rates, calculated using various cutoff values for symptom reduction, are low and their interpretation is complicated by high placebo response rates and selective publication of clinical trial results.

The majority of patients treated with an antipsychotic drug will experience a response within 4 weeks. The goals of continuing treatment are to maintain suppression of symptoms, prevent relapse, improve quality of life, and support engagement in psychosocial therapy.

Maintenance therapy with antipsychotic drugs is clearly superior to placebo in preventing relapse, but is associated with weight gain, movement disorders, and high dropout rates. A 3-year trial following persons receiving maintenance therapy after an acute psychotic episode found that 33% obtained long-lasting symptom reduction, 13% achieved remission, and only 27% experienced satisfactory quality of life. The effect of relapse prevention on long term outcomes is uncertain, as historical studies show little difference in long term outcomes before and after the introduction of antipsychotic drugs.

A significant challenge in the use of antipsychotic drugs for the prevention of relapse is the poor rate of compliance. In spite of the relatively high rates of adverse effects associated with these drugs, some evidence, including higher dropout rates in placebo arms compared to treatment arms in randomized clinical trials, suggest that most patients who discontinue treatment do so because of suboptimal efficacy.

Antipsychotics are routinely used, often in conjunction with <a href="Mood%20stabilizer">mood stabilisers</a> such as <a href="Lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a>/<a href="Valproate%20semisodium">valproate</a>, as a first-line treatment for manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The reason for this combination is the therapeutic delay of the aforementioned mood stabilisers (for valproate therapeutic effects are usually seen around five days after treatment is commenced whereas lithium usually takes at least a week before the full therapeutic effects are seen) and the comparatively rapid antimanic effects of antipsychotic drugs. The antipsychotics have a documented efficacy when used alone in acute mania/mixed episodes.

Three atypical antipsychotics (<a href="lurasidone">lurasidone</a>, <a href="olanzapine">olanzapine</a> and <a href="quetiapine">quetiapine</a>) have also been found to possess efficacy in the treatment of bipolar depression as a monotherapy. Whereas only olanzapine and quetiapine have been proven to be effective broad-spectrum (i.e. against all three types of relapse— manic, mixed and depressive) prophylactic (or "maintenance") treatments in patients with bipolar disorder. A recent Cochrane review also found that olanzapine had a less favourable risk/benefit ratio than <a href="lithium%20%28medication%29">lithium</a> as a maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder.

The <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a> and the UK <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a> recommend antipsychotics for managing acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and as a longer-term maintenance treatment for reducing the likelihood of further episodes. They state that response to any given antipsychotic can be variable so that trials may be necessary, and that lower doses are to be preferred where possible. A number of studies have looked at levels of "compliance" or "adherence" with antipsychotic regimes and found that discontinuation (stopping taking them) by patients is associated with higher rates of relapse, including hospitalization.

An assessment for an underlying cause of behavior is needed before prescribing antipsychotic medication for symptoms of <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. Antipsychotics in old age dementia showed a modest benefit compared to placebo in managing aggression or psychosis, but this is combined with a fairly large increase in serious adverse events. Thus, antipsychotics should not be used routinely to treat dementia with aggression or psychosis, but may be an option in a few cases where there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to others. Psychosocial interventions may reduce the need for antipsychotics.

A number of atypical antipsychotics have some benefits when used in addition to other treatments in <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a>. Aripiprazole, quetiapine, and olanzapine (when used in conjunction with <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a>) have received the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) labelling for this indication. There is, however, a greater risk of side effects with their use.

Besides the above uses antipsychotics may be used for <a href="obsessive-compulsive%20disorder">obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, <a href="personality%20disorders">personality disorders</a>, <a href="Tourette%20syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>, <a href="autism">autism</a> and agitation in those with dementia. Evidence however does not support the use of atypical antipsychotics in <a href="eating%20disorder">eating disorder</a>s or personality disorder. <a href="Risperidone">Risperidone</a> may be useful for <a href="obsessive%20compulsive%20disorder">obsessive compulsive disorder</a>. The use of low doses of antipsychotics for <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, while common, is not recommended as there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. Low dose antipsychotics may also be used in treatment of impulse-behavioural and cognitive-perceptual symptoms of <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>.

In children they may be used in those with <a href="disruptive%20behavior%20disorder">disruptive behavior disorder</a>s, <a href="mood%20disorder">mood disorder</a>s and <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a>s or <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>. Antipsychotics are only weakly recommended for Tourette syndrome, because although they are effective, side effects are common. The situation is similar for those on the <a href="autism%20spectrum">autism spectrum</a>.
Much of the evidence for the off-label use of antipsychotics (for example, for dementia, OCD, PTSD, Personality Disorders, Tourette's) was of insufficient scientific quality to support such use, especially as there was strong evidence of increased risks of stroke, tremors, significant weight gain, sedation, and gastrointestinal problems. A UK review of unlicensed usage in children and adolescents reported a similar mixture of findings and concerns. A survey of children with <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a> found that 16.5% were taking an antipsychotic drug, most commonly for irritability, aggression, and agitation. Risperidone has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of irritability in autistic children and adolescents.

Aggressive challenging behavior in adults with <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> is often treated with antipsychotic drugs despite lack of an evidence base. A recent <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized controlled trial</a>, however, found no benefit over <a href="placebo">placebo</a> and recommended that the use of antipsychotics in this way should no longer be regarded as an acceptable routine treatment.

It is unclear whether the <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics</a> offer advantages over older, first generation antipsychotics. <a href="Amisulpride">Amisulpride</a>, <a href="olanzapine">olanzapine</a>, <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> and <a href="clozapine">clozapine</a> may be more effective but are associated with greater side effects. Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages.

Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ("treatment-resistant" or "refractory" schizophrenia), but it has the potentially serious side effect of <a href="agranulocytosis">agranulocytosis</a> (lowered <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a> count) in less than 4% of people.

Due to bias in the research the accuracy of comparisons of atypical antipsychotics is a concern.

In 2005, a US government body, the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health">National Institute of Mental Health</a> published the results of a major independent study (the CATIE project). No other atypical studied (<a href="risperidone">risperidone</a>, <a href="quetiapine">quetiapine</a>, and <a href="ziprasidone">ziprasidone</a>) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine, although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to <a href="extrapyramidal%20symptoms">extrapyramidal effects</a> compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%).

Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types.

Many researchers question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, and some even question the distinction between the two classes. In contrast, other researchers point to the significantly higher risk of <a href="tardive%20dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</a> and other extrapyramidal symptoms with the typicals and for this reason alone recommend first-line treatment with the atypicals, notwithstanding a greater propensity for metabolic adverse effects in the latter. The UK government organization <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">NICE</a> recently revised its recommendation favoring atypicals, to advise that the choice should be an individual one based on the particular profiles of the individual drug and on the patient's preferences.

The re-evaluation of the evidence has not necessarily slowed the bias toward prescribing the atypicals.

Generally, more than one antipsychotic drug should not be used at a time because of increased adverse effects.

Very rarely antipsychotics may cause <a href="tardive%20psychosis">tardive psychosis</a>.



Some studies have found decreased life expectancy associated with the use of antipsychotics, and argued that more studies are needed. Antipsychotics may also increase the risk of early <a href="death">death</a> in individuals with <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. Antipsychotics typically worsen symptoms in people who suffer from depersonalisation disorder. Antipsychotic <a href="polypharmacy">polypharmacy</a> (prescribing two or more antipsychotics at the same time for an individual) is a common practice but not evidence-based or recommended, and there are initiatives to curtail it. Similarly, the use of excessively high doses (often the result of polypharmacy) continues despite clinical guidelines and evidence indicating that it is usually no more effective but is usually more harmful.

Loss of <a href="grey%20matter">grey matter</a> and other brain structural changes over time are observed in schizophrenia. Meta-analyses of the effects of antipsychotic treatment on the course of grey matter loss and structural changes have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that grey matter loss is greater in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics relative to those treated with atypicals, and hypothesized a protective effect of atypicals as one possible explanation. A second meta-analysis suggested that treatment with antipsychotics was associated with increased grey matter loss.

Subtle, long-lasting forms of <a href="akathisia">akathisia</a> are often overlooked or confused with post-psychotic depression, in particular when they lack the extra pyramidal aspect that psychiatrists have been taught to expect when looking for signs of akathisia.

Withdrawal symptoms from antipsychotics may emerge during dosage reduction and discontinuation. Withdrawal symptoms can include <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="emesis">emesis</a>, <a href="Anorexia%20%28symptom%29">anorexia</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="rhinorrhea">rhinorrhea</a>, <a href="diaphoresis">diaphoresis</a>, <a href="myalgia">myalgia</a>, <a href="paresthesia">paresthesia</a>, <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a>, dysphoria or depression, cognitive dysfunction, worsening of negative symptoms, agitation, restlessness, and <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>. The psychological withdrawal symptoms can be mistaken for a relapse of the underlying disorder. Better management of the withdrawal syndrome may improve the ability of individuals to discontinue antipsychotics.

<a href="Tardive%20dyskinesia">Tardive dyskinesia</a> may abate during withdrawal from the antispsychotic agent, or it may persist.

Withdrawal effects may also occur when switching a person from one antipsychotic to another, (it is presumed due to variations of potency and receptor activity). Such withdrawal effects can include <a href="cholinergic">cholinergic</a> rebound, an activation syndrome, and motor syndromes including <a href="dyskinesia">dyskinesia</a>s. These adverse effects are more likely during rapid changes between antipsychotic agents, so making a gradual change between antipsychotics minimises these withdrawal effects. The <a href="British%20National%20Formulary">British National Formulary</a> recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. The process of cross-titration involves gradually increasing the dose of the new medication while gradually decreasing the dose of the old medication.

Clinically used antipsychotic medications are listed below by drug group. Trade names appear in parentheses.

Notes:

"† indicates drugs that are no longer (or were never) marketed in English-speaking countries. "

"‡ denotes drugs that are no longer (or were never to begin with) marketed in the United States. Some antipsychotics are not firmly placed in either first-generation or second-generation classes."

"# denotes drugs that have been withdrawn worldwide."





This category is for drugs that have been called both first and second-generation, depending on the literature being used.










Antipsychotic drugs such as <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a> and <a href="chlorpromazine">chlorpromazine</a> tend to block <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> <a href="dopamine%20receptor">D receptors</a> in the <a href="dopaminergic%20pathways">dopaminergic pathways</a> of the <a href="Human%20brain">brain</a>. This means that dopamine released in these pathways has less effect. Excess release of dopamine in the <a href="mesolimbic%20pathway">mesolimbic pathway</a> has been linked to psychotic experiences. Decreased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, and excess dopamine release in other pathways, are associated with psychotic episodes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
In addition to the antagonistic effects of dopamine, antipsychotics (in particular atypical neuroleptics) also antagonize <a href="5-HT2A">5-HT receptors</a>. Different <a href="allele">allele</a>s of the 5-HT receptor have been associated with schizophrenia and other psychoses, including depression. Higher concentrations of 5-HT receptors in cortical and subcortical areas, in particular in the right <a href="caudate%20nucleus">caudate nucleus</a> have been historically recorded. This is the same receptor that <a href="psychedelic%20drugs">psychedelic drugs</a> <a href="Agonist">agonize</a> to various degrees,
which explains the correlation between psychedelic drugs and schizophrenia.

Typical antipsychotics are not particularly selective and also block dopamine receptors in the <a href="mesocortical%20pathway">mesocortical pathway</a>, <a href="tuberoinfundibular%20pathway">tuberoinfundibular pathway</a>, and the <a href="nigrostriatal%20pathway">nigrostriatal pathway</a>. Blocking D receptors in these other pathways is thought to produce some unwanted <a href="adverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29">side effects</a> that the typical antipsychotics can produce (see above). They were commonly classified on a spectrum of low potency to high potency, where potency referred to the ability of the drug to bind to dopamine receptors, and not to the effectiveness of the drug. High-potency antipsychotics such as <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a>, in general, have doses of a few milligrams and cause less sleepiness and calming effects than low-potency antipsychotics such as <a href="chlorpromazine">chlorpromazine</a> and <a href="thioridazine">thioridazine</a>, which have dosages of several hundred milligrams. The latter have a greater degree of anticholinergic and antihistaminergic activity, which can counteract dopamine-related side-effects.

<a href="Atypical%20antipsychotic">Atypical antipsychotic</a> drugs have a similar blocking effect on D receptors, however, most also act on serotonin receptors, especially <a href="5-HT2A%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="5-HT2C%20receptor">5-HT</a> receptors. Both clozapine and quetiapine appear to bind just long enough to elicit antipsychotic effects but not long enough to induce extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin hypersecretion. 5-HT antagonism increases dopaminergic activity in the <a href="nigrostriatal%20pathway">nigrostriatal pathway</a>, leading to a lowered extrapyramidal side effect liability among the atypical antipsychotics.

The original antipsychotic drugs were happened upon largely by chance and then tested for their effectiveness. The first, <a href="chlorpromazine">chlorpromazine</a>, was developed as a surgical <a href="anesthetic">anesthetic</a>. It was first used on psychiatric patients because of its powerful calming effect; at the time it was regarded as a non-permanent "pharmacological <a href="lobotomy">lobotomy</a>". Lobotomy at the time was used to treat many behavioral disorders, including psychosis, although its effect was to markedly reduce behavior and mental functioning of all types. However, chlorpromazine proved to reduce the effects of psychosis in a more effective and specific manner than lobotomy, even though it was known to be capable of causing severe sedation. The underlying <a href="neurochemistry">neurochemistry</a> involved has since been studied in detail, and subsequent antipsychotic drugs have been discovered by an approach that incorporates this sort of information.

The discovery of chlorpromazine's psychoactive effects in 1952 led to greatly reduced use of restraint, seclusion, and sedation in the management of agitated patients, and also led to further research that resulted in the development of <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, <a href="anxiolytic">anxiolytic</a>s, and the majority of other drugs now used in the management of psychiatric conditions. In 1952, <a href="Henri%20Laborit">Henri Laborit</a> described chlorpromazine only as inducing indifference towards what was happening around them in nonpsychotic, nonmanic patients, and <a href="Jean%20Delay">Jean Delay</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Deniker">Pierre Deniker</a> described it as controlling manic or psychotic agitation. The former claimed to have discovered a treatment for agitation in anyone, and the latter team claimed to have discovered a treatment for psychotic illness.

Until the 1970s there was considerable debate within psychiatry on the most appropriate term to use to describe the new drugs. In the late 1950s the most widely used term was "neuroleptic", followed by "major tranquilizer" and then "ataraxic". The first recorded use of the term tranquilizer dates from the early nineteenth century. In 1953 Frederik F. Yonkman, a chemist at the Swiss-based <a href="Ciba%20Specialty%20Chemicals">Ciba</a>pharmaceutical company, first used the term tranquilizer to differentiate <a href="reserpine">reserpine</a> from the older sedatives. The word "neuroleptic" was coined in 1955 by Delay and Deniker after their discovery (1952) of the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine. It is derived from the ("neuron", originally meaning "<a href="sinew">sinew</a>" but today referring to the <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s) and "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B2%CE%AC%CE%BD%CF%89">λαμβάνω</a>" ("lambanō", meaning "take hold of"). Thus, the word means "taking hold of one's nerves". It was often taken to refer also to common side effects such as reduced activity in general, as well as lethargy and impaired motor control. Although these effects are unpleasant and in some cases harmful, they were at one time, along with akathisia, considered a reliable sign that the drug was working. The term "ataraxy" was coined by the neurologist Howard Fabing and the classicist Alister Cameron to describe the observed effect of psychic indifference and detachment in patients treated with chlorpromazine. This term derived from the Greek adjective "<a href="wikt%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%84%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82">ἀτάρακτος</a>" ("<a href="wikt%3Aataractic">ataraktos</a>"), which means "not disturbed, not excited, without confusion, steady, calm". In the use of the terms "<a href="tranquilizer">tranquilizer</a>" and "ataractic", medical practitioners distinguished between the "major tranquilizers" or "major ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat psychoses, and the "minor tranquilizers" or "minor ataractics", which referred to drugs used to treat <a href="neurosis">neuroses</a>. While popular during the 1950s, these terms are infrequently used today. They are being abandoned in favor of "antipsychotic", which refers to the drug's desired effects. Today, "minor tranquilizer" can refer to <a href="anxiolytic">anxiolytic</a> and/or <a href="hypnotic">hypnotic</a> drugs such as the <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s and <a href="nonbenzodiazepines">nonbenzodiazepines</a>, which have some antipsychotic properties and are recommended for concurrent use with antipsychotics, and are useful for insomnia or drug-induced psychosis. They are powerful (and potentially addictive) sedatives.

Antipsychotics are broadly divided into two groups, the <a href="typical%20antipsychotic">typical or first-generation antipsychotics</a> and the <a href="atypical%20antipsychotic">atypical or second-generation antipsychotics</a>. The typical antipsychotics are classified according to their chemical structure while the atypical antipsychotics are classified according to their pharmacological properties. These include serotonin-dopamine antagonists (see <a href="dopamine%20antagonist">dopamine antagonist</a> and <a href="serotonin%20antagonist">serotonin antagonist</a>), multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics (MARTA, those targeting several systems), and <a href="dopamine%20partial%20agonists">dopamine partial agonists</a>, which are often categorized as atypicals.

The term "major tranquilizer" was used for older antipsychotic drugs. The term "neuroleptic" is often used as a <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for "antipsychotic", even though - strictly speaking - the two terms are not interchangeable. "Antipsychotic" drugs are a subgroup of "neuroleptic" drugs, because the latter have a wider range of effects.

Antipsychotics were once among the biggest selling and most profitable of all drugs, generating $22 billion in global sales in 2008. By 2003 in the US, an estimated 3.21 million patients received antipsychotics, worth an estimated $2.82 billion. Over 2/3 of prescriptions were for the newer, more expensive atypicals, each costing on average $164 per year, compared to $40 for the older types. By 2008, sales in the US reached $14.6 billion, the biggest selling drugs in the US by therapeutic class.

Antipsychotics are sometimes administered as part of compulsory psychiatric treatment via <a href="involuntary%20commitment">inpatient (hospital) commitment</a> or <a href="outpatient%20commitment">outpatient commitment</a>. They may be administered orally or, in some cases, through long-acting (depot) injections administered in the <a href="dorsogluteal%20muscle">dorsgluteal</a>, <a href="ventrogluteal%20area">ventrogluteal</a> or <a href="deltoid%20muscle">deltoid muscle</a>.

Joanna Moncrieff has argued that antipsychotic drug treatment is often undertaken as a means of control rather than to treat specific symptoms experienced by the patient. Moncreiff has further argued that the evidence for antipsychotics from discontinuation-relapse studies may be flawed, because they do not take into account that antipsychotics may sensitize the brain and provoke psychosis if discontinued, which may then be wrongly interpreted as a relapse of the original condition.

Use of this class of drugs has a history of criticism in residential care. As the drugs used can make patients calmer and more compliant, critics claim that the drugs can be overused. Outside doctors can feel under pressure from care home staff. In an official review commissioned by UK government ministers it was reported that the needless use of antipsychotic medication in dementia care was widespread and was linked to 1800 deaths per year. In the US, the government has initiated legal action against the pharmaceutical company <a href="Johnson%20%26amp%3B%20Johnson">Johnson & Johnson</a> for allegedly paying <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">kickbacks</a> to <a href="Omnicare">Omnicare</a> to promote its antipsychotic <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> (Risperdal) in nursing homes.

There has also been controversy about the role of <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> companies in <a href="marketing">marketing</a> and promoting antipsychotics, including allegations of downplaying or covering up adverse effects, expanding the number of conditions or illegally promoting off-label usage; influencing drug trials (or their publication) to try to show that the expensive and profitable newer atypicals were superior to the older cheaper typicals that were out of patent. Following charges of illegal marketing, settlements by two large pharmaceutical companies in the US set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One case involved <a href="Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Company">Eli Lilly and Company</a>'s antipsychotic <a href="Zyprexa">Zyprexa</a>, and the other involved <a href="Bextra">Bextra</a>. In the Bextra case, the government also charged <a href="Pfizer">Pfizer</a> with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, <a href="Geodon">Geodon</a>. In addition, <a href="Astrazeneca">Astrazeneca</a> faces numerous personal-injury lawsuits from former users of <a href="Seroquel">Seroquel</a> (quetiapine), amidst federal investigations of its marketing practices. By expanding the conditions for which they were indicated, Astrazeneca's Seroquel and Eli Lilly's Zyprexa had become the biggest selling antipsychotics in 2008 with global sales of $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion respectively.

Harvard medical professor <a href="Joseph%20Biederman">Joseph Biederman</a> conducted research on bipolar disorder in children that led to an increase in such diagnoses. A 2008 Senate investigation found that Biederman also received $1.6 million in speaking and consulting fees between 2000 and 2007 — some of them undisclosed to Harvard — from companies including makers of antipsychotic drugs prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. <a href="Johnson%20%26amp%3B%20Johnson">Johnson & Johnson</a> gave more than $700,000 to a research center that was headed by Biederman from 2002 to 2005, where research was conducted, in part, on <a href="Risperdal">Risperdal</a>, the company's antipsychotic drug. Biederman has responded saying that the money did not influence him and that he did not promote a specific diagnosis or treatment.

Pharmaceutical companies have also been accused of attempting to set the mental health agenda through activities such as funding <a href="consumer%20advocacy%20groups">consumer advocacy groups</a>.

It is recommended that persons with dementia who exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms should not be given antipsychotics before trying other treatments. When taking antipsychotics this population has increased risk of cerebrovascular effects, <a href="parkinsonism">parkinsonism</a> or <a href="extrapyramidal%20symptoms">extrapyramidal symptoms</a>, sedation, confusion and other cognitive adverse effects, weight gain, and increased mortality. Physicians and caretakers of persons with dementia should try to address symptoms including agitation, aggression, apathy, anxiety, depression, irritability, and psychosis with alternative treatments whenever antipsychotic use can be replaced or reduced. Elderly persons often have their dementia treated first with antipsychotics and this is not the best management strategy.

Archduke Charles of Austria, Duke of Teschen (German: Erzherzog Carl Ludwig Johann Joseph Laurentius von Österreich, Herzog von Teschen; 5 September 1771 – 30 April 1847) was an <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>n field-marshal, the third son of <a href="Emperor%20Leopold%20II">Emperor Leopold II</a> and his wife, <a href="Maria%20Luisa%20of%20Spain">Maria Luisa of Spain</a>. He was also the younger brother of <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Despite being <a href="epilepsy">epileptic</a>, Charles achieved respect both as a commander and as a reformer of the Austrian army. He was considered one of <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon's</a> most formidable opponents.

He began his career fighting the revolutionary armies of France. Early in the wars of the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a>, he saw victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Neerwinden%20%281793%29">Neerwinden</a> in 1793, before being defeated at <a href="Battle%20of%20Wattignies">Wattignies</a> 1793 and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fleurus%20%281794%29">Fleurus</a> 1794. In 1796, as chief of all Austrian forces on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, Charles defeated <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Amberg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, and then won a victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Emmendingen</a> that forced <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Marie%20Moreau">Jean Victor Marie Moreau</a> to withdraw across the Rhine. Following these victories were others at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Messkirch">Messkirch</a> in 1799. He reformed Austria's armies to adopt the nation at arms principle; in 1809, he went into the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Coalition">War of the Fifth Coalition</a> and inflicted Napoleon's first major setback at <a href="Battle%20of%20Aspern-Essling">Aspern-Essling</a>, before suffering a defeat at the bloody <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Battle of Wagram</a>. Following Wagram, Charles saw no more significant action in the Napoleonic Wars.

As a military strategist, historians compare him to <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>, conservative, cautious, and competent. Charles was a study in contrasts. As a practitioner, he was flawless in executing complex and risky maneuvers of troops in the heat of battle, achieving brilliant victories in the face of almost certain defeat. Yet, as a theoretician, his devotion to ground and caution led his contemporary, <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a>, to criticize his rigidity and adherence to geographic strategy. Regardless, he remains among Austria's pantheon of heroes of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.

Charles was born in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. His father, then Grand Duke of Tuscany, generously permitted Charles's childless aunt <a href="Archduchess%20Maria%20Christina%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Teschen">Archduchess Marie Christine of Austria</a> and her husband <a href="Albert%20of%20Saxe-Teschen">Albert of Saxe-Teschen</a> to adopt and raise the boy in Vienna. Charles spent his youth in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, at <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and in the Austrian Netherlands, where he began his career of military service in the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">wars of the French Revolution</a>. He commanded a brigade at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jemappes">Battle of Jemappes</a> (1792), and in the campaign of 1793 distinguished himself at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aldenhoven%20%281794%29">Action of Aldenhoven</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Neerwinden%20%281793%29">Battle of Neerwinden</a>. In this year he became <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20the%20Habsburg%20Netherlands">Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands</a>, an office he lost with the occupation of the Low Countries by the French revolutionaries in 1794. The year he became Governor he also received the army rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20Field%20Marshal">Lieutenant Field Marshal</a>. Shortly thereafter another promotion saw him made "<a href="Feldzeugmeister">Feldzeugmeister</a>" (equivalent of Lieutenant General). In the remainder of the war in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> he held high commands, and was present at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fleurus%20%281794%29">Battle of Fleurus</a> (1794).

In 1795 he served on the Rhine, and in the following year, he was entrusted with chief control of all the Austrian forces on that river. His conduct of the operations against <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jourdan</a> and <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Marie%20Moreau">Moreau</a> in 1796 marked him out at once as one of the greatest generals in Europe. At first falling back carefully and avoiding a decision, he finally marched away, leaving a mere screen in front of Moreau. Falling upon Jourdan, he beat him in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Amberg</a> (August) and <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a> (September), and drove him over the Rhine with great loss. He then turned upon Moreau's army, which he defeated and forced out of Germany (<a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Battle of Emmendingen</a>, October).

In 1797 he was sent to arrest the victorious march of <a href="Napoleon">General Bonaparte</a> in Italy, and he conducted the retreat of the over-matched Austrians with the highest skill. In the campaign of 1799 he once more opposed <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jourdan</a>, whom he defeated in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a>, following up his success by invading <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Switzerland</a> and defeating <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">Masséna</a> in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Zurich">First Battle of Zurich</a>, after which he re-entered Germany and drove the French once more over the Rhine.

Ill-health, however, forced him to retire to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, but he was soon recalled to undertake the task of checking Moreau's advance on Vienna. The result of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hohenlinden">Battle of Hohenlinden</a> had, however, foredoomed the attempt, and the archduke had to make the armistice of <a href="Steyr">Steyr</a>. His popularity was now such that the <a href="Perpetual%20Diet%20of%20Regensburg">Perpetual Diet of Regensburg</a>, which met in 1802, resolved to erect a statue in his honor and to give him the title of savior of his country, but Charles refused both distinctions.

In the short and disastrous war of 1805 Archduke Charles commanded what was intended to be the main army in Italy, but events made Germany the decisive theatre of operations; Austria sustained defeat on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, and the archduke was defeated by Massena in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Caldiero%20%281805%29">Battle of Caldiero</a>. With the conclusion of peace he began his active work of army reorganization, which was first tested on the field in 1809.

In 1806 Francis II (now Francis I of Austria) named the Archduke Charles, already a <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28Germany%29">field marshal</a>, as Commander in Chief of the Austrian army and Head of the <a href="Council%20of%20War%20%28Austria%29">Council of War</a>. Supported by the prestige of being the only general who had proved capable of defeating the French, he promptly initiated a far-reaching scheme of reform, which replaced the obsolete methods of the 18th century. The chief characteristics of the new order were the adoption of the nation in arms principle and the adoption of French war organization and tactics. The army reforms were not yet completed by the war of 1809, in which Charles acted as commander in chief, yet even so it proved a far more formidable opponent than the old and was only defeated after a desperate struggle involving Austrian victories and large loss of life on both sides.

Its initial successes were neutralized by the reverses of <a href="Battle%20of%20Abensberg">Abensberg</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Landshut%20%281809%29">Landshut</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Eckm%C3%BChl">Eckmühl</a> but, after the evacuation of Vienna, the archduke won a strong victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aspern-Essling">Battle of Aspern-Essling</a> but soon afterwards lost at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Battle of Wagram</a>. At the end of the campaign the archduke gave up all his military offices.

When Austria joined the ranks of the allies during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of the Sixth Coalition</a>, Charles was not given a command and the post of commander-in-chief of the allied Grand Army of Bohemia went to the <a href="Karl%20Philipp%2C%20Prince%20of%20Schwarzenberg">Prince of Schwarzenberg</a>. Charles spent the rest of his life in retirement, except for a short time in 1815 when he was military governor of the <a href="Fortress%20Mainz">Fortress Mainz</a>. In 1822 he succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Teschen.

On 15 September/17 September 1815 in <a href="Weilburg">Weilburg</a>, Charles married Princess <a href="Henrietta%20of%20Nassau-Weilburg">Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg</a> (1797–1829). She was a daughter of <a href="Frederick%20William%20of%20Nassau-Weilburg">Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg</a> (1768–1816) and his wife <a href="Burgravine%20Louise%20Isabelle%20of%20Kirchberg">Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg</a>.

Frederick William was the eldest surviving son of <a href="Karl%20Christian%20of%20Nassau-Weilburg">Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg</a> and <a href="Princess%20Wilhelmine%20Carolina%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Princess Wilhelmine Carolina of Orange-Nassau</a>.

Wilhelmine Carolina was a daughter of <a href="William%20IV%2C%20Prince%20of%20Orange">William IV, Prince of Orange</a> and <a href="Anne%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Princess%20of%20Orange">Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange</a>. Anne was in turn the eldest daughter of <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II of Great Britain</a> and <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Caroline of Ansbach</a>.

Charles died at <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> on 30 April 1847. He is buried in tomb 122 in the <a href="Imperial%20Crypt%20Vaults%23The%20New%20Vault">New Vault</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Crypt">Imperial Crypt</a> in Vienna. An equestrian statue was erected to his memory on the <a href="Heldenplatz">Heldenplatz</a> in Vienna in 1860.

The caution which the <a href="archduke">archduke</a> preached so earnestly in his strategic works, he displayed in practice only when the situation seemed to demand it, though his education certainly prejudiced him in favor of the defensive at all costs. He was at the same time capable of forming and executing the most daring offensive strategy, and his tactical skill in the handling of troops, whether in wide turning movements, as at Würzburg and Zürich, or in masses, as at Aspern and Wagram, was certainly equal to that of any leader of his time, with only a few exceptions.
His <a href="military%20campaign">campaign</a> of 1796 is considered almost faultless. That he sustained defeat in 1809 was due in part to the great numerical superiority of the French and their allies, and in part to the condition of his newly reorganized troops. His six weeks' inaction after the victory of Aspern is, however, open to unfavorable criticism. As a military writer, his position in the evolution of the art of war is very important, and his doctrines had naturally the greatest weight. Nevertheless, they cannot but be considered antiquated even in 1806. Caution and the importance of strategic points are the chief features of his system. The rigidity of his geographical strategy may be gathered from the prescription that this principle is never to be departed from.

Again and again he repeats the advice that nothing should be hazarded unless one's army is completely secure, a rule which he himself neglected with such brilliant results in 1796. Strategic points, he says, not the defeat of the enemy's army, decide the fate of one's own country, and must constantly remain the general's main concern, a <a href="Maxim%20%28philosophy%29">maxim</a> which was never more remarkably disproved than in the war of 1809. The editor of the archduke's work is able to make but a feeble defense against <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a>'s reproach that Charles attached more value to ground than to the annihilation of the foe. In his tactical writings the same spirit is conspicuous. His reserve in battle is designed to cover a retreat.

The baneful influence of these antiquated principles was clearly shown in the maintenance of <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6niggr%C3%A4tz">Königgrätz-Josefstadt</a> in 1866 as a strategic point, which was preferred to the defeat of the separated Prussian armies, and in the strange plans produced in Vienna for the campaign of 1859, and in the almost unintelligible <a href="Battle%20of%20Montebello%20%281859%29">Battle of Montebello</a> in the same year. The theory and the practice of Archduke Charles form one of the most curious contrasts in military history. In the one he is unreal, in the other he displayed, along with the greatest skill, a vivid activity which made him for long the most formidable opponent of Napoleon.

He was the 831st <a href="Knight">Knight</a> of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Fleece">Order of the Golden Fleece</a> in <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>.

When <a href="Karl%20Mack%20von%20Leiberich">Karl Mack von Leiberich</a> became chief of staff of the army under <a href="Prince%20Josias%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a> in the Netherlands, he issued the "Instruktionspunkte fur die gesamte Herren Generals", the last of 19 points setting out the roles of staff officers, dealing with offensive and defensive operations, while helping the Commander-in-chief. In 1796, Archduke Charles augmented these with his own "Observationspunkte", writing of the Chief of Staff: “he is duty bound to consider all possibilities related to operations and not view himself as merely carrying out those instructions”. On 20 March 1801, Feldmarschalleutnant Duka became the world's first peacetime "Generalquartiermeister" at the head of the staff and the wartime role of the Chief of Staff was now focused on planning and operations to assist the Commander. Archduke Charles produced a new Dienstvorschrift on 1 September 1805, which divided the staff into three: 1) Political Correspondence; 2) the Operations Directorate, dealing with planning and intelligence; 3) the Service Directorate, dealing with administration, supply and military justice. The Archduke set out the position of a modern Chief of Staff: “The Chief of Staff stands at the side of the Commander-in-Chief and is completely at his disposal. His sphere of work connects him with no specific unit”. “The Commander-in-Chief decides what should happen and how; his chief assistant works out these decisions, so that each subordinate understands his allotted task”. With the creation of the Korps in 1809, each had a staff, whose chief was responsible for directing operations and executing the overall headquarters plan.

Augustine of Canterbury

Augustine of Canterbury (born first third of the 6th century – died probably 26 May 604) was a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> <a href="monk">monk</a> who became the first <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in the year 597. He is considered the "Apostle to the English" and a founder of the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England">Catholic Church in England</a>.

Augustine was the <a href="prior">prior</a> of a monastery in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> when Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory the Great</a> chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a>, to Britain to <a href="Christianization">Christianize</a> King <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a> and his <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kingdom of Kent</a> from <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a>. Kent was probably chosen because Æthelberht had married a Christian princess, <a href="Bertha%20of%20Kent">Bertha</a>, daughter of <a href="Charibert%20I">Charibert I</a> the <a href="List%20of%20Frankish%20kings">King of Paris</a>, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Thanet">Isle of Thanet</a> and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>.

King Æthelberht converted to Christianity and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a <a href="bishop">bishop</a> and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a> in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at <a href="London">London</a>, and <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a> in 604, and a school was founded to train <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the <a href="consecration">consecration</a> of his successor, <a href="Laurence%20of%20Canterbury">Laurence of Canterbury</a>. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a <a href="saint">saint</a>.

After the withdrawal of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a> from their province of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> in 410, the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>. Before the Roman withdrawal, Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> <a href="Pelagius">Pelagius</a>. Britain sent three bishops to the <a href="Synod%20of%20Arles%23Council%20of%20Arles%20in%20314">Council of Arles</a> in 314, and a <a href="Gaulish">Gaulish</a> bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360. After the Roman legions departed, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">British Church</a> developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of <a href="Easter">Easter</a> and the style of the <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a> haircut that clerics wore. Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of <a href="Saint%20Alban">Saint Alban</a> and the occurrence in place names of "eccles", derived from the Latin "ecclesia", meaning "church". There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons. The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.

It was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595. The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588, and perhaps earlier than 560. Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I, one of the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> kings of the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>. As one of the conditions of her marriage, she brought a bishop named <a href="Liudhard">Liudhard</a> with her to Kent. Together in Canterbury, they restored a church that dated to Roman times—possibly the current <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Canterbury">St Martin's Church</a>. Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries. The historian <a href="Ian%20N.%20Wood">Ian N. Wood</a> feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen. Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people. More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved. The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> who, as pagans and <a href="Arian">Arian</a> Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.

Aside from Æthelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King <a href="Ceawlin%20of%20Wessex">Ceawlin of Wessex</a> in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having <a href="imperium">imperium</a> (overlordship) south of the <a href="Humber">River Humber</a>. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the <a href="language%20barrier">language barrier</a> between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.

In 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the <a href="San%20Gregorio%20Magno%20al%20Celio">Abbey of St Andrew's</a> in Rome, to head the mission to Kent. The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King <a href="Theuderic%20II">Theuderic II</a> of <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a> and to King <a href="Theudebert%20II">Theudebert II</a> of <a href="Austrasia">Austrasia</a>, as well as their grandmother <a href="Brunhilda%20of%20Austrasia">Brunhild</a>, seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King <a href="Chlothar%20II">Chlothar II</a> of <a href="Neustria">Neustria</a> for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission. By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people. Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.

Sources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.

Augustine was accompanied by Laurence of Canterbury, his eventual successor to the <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>ric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks. Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere. In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent. They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival: Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services. Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion, but it probably took place in 597. In the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">early medieval</a> period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent. Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism. A <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">late medieval</a> tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler <a href="Thomas%20Elmham">Thomas Elmham</a>, gives the date of the king's conversion as <a href="Pentecost">Whit Sunday</a>, or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it. Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch <a href="Eulogius%20of%20Alexandria">Eulogius of Alexandria</a> in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted. His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.

Augustine established his <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a> at Canterbury. It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of <a href="Arles">Arles</a>, Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands. The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.

Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the <a href="monastery">monastery</a> of Saints <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>, which later became <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, on land donated by the king. This foundation has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the <a href="Rule%20of%20St.%20Benedict">Rule of St. Benedict</a> into England, but there is no evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule at the time of its foundation. In a letter Gregory wrote to the <a href="patriarch%20of%20Alexandria">patriarch of Alexandria</a> in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place. However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire. Little literary traces remain of them, however. One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.

After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success, along with questions about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>"; this section of the "History" is usually known as the "<a href="Libellus%20responsionum">Libellus responsionum</a>". Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.

Further missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a <a href="pallium">pallium</a> for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s, <a href="relic">relic</a>s, and books. The pallium was the symbol of <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan</a> status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to <a href="York">York</a>. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. The move from Canterbury to London never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason, but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Essex">kingdom of Essex</a>, ruled by Æthelberht's nephew <a href="Saebert%20of%20Essex">Saebert of Essex</a>, who converted to Christianity in 604. The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.

In 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain. Two men who had come to Britain with him in 601 were consecrated, <a href="Mellitus">Mellitus</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a> and <a href="Justus">Justus</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>. Bede relates that Augustine, with the help of the king, "recovered" a church built by Roman Christians in Canterbury. It is not clear if Bede meant that Augustine rebuilt the church or that Augustine merely reconsecrated a building that had been used for pagan worship. Archaeological evidence seems to support the latter interpretation; in 1973 the remains of an aisled building dating from the <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> period were uncovered just south of the present <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>. The historian Ian Wood argues that the existence of the "Libellus" points to more contact between Augustine and the native Christians because the topics covered in the work are not restricted to conversion from paganism, but also dealt with relations between differing styles of Christianity.

Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and <a href="Dumnonia">Dumnonia</a> to the west. Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him, apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case. According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part. In 603, Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people, who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops, they refused to recognise him as their archbishop. There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised. Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops. Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.

Gregory also instructed Augustine on other matters. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20II">St Sixtus</a>.

Gregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.

<a href="The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Canterbury">The King's School, Canterbury</a> claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>n mission. Augustine received <a href="liturgical%20book">liturgical book</a>s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, but it would have been a form of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> language liturgy in use at Rome.

Before his death, Augustine consecrated <a href="Laurence%20of%20Canterbury">Laurence of Canterbury</a> as his successor to the archbishopric, probably to ensure an orderly transfer of office. Although at the time of Augustine's death, 26 May 604, the mission barely extended beyond Kent, his undertaking introduced a more active missionary style into the British Isles. Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in the British Isles. Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself. Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.

Augustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury, but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted. After the Conquest, his <a href="shrine">shrine</a> in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus. King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a> granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day <a href="fair">fair</a> around the date on which Augustine's relics were <a href="Translation%20%28relics%29">translated</a> to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.

A life of Augustine was written by <a href="Goscelin">Goscelin</a> around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, who claimed that Augustine founded <a href="Cerne%20Abbey">Cerne Abbey</a>, the author (generally believed to be <a href="John%20Brompton">John Brompton</a>) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their <a href="Romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romances</a>. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury quite often, however. During the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.

Augustine's shrine was re-established in March 2012 at the church of <a href="Pugin%27s%20Church%20and%20Shrine%20of%20St%20Augustine">St. Augustine</a> in <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a>, Kent, very close to the mission's landing site. <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Cross">St Augustine's Cross</a>, a <a href="Celtic%20cross">Celtic cross</a> erected in 1884, marks the spot in <a href="Ebbsfleet%2C%20Thanet">Ebbsfleet, Thanet</a>, <a href="East%20Kent">East Kent</a>, where Augustine is said to have landed.

<doc id="2881" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2881" title="Alexander of Hales">
Alexander of Hales

Alexander of Hales, O.F.M., (c. 118521 August 1245) (also Halensis, Alensis, Halesius, Alesius) also called "Doctor Irrefragibilis" (by <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20IV">Pope Alexander IV</a> in the "Bull De Fontibus Paradisi") and "Theologorum Monarcha" was a theologian and philosopher important in the development of <a href="Scholasticism">Scholasticism</a> and of the <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> School.

Alexander was born at Hales, <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> (today <a href="Halesowen">Halesowen</a>, <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28county%29">West Midlands</a>), <a href="England">England</a>, between 1180 and 1186. He came from a rather wealthy country family. He studied at the University of Paris and became a master of arts sometime before 1210. He began to read theology in 1212 or 1213, and became a regent master in 1220 or 1221. He introduced the <a href="Sentences">Sentences</a> of Peter Lombard as the basic textbook for the study of theology. During the University strike of 1229, Alexander participated in an embassy to Rome to discuss the place of Aristotle in the curriculum. Having held a prebend at Holborn (prior to 1229) and a canonry of St. Paul’s in London (1226-1229), he visited England in 1230 and received a canonry and an archdeaconry in Coventry and Lichfield, his native diocese. He taught at Paris in the academic year 1232-33, but was appointed to a delegation by Henry III of England in 1235, along with Simon Langton and Fulk Basset, to negotiate for the renewal of the peace between England and France.

In 1236 or 1237, aged about 50, Alexander made the surprising step of entering the <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> Order, thus becoming the first Franciscan friar to hold a University chair. His doctrinal positions became the starting point for the Franciscan school of theology. He continued to teach and to represent the University, and participated in the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Lyon">First Council of Lyon</a> in the winter of 1245.

After returning to Paris, Alexander fell ill, probably due to an epidemic then sweeping the city. Shortly before his death, he passed his chair on to <a href="John%20of%20La%20Rochelle">John of La Rochelle</a>, setting the precedent for that chair to be held by a Franciscan. Alexander died at Paris on 21 August 1245.

As the first <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> to hold a chair at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>, Alexander had many significant disciples. He was called "Doctor Irrefragibilis" (Irrefutable Teacher) and "Doctor Doctorum" (Teacher of Teachers). The latter title is especially suggestive of his role in forming several Franciscans who later became influential thinkers in the faculty, among them <a href="Saint%20Bonaventure">Saint Bonaventure</a>, John of La Rochelle, Odo Rigaldus, William of Middleton and <a href="Richard%20Rufus%20of%20Cornwall">Richard Rufus of Cornwall</a>. Bonaventure, who may not have sat under Alexander directly, nevertheless referred to Alexander as his "father and master" and wished to "follow in his footsteps."

Alexander is known for reflecting the works of several other Middle Age thinkers, especially those of <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Saint Anselm</a> and <a href="Saint%20Augustine">Saint Augustine</a>. He was also known to quote thinkers such as <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Saint Bernard</a> and <a href="Richard%20of%20Saint-Victor">Richard of Saint-Victor</a>. He differs from those in his genre as he is known to reflect his own interests and those of his generation. When using the works of his authorities, Alexander does not only review their reasoning but also gives conclusions, expands on them, and offers his agreements and disagreement with them. He was also different in that he appeals to Pre-Lombardian figures, and in his use of <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a> and <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, whose works were not cited as frequently by other 12th-century scholastics. Aristotle is also quite frequently quoted in Alexander's works. Alexander was fascinated by the Pseudo-Dionysian hierarchy of angels and in how their nature can be understood, given Aristotelian <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>.

Among the doctrines which were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of Hales, are the "thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum" (treasury of supererogatory merits) and the "<a href="character%20indelibilis">character indelibilis</a>" (sacramental character) of <a href="baptism">baptism</a>, <a href="confirmation%20%28sacrament%29">confirmation</a>, and <a href="Holy%20Orders">ordination</a>. That doctrine had been written about much earlier by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> and was eventually defined a <a href="dogma">dogma</a> by the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>. He also posed an important question about the cause of the <a href="Incarnation">Incarnation</a>: would Christ have been incarnated if humanity had never sinned? The question eventually became the focal point for a philosophical issue (the theory of possible worlds) and a theological topic on the distinction between God's absolute power ("potentia absoluta") and His ordained power ("potentia ordinata").

He had written the summary/commentary of Peter Lombard's four books of the "Sentences". It had exposed the trinitarian theology of the Greeks. This had been the most important writing that Alexander had claimed, and it had been the earliest in the genre. While it is common for scholars to state that Alexander was the first to write a commentary on the "<a href="Sentences">Sentences</a>" of <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a>, it is not quite accurate. Authorship is more contentious for this work; although he started this work, he died before it could be finished, and it most likely was more a product of people other than Alexander. There were a number of "commentaries" on the "Sentences", but Alexander's appears to have been the first magisterial commentary. Although it was Alexander's most significant writing, it had not been completed, therefore leaving historians with many questions on the reliability and quality of the writing. This was taken into consideration when the "Summa" had been examined by Father Victorin Doucet for different editions of them. The sources has seem to be the resulting problem of the "Summa", "counted there were 4814 explicit quotations and 1372 implicit quotations from <a href="Augustine">Augustine</a>, more than one quarter of texts were cited in the body of the "Summa".

Of Alexander's "Summa", which was on one occasion proclaimed by an assembly of seventy doctors to be infallible, <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> declared that, though it was as heavy as the weight of a horse, it was full of errors and displayed ignorance of physics, of metaphysics, and even of logic.

Alexander also influenced and sometimes is confused with <a href="Alexander%20Carpenter">Alexander Carpenter</a>, Latinized as "Fabricius" (fl. 1429), who was the author of the "Destructorium viciorum", a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries. Carpenter also authored other works, such as ""Homiliae eruditae"" ("Learned Sermons").

Alexander was said to have been among the earliest scholastics to engage with Aristotle's newly translated writings. Between 1220 and 1227, he wrote "Glossa in quatuor libros Sententiarum Petri Lombardi" ("A Gloss on the <a href="Sentences">Four Books of the Sentences</a> of <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a>") (composed in the mid-12th century), which was particularly important because it was the first time that a book other than the Bible was used as a basic text for theological study. This steered the development of scholasticism in a more systematic direction, inaugurating an important tradition of writing commentaries on the "Sentences" as a fundamental step in the training of master theologians.

In doing so, he elevated Lombard's work from a mere theological resource to the basic framework of questions and problems from which masters could teach. The commentary (or more correctly titled a "Gloss") survived in student reports from Alexander's teaching in the classroom and so it provides a major insight into the way theologians taught their discipline in the 1220s. As is the case with "Glossa" and "Quaestiones Disputatae", much of his work is probably written in the form of notes on his oral teachings by students, though the content is definitely his.

For his contemporaries, however, Alexander's fame was his inexhaustible interest in disputation. His disputations prior to his becoming a Franciscan cover over 1,600 pages in their modern edition. His disputed questions after 1236 remain unpublished. Alexander was also one of the first scholastics to participate in the "Quodlibetal", a university event in which a master had to respond to any question posed by any student or master over a period of three days. Alexander's "Quodlibetal questions" also remain unedited.

At the beginning of 1236, he entered the Franciscan order (he was at least 50) and was the first Franciscan to hold a chair at the University of Paris. He held this post until shortly before his death in Paris in 1245. When he became a Franciscan and thus created a formal Franciscan school of theology at Paris, it was soon clear that his students lacked some of the basic tools for the discipline. Alexander responded by beginning a "Summa theologiae" that is now known as the "Summa fratris Alexandri". Alexander drew mainly from his own disputations, but also selected ideas, arguments and sources from his contemporaries. It treats in its first part the doctrines of <a href="God">God</a> and his attributes; in its second, those of <a href="creation%20myth">creation</a> and <a href="sin">sin</a>; in its third, those of <a href="Salvation">redemption</a> and <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">atonement</a>; and, in its fourth and last, those of the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s. This massive text, which <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> would later sarcastically describe as weighing as much as a horse, was unfinished at his death; his students, William of Middleton and John of Rupella, were charged with its completion. It was certainly read by the Franciscans at Paris, including <a href="Bonaventure">Bonaventure</a>.

Alexander was an innovative theologian. He was part of the generation that first grappled with the writings of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. While there was a ban on using Aristotle's works as teaching texts, theologians like Alexander continued to exploit his ideas in their theology. Two other uncommon sources were promoted by Alexander: <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, whose writings had been ignored for almost a century, gained an important advocate in Alexander and he used Anselm's works extensively in his teaching on <a href="Christology">Christology</a> and <a href="soteriology">soteriology</a>; and, <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>, whom Alexander used in his examination of the theology of Orders and ecclesiastical structures.

Though he also continued the tradition of Aristotle- and Augustine-focused thought in the Franciscan school, he did so through an <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>-directed lens. In fact, Alexander was one of the major influences for the advancement of Anselmian thought in the 13th century. One such example is the idea of original sin as a lack of justice. Alexander believed that original sin is both a punishment as well as a cause for punishment. That is to say, the body is corrupt, but the soul is clean. Alexander advances the idea that it would not be God’s fault to create a being that would bind the ‘corrupt’ with the ‘clean’. He advanced a highly original response that the soul naturally desires the body. Consequently, God is both merciful in giving the soul what it wants, as well as just in punishing the soul for binding with the corrupt flesh. Either the soul knew that the body was corrupt, or it did not (in which case it would be “laboring under ignorance”); both of these considerations are cause for divine punishment.

Alexander is also known for rejecting the idea that there are many things in God’s mind, instead claiming that it is more perfect to know just one thing. He did not start off with this view, though. In the "Glossa", he openly suggests the idea of the multiplicity of divine ideas. In his later work, "Quaestio disputata antequam erat Frater 46", he finally rejects the plurality of divine ideas, and this theme continues through the rest of his works. Specifically, in one of his last works, "De scientia divina", he concludes that the idea of <a href="wikt%3Aplurality">plurality</a> itself is strictly temporal, a human notion.

One of his more famous works, the "Summa", is important because of its system for determining if a war is just. There are six requirements for determining this: authority and attitude (in reference to who declares the war), intention and condition (in reference to the soldiers), merit (of the enemy) and just cause. Just cause becomes the overarching moral principle for declaring war in three ways: the relief of good people, coercion of the wicked, and peace for all. It is important to note that Alexander put ‘peace for all’ at the end of the list to amplify its importance.

Active Server Pages (ASP), later known as Classic ASP or ASP Classic, is <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s first <a href="server-side%20scripting">server-side</a> <a href="Active%20Scripting">script engine</a> for <a href="dynamic%20web%20page">dynamically generated web pages</a>.

<a href="ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>, first released in January 2002, has superseded ASP.

Initially released as an add-on to <a href="Internet%20Information%20Services">Internet Information Services</a> (IIS) via the <a href="Windows%20NT%204.0%23Option%20Pack">Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack</a> (ca. 1996), it is included as a free component of <a href="Windows%20Server">Windows Server</a> (since the initial release of <a href="Windows%202000%20Server">Windows 2000 Server</a>). There have been three versions of ASP, each introduced with different versions of IIS:


ASP 2.0 provides six built-in <a href="Object%20%28computer%20science%29">objects</a>: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. codice_1 object, for example, represents a <a href="Session%20%28computer%20science%29">session</a> that maintains the state of <a href="Variable%20%28programming%29">variables</a> from page to page. The <a href="Active%20Scripting">Active Scripting</a> engine's support of the <a href="Component%20Object%20Model">Component Object Model</a> (COM) enables ASP <a href="website">website</a>s to access functionality in compiled <a href="Library%20%28computing%29">libraries</a> such as <a href="Dynamic-link%20library">DLLs</a>.

ASP 3.0 does not differ greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enables buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.

ASP remains supported until 14 January 2020 on <a href="Windows%207">Windows 7</a>. The use of ASP pages will be supported on <a href="Windows%208">Windows 8</a> for a minimum of 10 years from the <a href="Windows%208">Windows 8</a> release date.

ASP uses <a href="server-side%20scripting">server-side scripting</a> to generate content that is sent to the client's web browser. The ASP interpreter reads and executes all script code between <% and %> tags, the result of which is content generation. These scripts were written using <a href="VBScript">VBScript</a>, <a href="JScript">JScript</a>, or <a href="PerlScript">PerlScript</a>. The codice_2 directive, the syntax or server configuration can be used to select the language. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is in an <a href="HTML">HTML</a> page; it would be dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.
Web pages with the ".asp" <a href="filename%20extension">filename extension</a> use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes by using the more common ".htm" or ".html" extensions. Pages with the ".aspx" extension use compiled <a href="ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term "Classic ASP" for the original technology.

ASP runs only on <a href="Windows">Windows</a>. A number of products emulate some of the functionality of Classic ASP on non-Microsoft web servers. Apache::ASP for example ports Classic ASP to the Apache Web Server, but can only interpret <a href="PerlScript">PerlScript</a>.

Sun Java System ASP (formerly ChiliSoft ASP) was a popular and reportedly complete emulator, but it has been discontinued.

Amoxicillin is used in the treatment of a number of infections, including <a href="acute%20otitis%20media">acute otitis media</a>, <a href="streptococcal%20pharyngitis">streptococcal pharyngitis</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="Cellulitis">skin infections</a>, <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a>s, "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" infections, <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a>, and <a href="Chlamydia%20infection">chlamydia</a> infections.

Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate have been recommended by guidelines as the drug of choice for bacterial <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a> and other respiratory infections. Most sinusitis infections are caused by viruses, for which amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate are ineffective, and the small benefit gained by Amoxicillin may be overridden by the adverse effects. 
Amoxicillin is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment for community-acquired pneumonia in adults by the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Health%20and%20Care%20Excellence">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence</a>, either alone (mild to moderate severity disease) or in combination with a <a href="macrolide">macrolide</a>. The World Health Organization recommends amoxicillin as first-line treatment for pneumonia that is not "severe". Amoxicillin is used in post-exposure inhalation of <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> to prevent disease progression and for prophylaxis.

It is effective in the treatment of stomach infections of "<a href="Helicobacter%20pylori">Helicobacter pylori</a>". When used to treat H. pylori infection it is combined with lansoprazole, clarithromycin, omeprazole and others in varying amounts and dosage schedules. It is also used to treat <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a> in children under eight-years old.

Amoxicillin is occasionally used for the treatment of skin infections, such as <a href="acne%20vulgaris">acne vulgaris</a>. It is often an effective treatment for cases of acne vulgaris that have responded poorly to other antibiotics, such as <a href="doxycycline">doxycycline</a> and <a href="minocycline">minocycline</a>.

Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of infants with signs and symptoms of pneumonia in resource-limited situations when the parents are unable or unwilling to accept hospitalization of the child. Amoxicillin in combination with <a href="gentamicin">gentamicin</a> is recommended for the treatment of infants with signs of other severe infections when hospitalization is not an option.

It is also used to prevent <a href="bacterial%20endocarditis">bacterial endocarditis</a> in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>" and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without <a href="spleen">spleen</a>s, such as people with <a href="sickle-cell%20disease">sickle-cell disease</a>, and for both the prevention and the treatment of <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>. The United Kingdom recommends against its use for infectious endocarditis prophylaxis. These recommendations do not appear to have changed the rates of infection for infectious endocarditis.

Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by <a href="beta-lactamase">β-lactamase</a>-producing bacteria, which are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics, such as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>. For this reason, it may be combined with <a href="clavulanic%20acid">clavulanic acid</a>, a β-lactamase inhibitor. This drug combination is commonly called <a href="Coamoxiclav">co-amoxiclav</a>.

It is a moderate-spectrum, bacteriolytic, <a href="%CE%B2-lactam%20antibiotic">β-lactam antibiotic</a> in the <a href="aminopenicillin">aminopenicillin</a> family used to treat susceptible <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> and <a href="Gram-negative">Gram-negative</a> bacteria. It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better-absorbed, following oral administration, than other β-lactam antibiotics. 
In general, "<a href="Streptococcus">Streptococcus</a>, <a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>, <a href="Enterococcus">Enterococcus</a>, <a href="Haemophilus">Haemophilus</a>, <a href="Helicobacter">Helicobacter</a>," and "<a href="Moraxella">Moraxella</a>" are susceptible to amoxicillin, whereas "<a href="Citrobacter">Citrobacter</a>, <a href="Klebsiella">Klebsiella</a>" and "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" are resistant to it. Some "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" and most clinical strains of "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" have developed resistance to amoxicillin to varying degrees.

<a href="Adverse%20drug%20reaction">Side effect</a>s are similar to those for other <a href="%CE%B2-lactam%20antibiotic">β-lactam antibiotic</a>s, including <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated <a href="colitis">colitis</a>. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, lightheadedness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.

The onset of an allergic reaction to amoxicillin can be very sudden and intense; emergency medical attention must be sought as quickly as possible. The initial phase of such a reaction often starts with a change in mental state, skin rash with intense itching (often beginning in fingertips and around groin area and rapidly spreading), and sensations of fever, nausea, and vomiting. Any other symptoms that seem even remotely suspicious must be taken very seriously. However, more mild allergy symptoms, such as a rash, can occur at any time during treatment, even up to a week after treatment has ceased. For some people allergic to amoxicillin, the side effects can be fatal due to <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a>.

Use of the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination for more than one week has caused mild <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a> in some patients. Young children having ingested acute overdoses of amoxicillin manifested <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a>, vomiting, and <a href="Renal%20failure">renal dysfunction</a>.

Between 3 and 10% of children taking amoxicillin (or <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a>) show a late-developing (>72 hours after beginning medication and having never taken penicillin-like medication previously) rash, which is sometimes referred to as the "amoxicillin rash". The rash can also occur in adults.

The rash is described as <a href="maculopapular">maculopapular</a> or morbilliform (<a href="Measles">measles-like</a>; therefore, in medical literature, it is called "amoxicillin-induced morbilliform rash".) It starts on the trunk and can spread from there. This rash is unlikely to be a true allergic reaction, and is not a contraindication for future amoxicillin usage, nor should the current regimen necessarily be stopped. However, this common amoxicillin rash and a dangerous allergic reaction cannot easily be distinguished by inexperienced persons, so a healthcare professional is often required to distinguish between the two.

A nonallergic amoxicillin rash may also be an indicator of <a href="infectious%20mononucleosis">infectious mononucleosis</a>. Some studies indicate about 80-90% of patients with acute <a href="Epstein%20Barr%20virus">Epstein Barr virus</a> infection treated with amoxicillin or ampicillin develop such a rash.

Amoxicillin may interact with these drugs:
Amoxicillin diffuses easily into tissues and body fluids. Penetration into the central nervous system increases in meningitis. It will cross the placenta and is excreted into breastmilk in small quantities. It is excreted into the urine and metabolized by the liver. It has an onset of 30 minutes and a half-life of 3.7 hours in newborns and 1.4 hours in adults.

Amoxicillin attaches to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. It also is a bactericidal compound. It is effective against "Streptococci", Pneumococci, Enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonell, Borrelia burgdorferi and Helicobactor pylori. As a derivative of <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a>, amoxicillin is a member of the same family as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s and, like them, is a <a href="%CE%B2-lactam%20antibiotic">β-lactam antibiotic</a>. It inhibits <a href="cross-link">cross-link</a>age between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> of <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive</a> and a minor component of <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative bacteria</a>. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics. 
It has two <a href="ionizable">ionizable</a> groups in the physiological range (the amino group in alpha-position to the amide carbonyl group and the carboxyl group).

Amoxicillin was one of several <a href="semisynthesis">semisynthetic</a> derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (<a href="6-APA">6-APA</a>) developed at <a href="Beecham%20Group">Beecham, England</a> in the 1960s. It became available in 1972, and was the second <a href="aminopenicillin">aminopenicillin</a> to reach the market (after <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a> in 1961). <a href="Coamoxiclav">Co-amoxiclav</a> became available in 1981.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers make amoxicillin in <a href="Hydrate">trihydrate</a> form, for oral use available as capsules, regular, chewable and dispersible <a href="Tablet%20%28pharmacy%29">tablets</a>, syrup and <a href="pediatrics">pediatric</a> <a href="Suspension%20%28chemistry%29">suspension</a> for oral use, and as the sodium salt for <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a> administration. Amoxicillin is most commonly taken orally. The liquid forms are helpful where the patient might find it difficult to take tablets or capsules.
Intravenous form is not sold in USA. In the USA when amoxicillin is needed intravenously, it is usually accomplished by adding amoxicillin powder to bags of Saline Solution. There are small saline bags that have a screw off cap on the top of them to allow the powder to be added, commonly called piggy back bags by medical staff. Powdered Amoxicillin can be mixed with saline solution or sterile water to be used in a syringe, but because of the slow delivery time that is needed to inject the solution (3–4 minutes for solution containing 1g of amoxicillin powder) this method is seldom used.
<a href="Ampicillin">Ampicillin</a> can also be used instead of amoxicillin when person can't swallow and needs antibiotics as it has the same spectrum as amoxicillin.

Research with mice indicated successful delivery using <a href="intraperitoneally">intraperitoneally</a> injected amoxicillin-bearing <a href="microparticles">microparticles</a>.

"Amoxicillin" is the <a href="International%20Nonproprietary%20Name">INN</a>, <a href="British%20Approved%20Name">BAN</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Adopted%20Name">USAN</a>, while "amoxycillin" is the <a href="Australian%20Approved%20Name">AAN</a>.

Amoxicillin is one of the semisynthetic penicillins discovered by <a href="Beecham%20%28pharmaceutical%20company%29">Beecham</a> scientists. The patent for amoxicillin has expired, thus amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav preparations are marketed under hundreds of trade names and/or have several synonyms across the world.

Amorphous solid

In <a href="condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed matter physics</a> and <a href="materials%20science">materials science</a>, an amorphous (from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "a", without, "morphé", shape, form) or non-crystalline solid is a <a href="solid">solid</a> that lacks the <a href="long-range%20order">long-range order</a> that is characteristic of a <a href="crystal">crystal</a>. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with <a href="glass">glass</a>. Nowadays, "glassy solid" or "amorphous solid" is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: A glass is an amorphous solid that exhibits a <a href="glass%20transition">glass transition</a>. Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include <a href="gel">gel</a>s, <a href="thin%20film">thin film</a>s, and nanostructured materials such as glass.

Amorphous materials have an internal structure made of interconnected structural blocks. Whether a material is <a href="liquid">liquid</a> or solid depends primarily on the connectivity between its elementary building blocks so that solids are characterized by a high degree of connectivity whereas structural blocks in fluids have lower connectivity (see figure on amorphous material states).
Even amorphous materials have some shortrange order at the atomic length scale due to the nature of <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>ing (see <a href="structure%20of%20liquids%20and%20glasses">structure of liquids and glasses</a> for more information on non-crystalline material structure). Furthermore, in very small <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s a large fraction of the <a href="atom">atom</a>s are
the crystal; relaxation of the surface and interfacial effects distort the atomic positions, decreasing the structural order. Even the most advanced structural characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, have difficulty in distinguishing between amorphous and crystalline structures on these length scales.

Amorphous phases are important constituents of <a href="thin%20film">thin film</a>s, which are solid layers of a few <a href="nanometre">nanometre</a>s to some tens of <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s thickness deposited upon a substrate. So-called structure zone models were developed to describe the micro structure and ceramics of thin films as a function of the <a href="homologous%20temperature">homologous temperature</a> "T" that is the ratio of deposition temperature over melting temperature. According to these models, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the occurrence of amorphous phases is that "T" has to be smaller than 0.3, that is the deposition temperature must be below 30% of the melting temperature. For higher values, the surface diffusion of deposited atomic species would allow for the formation of crystallites with long range atomic order.

Regarding their applications, amorphous metallic layers played an important role in the discussion of a suspected <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> in <a href="amorphous%20metal">amorphous metal</a>s. Today, <a href="optical%20coating">optical coating</a>s made from <a href="Titanium%20dioxide">TiO</a>, <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">SiO</a>, <a href="Tantalum%20pentoxide">TaO</a> etc. and combinations of them in most cases consist of amorphous phases of these compounds. Much research is carried out into thin amorphous films as a gas separating <a href="Biological%20membrane">membrane</a> layer. The technologically most important thin amorphous film is probably represented by few nm thin SiO layers serving as isolator above the conducting channel of a metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (<a href="MOSFET">MOSFET</a>). Also, hydrogenated <a href="amorphous%20silicon">amorphous silicon</a>, a-Si:H in short, is of technical significance for <a href="thin%20film%20solar%20cells">thin film solar cells</a>. In case of a-Si:H the missing long-range order between silicon atoms is partly induced by the presence by hydrogen in the percent range.

The occurrence of amorphous phases turned out as a phenomenon of particular interest for studying thin film growth. Remarkably, the growth of polycrystalline films is often used and preceded by an initial amorphous layer, the thickness of which may amount to only a few nm. The most investigated example is represented by thin multicrystalline silicon films, where such as the unoriented molecule. An initial amorphous layer was observed in many studies. Wedge-shaped polycrystals were identified by <a href="transmission%20electron%20microscopy">transmission electron microscopy</a> to grow out of the amorphous phase only after the latter has exceeded a certain thickness, the precise value of which depends on deposition temperature, background pressure and various other process parameters. The phenomenon has been interpreted in the framework of <a href="Polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29%23Ostwald%27s%20rule">Ostwald's rule</a> of stages that predicts the formation of phases to proceed with increasing condensation time towards increasing stability. Experimental studies of the phenomenon require a clearly defined state of the substrate surface and its contaminant density etc., upon which the thin film is deposited.

A Wizard of Earthsea

A Wizard of Earthsea is a <a href="young%20adult%20fiction">young adult</a> <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> novel written by the American author <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, first published by the <a href="small%20press">small press</a> Parnassus in 1968. Regarded as a classic of fantasy and children's literature, the novel has been widely influential within the genre of fantasy. 

Set in the fictional <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> of <a href="Earthsea%20%28universe%29">Earthsea</a>, the story centers around a young <a href="Magician%20%28fantasy%29">mage</a> named <a href="Ged%20%28Earthsea%29">Ged</a>, born in a village on the island of Gont. Displaying great power while still a boy, he joins the school of wizardry, where his prickly nature drives him into conflict with one of his fellows. During a magical duel, Ged's spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature that attacks him. The novel follows his journey as he seeks to be free of the creature.

The book has often been described as a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>" or coming of age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. Although the structure of the story is similar to that of a traditional epic, critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist <a href="Person%20of%20color">dark-skinned</a>, in comparison to more typical <a href="White%20people">white-skinned</a> heroes.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" received highly positive reviews, initially as a work for children, and later among a general audience as well. It won the <a href="Boston%20Globe%E2%80%93Horn%20Book%20Award">Boston Globe–Horn pageRank.Book Award</a> in 1969 and was one of the final recipients of the <a href="Lewis%20Carroll%20Shelf%20Award">Lewis Carroll Shelf Award</a> in 1979. Commenting on its wide influence, <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> called "A Wizard of Earthsea" one of the "wellsprings" of fantasy literature. Le Guin would later write five subsequent books that, together with "A Wizard of Earthsea", are referred to as the <a href="Earthsea">Earthsea Cycle</a>: "<a href="The%20Tombs%20of%20Atuan">The Tombs of Atuan</a>" (1971), "<a href="The%20Farthest%20Shore">The Farthest Shore</a>" (1972), "<a href="Tehanu">Tehanu</a>" (1990), "<a href="The%20Other%20Wind">The Other Wind</a>" (2001), and "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea">Tales from Earthsea</a>" (2001). <a href="George%20Slusser">George Slusser</a> has described the series as a "work of high style and imagination", while <a href="Amanda%20Craig">Amanda Craig</a> said "A Wizard of Earthsea" was "the most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever".

Early concepts for the Earthsea setting were developed in two short stories, "<a href="The%20Rule%20of%20Names">The Rule of Names</a>" (1964) and "<a href="The%20Word%20of%20Unbinding">The Word of Unbinding</a>" (1964), both published in "<a href="Fantastic%20%28magazine%29">Fantastic</a>". The stories were later collected in Le Guin's anthology "<a href="The%20Wind%27s%20Twelve%20Quarters">The Wind's Twelve Quarters</a>" (1975). Earthsea was also used as the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published. In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of <a href="Ruth%20Robbins">Ruth Robbins</a>, the illustrator of the book) asked Le Guin to try writing a book "for older kids", giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach. Le Guin had no previous experience specifically with the genre of young adult literature, which rose in prominence during the late 1960s. Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on "A Wizard of Earthsea". Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from. Le Guin later said that she chose the medium of fantasy, and the theme of coming of age, with her intended adolescent audience in mind.

The short stories published in 1964 introduced the world of <a href="Earthsea">Earthsea</a> and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin's <a href="Earthsea%20%28universe%29%23Magic%20in%20Earthsea">treatment of magic</a>. It also introduced Yevaud, a dragon who featured briefly in "A Wizard of Earthsea". Le Guin's depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> legends as well as <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. Her knowledge of myths and legends, as well as her familial interest in anthropology, have been described by scholar Donna White as allowing her to create "entire cultures" for the islands of Earthsea. The influence of Norse lore in particular can be seen in the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers. The influence of <a href="Taoism">Taoist thought</a> on Le Guin's writing is also visible in the idea of a cosmic "balance" in the universe of Earthsea.

Earthsea itself is an <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> or group of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is <a href="Pre-industrial%20society">preindustrial</a>, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned <a href="Karg">Karg</a>ish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.

The novel follows a young boy called <a href="Ged%20%28Earthsea%29">Duny</a> born on the island of Gont, nicknamed "Sparrowhawk". Discovering that the boy has great power in him, his aunt trains him in magic. When his village is attacked by Kargish invaders Duny uses his power to summon a fog to conceal his village. Hearing of this, the powerful mage <a href="Aihal">Ogion</a> takes him as an apprentice, giving him his "true name"—Ged. Ogion tries to teach Ged about the "equilibrium", the concept that magic can upset the natural order of the world if used improperly. In an attempt to impress a girl he meets, Ged searches Ogion's spell-books and inadvertently summons a strange shadow, which is banished by Ogion. Sensing Ged's impatience to learn, Ogion sends Ged to attend a school for wizards on the island of Roke.

At the school, Ged's skills inspire admiration among the teachers as well as students. He befriends an older student named Vetch, but generally remains aloof from his fellows. Another student, Jasper, acts condescendingly towards Ged and provokes the latter's proud nature. After Jasper needles Ged during a feast, Ged challenges him to a duel. He casts a powerful spell intended to raise the spirit of a dead woman, but the spell goes awry and releases a shadow creature, which attacks Ged and scars his face. The Archmage Nemmerle banishes the shadow and saves Ged's life, although it costs Nemmerle his own.

Ged spends many months healing before resuming his studies. The new Archmage, Gensher, describes the shadow as an ancient evil that wishes to <a href="demonic%20possession">possess Ged</a>, and warns him that the creature has no name. Ged eventually receives his wizards' staff, and takes up residence in the Ninety Isles, providing the villagers protection from the dragons that live nearby on Pendor, but discovers that he is being pursued by the shadow creature. He sails to Pendor, and uses his knowledge of the dragon's true name to threaten him. The dragon offers to tell Ged the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon will never threaten the archipelago.

Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, seeking advice from the stone of the Terrenon. He is attacked on the way by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, the lady of the castle, shows him the stone of Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but <a href="Shapeshifting">transforms</a> into a falcon and flies away.

Ged flies back to Ogion on Gont, who crafts a new staff for him. Contrary to Gensher, Ogion insists that all creatures have a name, and advises Ged to confront the shadow creature. Ged pursues the creature in a small sailboat, until it lures him into a fog and wrecks the boat on a <a href="reef">reef</a>. Ged recovers with the help of an elderly couple marooned on the island, who give Ged part of a broken bracelet as a gift. Ged patches his boat and escapes the island, pursuing the creature into the East Reach. On the island of Iffish he meets his friend Vetch, who insists on joining him. They journey east far beyond the last known lands before they finally come upon the shadow. Here Ged realizes that the shadow has always been a part of his own spirit. Naming it with his own name, he merges with the shadow creature, understanding and accepting it as part of himself, and thus healing himself.

The first edition of the book, published in 1968, was illustrated by Ruth Robbins. The cover illustration was in color, and the interior of the book contained a map of the archipelago of Earthsea. In addition, each chapter had a black-and-white illustration by Robbins, similar to a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> image. The images represented topics from each chapter; for instance, the very first image depicted the island of Gont, while the illustration for the chapter "The Dragon of Pendor" pictured a flying dragon. The image shown here depicts Ged sailing in his boat "Lookfar", and was used in the 10th chapter, "The Open Sea", in which Ged and Vetch travel from Iffish eastward past all known lands to confront the shadow creature.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" was first published in 1968 by <a href="Parnassus%20Press">Parnassus Press</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, a year before "<a href="The%20Left%20Hand%20of%20Darkness">The Left Hand of Darkness</a>", Le Guin's watershed work. It was a personal landmark for Le Guin, as it represented her first attempt at writing for children; she had written only a handful of other novels and short stories prior to its publication. The book was also her first attempt at writing <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a>, rather than science-fiction. "A Wizard of Earthsea" was the first of Le Guin's books to receive widespread critical attention, and has been described as her best known work, as part of the Earthsea series. The book has been released in numerous editions, including an illustrated <a href="Folio%20Society">Folio Society</a> edition released in 2015. It was also translated into a number of other languages. An omnibus edition of all of Le Guin's Earthsea works is planned to be released on the 50th anniversary of the publication of "A Wizard of Earthsea" in 2018.

Le Guin originally intended for "A Wizard of Earthsea" to be a standalone novel, but decided to write a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and "<a href="The%20Tombs%20of%20Atuan">The Tombs of Atuan</a>" was released in 1971. "<a href="The%20Farthest%20Shore">The Farthest Shore</a>" was written as a third volume after further consideration, and was published in 1972. "The Tombs of Atuan" tells of the story of Ged's attempt to make whole the ring of Erreth Akbe, half of which is buried in the tombs of Atuan in the Kargish lands, from where he must steal it. There, he meets the child priestess Tenar, on whom the book focuses. In "The Farthest Shore", Ged, who has become Archmage, tries to combat a dwindling of magic across Earthsea, accompanied by Arren, a young prince. The first three books are together seen as the "original trilogy"; in each of these, Ged is shown as trying to heal some imbalance in the world. They were followed by "<a href="Tehanu">Tehanu</a>" (1990), "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea">Tales from Earthsea</a>" (2001), and "<a href="The%20Other%20Wind">The Other Wind</a>" (2001), which are sometimes referred to as the "second trilogy".

Initial recognition for the book was from children's-book critics, among whom it garnered acclaim. "A Wizard of Earthsea" received an even more positive response in the United Kingdom when it was released there in 1971, which, according to White, reflected the greater admiration of British critics for children's fantasy. In her 1975 annotated collection "Fantasy for Children", British critic <a href="Naomi%20Lewis">Naomi Lewis</a> described it in the following terms: "[It is not] the easiest book for casual browsing, but readers who take the step will find themselves in one of the most important works of fantasy of our time." Similarly, literary scholar Margaret Esmonde wrote in 1981 that "Le Guin has ... enriched children's literature with what may be its finest high fantasy", while a review in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" by author and journalist <a href="Amanda%20Craig">Amanda Craig</a> said it was "The most thrilling, wise and beautiful children's novel ever, [written] in prose as taut and clean as a ship's sail." In discussing the book for a gathering of children's librarians <a href="Eleanor%20Cameron">Eleanor Cameron</a> praised the world building in the story, saying "it is as if [Le Guin] herself has lived on the archipelago." Author David Mitchell called the titular character Ged a "superb creation", and argued that he was a more relatable wizard than those featured in prominent works of fantasy at the time. According to him, characters such as <a href="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> were "variants on the archetype of Merlin, a Caucasian scholarly aristocrat amongst sorcerers" with little room to grow, whereas Ged developed as a character through his story. Mitchell also praised the other characters in the story, who he said seemed to have a "fully thought-out inner life" despite being fleeting presences. The 1995 "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" said that the Earthsea books had been considered the finest science fiction books for children in the post-World War II period.

Commentators have noted that the Earthsea novels in general received less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a>, describing it as "adult chauvinist piggery". In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'". Barbara Bucknall stated that "Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age." Only in later years did "A Wizard of Earthsea" receive attention from a more general audience. Literary scholar T. A. Shippey was among the first to treat "A Wizard of Earthsea" as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> and <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>, among others. Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as "a fantasy book for adults", and added that although the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as "life and mortality and who are we as human beings", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. The "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went "far beyond" the young adults for whom it was written. It went on to praise the book as "austere but vivid", and said the series was more thoughtful than the "<a href="Narnia">Narnia</a>" books by C. S. Lewis. In his 1980 history of fantasy, <a href="Brian%20Attebery">Brian Attebery</a> called the Earthsea trilogy "the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date". Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a "work of high style and imagination", and the original trilogy of books a product of "genuine epic vision". In 1974, critic <a href="Robert%20Scholes">Robert Scholes</a> compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, saying, "Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure." He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave. In 2014 David Pringle called it "a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound".

"A Wizard of Earthsea" won or contributed to several notable awards for Le Guin. It won the <a href="Boston%20Globe%E2%80%93Horn%20Book%20Award">Boston Globe–Horn pageRank.Book Award</a> in 1969, and was one of the last winners of the <a href="Lewis%20Carroll%20Shelf%20Award">Lewis Carroll Shelf Award</a> ten years later. In 1984 it won the "<a href="Zlota%20Sepulka">Zlota Sepulka</a>" or the "Golden Sepulka" () in Poland. In 2000 Le Guin was given the <a href="Margaret%20A.%20Edwards%20Award">Margaret A. Edwards Award</a> by the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a> for young adult literature. The award cited six of her works, including the first four Earthsea volumes, "The Left Hand of Darkness", and "<a href="The%20Beginning%20Place">The Beginning Place</a>". A 1987 poll in "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>" ranked "A Wizard of Earthsea" third among "All-Time Best Fantasy Novels", while in 2014 Pringle listed it at number 39 in his list of the 100 best novels in modern fantasy.

The book has been seen as widely influential within the genre of fantasy. <a href="Margaret%20Atwood">Margaret Atwood</a> has called "A Wizard of Earthsea" one of the "wellsprings" of fantasy literature, illustrating Le Guin's influence within the genre. "A Wizard of Earthsea" has been compared to major works of <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> such as <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" and <a href="L.%20Frank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>". The notion that names can exert power is also present in <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s 2001 film "<a href="Spirited%20Away">Spirited Away</a>"; critics have suggested that that idea originated with Le Guin's Earthsea series. Novelist <a href="David%20Mitchell%20%28author%29">David Mitchell</a>, author of books such as "<a href="Cloud%20Atlas%20%28novel%29">Cloud Atlas</a>", described "A Wizard of Earthsea" as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to "wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin".

Modern writers have credited "A Wizard of Earthsea" for introducing the idea of a "wizard school", which would later be made famous by the "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in "Harry Potter". Reviewers have also commented that the basic premise of "A Wizard of Earthsea", that of a talented boy going to a wizard's school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of "Harry Potter". Ged also receives a scar from the shadow, which hurts whenever the shadow is near him, just as Harry Potter's scar from <a href="Voldemort">Voldemort</a>. Commenting on the similarity, Le Guin said that she did not feel that <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> "ripped her off", but that Rowling's books received too much praise for supposed originality, and that Rowling "could have been more gracious about her predecessors. My incredulity was at the critics who found the first book wonderfully original. She has many virtues, but originality isn't one of them. That hurt."

"A Wizard of Earthsea" focuses on Ged's adolescence and coming of age, and along with the other two works of the original Earthsea trilogy forms a part of Le Guin's dynamic portrayal of the process of growing old. The three novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character. The novel is frequently described as a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>". <a href="Mike%20Cadden">Mike Cadden</a> stated that the book is a convincing tale "to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him". Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes through the novel.

Ged is depicted as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually realize that there is a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged begins his apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.

The passage at the end of the novel, wherein Ged finally accepts the shadow as a part of himself and is thus released from its terror, has been pointed to by reviewers as a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a>. Jeanne Walker, for example, wrote that the rite of passage at the end was an analogue for the entire plot of "A Wizard of Earthsea", and that the plot itself plays the role of a rite of passage for an adolescent reader. Walker goes on to say, "The entire action of A Wizard of Earthsea ... portrays the hero's slow realization of what it means to be an individual in society and a self in relation to higher powers. Many readers and critics have commented on similarities between Ged's process of growing up and ideas in <a href="Self%20in%20Jungian%20psychology">Jungian psychology</a>. The young Ged has a scary encounter with a <a href="Shadow%20%28psychology%29">shadow creature</a>, which he later realizes is the dark side of himself. It is only after he recognizes and merges with the shadow that he becomes a whole person. Le Guin claimed never to have read <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jung</a> before writing the Earthsea novels.

Le Guin described coming of age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose that theme since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that "Coming of age ... is a process that took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing coming of age, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.

The world of Earthsea is depicted as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea (implicit in the name Earthsea), and between people and their natural environment. In addition to physical equilibrium, there is a larger cosmic equilibrium, which everybody is aware of, and which wizards are tasked with maintaining. Describing this aspect of Earthsea, Elizabeth Cummins wrote, "The principle of balanced powers, the recognition that every act affects self, society, world, and cosmos, is both a physical and a moral principle of Le Guin's fantasy world." The concept of balance is related to the novel's other major theme of coming of age, as Ged's knowledge of the consequences of his own actions for good or ill is necessary for him to understand how the balance is maintained. While at the school of Roke, the Master Hand tells him: 

The influence of Taoism on Le Guin's writing is evident through much of the book, especially in her depiction of the "balance". At the end of the novel, Ged, may be seen to embody the Taoist way of life, as he has learned not to act unless absolutely necessary. He has also learned that seeming opposites, like light and dark or good and evil, are actually interdependent. Light and dark themselves are recurring images within the story. Reviewers have identified this belief as evidence of a conservative ideology within the story, shared with much of fantasy. In emphasizing concerns over balance and equilibrium, scholars have argued, Le Guin essentially justifies the status quo, which wizards strive to maintain. This tendency is in contrast to Le Guin's science fiction writing, in which change is shown to have value. 

The nature of human evil forms a significant related theme through "A Wizard of Earthsea" as well as the other Earthsea novels. As with other works by Le Guin, evil is shown as a misunderstanding of the balance of life. Ged is born with great power in him, but the pride that he takes in his power leads to his downfall; he tries to demonstrate his strength by bringing a spirit back from the dead, and in performing this act against the laws of nature, releases the shadow that attacks him. Slusser suggests that although he is provoked into performing dangerous spells first by the girl on Gont and then by Jasper, this provocation exists in Ged's mind. He is shown as unwilling to look within himself and see the pride that drives him to do what he does. When he accepts the shadow into himself, he also finally accepts responsibility for his own actions, and by accepting his own mortality he is able to free himself. His companion Vetch describes the moment by saying 

Thus, although there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil was not one of these powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature. Although evil is present in the books, it is a non-Christian understanding of evil: evil is a "misunderstanding of the dynamics of life". This is contrary to conventional Western storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict. On two different occasions, Ged is tempted to try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.

In Le Guin's fictional universe, to know the <a href="true%20name">true name</a> of an object or a person is to have power over it. Each child is given a true name when they reach puberty, a name which they share only with close friends. Several of the dragons in the later Earthsea novels, like Orm Embar and Kalessin, are shown as living openly with their names, which do not give anybody power over them. In "A Wizard of Earthsea", however, Ged is shown to have power over Yevaud. Cadden writes that this is because Yevaud still has attachment to riches and material possessions, and is thus bound by the power of his name. Wizards exert their influence over the equilibrium through the use of names, thus linking this theme to Le Guin's depiction of a cosmic balance. According to Cummins, this is Le Guin's way of demonstrating the power of language in shaping reality. Since language is the tool we use for communicating about the environment, she argues that it also allows humans to affect the environment, and the wizards' power to use names symbolizes this. Cummins went on to draw an analogy between the a wizard's use of names to change things with the creative use of words in fictional writing. Shippey wrote that Earthsea magic seems to work through what he called the "Rumpelstiltskin theory", in which names have power. He argued that this portrayal was part of Le Guin's effort to emphasize the power of words over objects, which, according to Shippey, was in contrast to the ideology of other fantasy writers, such as <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a> in "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>". Esmonde argued that each of the first three Earthsea books hinged on an act of trust. In "A Wizard of Earthsea", Vetch trusts Ged with his true name when the latter is at his lowest ebb emotionally, thus giving Ged complete power over himself. Ged later offers Tenar the same gift in "The Tombs of Atuan", thereby allowing her to learn trust.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" and other novels of the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin's early <a href="Hainish%20cycle">Hainish cycle</a> works, although they were written at a similar time. George Slusser described the Earthsea works as providing a counterweight to the "excessive pessimism" of the Hainish novels. He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as "<a href="Vaster%20than%20Empires%20and%20More%20Slow">Vaster than Empires and More Slow</a>". The "Encyclopedia of Science Fiction" said the book was pervaded by a "grave joyfulness". In discussing the style of her fantasy works, Le Guin herself said that in fantasy it was necessary to be clear and direct with language, because there is no known framework for the reader's mind to rest upon.

The story often appears to assume that readers are familiar with the geography and history of Earthsea, a technique which allowed Le Guin to avoid <a href="exposition%20%28narrative%29">exposition</a>: a reviewer wrote that this method "gives Le Guin's world the mysterious depths of Tolkien's, but without his tiresome back-stories and versifying". In keeping with the notion of an epic, the narration switches from looking ahead into Ged's future and looking back into the past of Earthsea. At the same time, Slusser described the mood of the novel as "strange and dreamlike", fluctuating between objective reality and the thoughts in Ged's mind; some of Ged's adversaries are real, while others are phantoms. This narrative technique, which Cadden characterizes as "free indirect discourse" makes the narrator of the book seem sympathetic to the protagonist, and does not distance his thoughts from the reader.

"A Wizard of Earthsea" has strong elements of an <a href="epic%20%28genre%29">epic</a>; for instance, Ged's place in Earthsea history is described at the very beginning of the book in the following terms: "some say the greatest, and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day became both dragonlord and Archmage." The story also begins with words from the Earthsea song "The Creation of Éa", which forms a ritualistic beginning to the book. The teller of the story then goes on to say that it is from Ged's youth, thereby establishing context for the rest of the book. In comparison with the protagonists of many of Le Guin's other works, Ged is superficially a typical hero, a mage who sets out on a quest. Reviewers have compared "A Wizard of Earthsea" to epics such as "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>". Scholar Virginia White argued that the story followed a structure common to epics in which the protagonist begins an adventure, faces trials along the way, and eventually returns in triumph. White went on to suggest that this structure can be seen in the series as a whole, as well as in the individual volumes.

Le Guin subverted many of the tropes typical to such "monomyths"; the protagonists of her story were all <a href="Person%20of%20color">dark-skinned</a>, in comparison to the <a href="White%20people">white-skinned</a> heroes more traditionally used; the Kargish antagonists, in contrast, were white-skinned, a switching of race roles that has been remarked upon by multiple critics. Critics have also cited her use of characters from multiple class backgrounds as a choice subversive to conventional Western fantasy. At the same time, reviewers questioned Le Guin's treatment of gender in "A Wizard of Earthsea", and the original trilogy as a whole. Le Guin, who later became known as a <a href="Feminism">feminist</a>, chose to restrict the use of magic to men and boys in the first volume of Earthsea. Initial critical reactions to "A Wizard of Earthsea" saw Ged's gender as incidental. In contrast, "The Tombs of Atuan" saw Le Guin intentionally tell a female coming-of-age story, which was nonetheless described as perpetuating a male-dominated model of Earthsea. "Tehanu" (1990), published as the fourth volume of "Earthsea" 18 years after the third, has been described both by Le Guin and her commentators as a feminist re-imagining of the series, in which the power and status of the chief characters are reversed, and the patriarchal social structure questioned. Commenting in 1993, Le Guin wrote that she could not continue [Earthsea after 1972] until she had "wrestled with the angels of the feminist consciousness".

Several critics have argued that by combining elements of epic, "Bildungsroman", and young adult fiction, Le Guin succeeded in blurring the boundaries of conventional genres. In an 1975 commentary Francis Molson argued that the series should be referred to as "ethical fantasy", a term which acknowledged that the story did not always follow the tropes of heroic fantasy, and the moral questions that it raised. The term did not become popular. A similar argument was made by children's literature critic Cordelia Sherman in 1985; she argued that "A Wizard of Earthsea" and the rest of the series sought "to teach children by dramatic example what it means to be a good adult".

A condensed, illustrated version of the first chapter was printed by <a href="World%20Books">World Books</a> in the third volume of "<a href="Childcraft">Childcraft</a>" in 1989. Multiple audio versions of the book have been released. BBC Radio produced a radioplay version in 1996 narrated by <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a>, and a six-part series adapting the Earthsea novels in 2015, broadcast on <a href="Radio%204%20Extra">Radio 4 Extra</a>. In 2011, the work was produced as an unabridged recording performed by <a href="Rob%20Inglis">Robert Inglis</a>.

Two screen adaptations of the story have also been produced. An original mini-series titled "<a href="Legend%20of%20Earthsea">Legend of Earthsea</a>" was broadcast in 2005 on the <a href="Syfy">Sci Fi Channel</a>. It is based very loosely on "A Wizard of Earthsea" and "The Tombs of Atuan". In an article published in "Salon", Le Guin expressed strong displeasure at the result. She stated that by casting a "petulant white kid" as Ged (who has red-brown skin in the book) the series "<a href="Whitewashing%20in%20film">whitewashed</a> Earthsea", and had ignored her choice to write the story of a non-white character, a choice she said was central to the book. This sentiment was shared by a review in "The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy", which said that "Legend of Earthsea" "totally missed the point" of Le Guin's novels, "ripping out all the subtlety, nuance and beauty of the books and inserting boring cliches, painful stereotypes and a very unwelcome 'epic' war in their place".

<a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> released an adaptation of the series in 2006 titled "<a href="Tales%20from%20Earthsea%20%28film%29">Tales from Earthsea</a>". The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, and in particular the use of a villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.

Alex Lifeson

Alexandar Zivojinovich, (born 27 August 1953), better known by his stage name Alex Lifeson, is a Canadian musician, best known as the guitarist of the Canadian rock band <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>. In 1968, Lifeson co-founded the band that would become Rush, with drummer <a href="John%20Rutsey">John Rutsey</a> and bassist and singer <a href="Jeff%20Jones%20%28musician%29">Jeff Jones</a>. Jones was replaced by <a href="Geddy%20Lee">Geddy Lee</a> a month later, and Rutsey was replaced by <a href="Neil%20Peart">Neil Peart</a> in 1974; the band's line-up has remained the same ever since.

With Rush, Lifeson plays electric and acoustic guitars, as well as other <a href="string%20instrument">string instrument</a>s such as <a href="mandola">mandola</a>, <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, and <a href="bouzouki">bouzouki</a>. He also performs backing vocals in live performances, and occasionally plays keyboards and bass pedal synthesizers. Like the other members of Rush, Lifeson performs real-time on-stage triggering of <a href="Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampled</a> instruments, concurrently with his guitar playing.

The bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, although Lifeson has contributed to a body of work outside of the band as well. Aside from music, Lifeson is part-owner of <a href="The%20Orbit%20Room">The Orbit Room</a>, a bar and restaurant in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, a painter and a licensed aircraft <a href="Aviator">pilot</a>.

Along with his bandmates <a href="Geddy%20Lee">Geddy Lee</a> and <a href="Neil%20Peart">Neil Peart</a>, Lifeson was made an Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> on 9 May 1996. The trio was the first rock band to be so honoured, as a group.

Lifeson was ranked 98th on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"'s list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, and third (after <a href="Eddie%20Van%20Halen">Eddie Van Halen</a> and <a href="Brian%20May">Brian May</a>) in a "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" readers poll also listing the 100 greatest guitarists.

Lifeson was born as Alexandar Zivojinovich (Aleksandar Živojinović in Serbian) in <a href="Fernie%2C%20British%20Columbia">Fernie</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, to Serbian immigrants, Nenad and Melanija Živojinović, and raised in Toronto, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. His stage name of "Lifeson" is a semi-literal translation of the surname <a href="%C5%BDivojinovi%C4%87">Živojinović</a>, which means "son of life" in Serbian. His first exposure to formal music training came in the form of the <a href="viola">viola</a>, which he renounced for the guitar at the age of 12. His first guitar was a Christmas gift from his father, a six-string Kent classical acoustic which was later upgraded to an electric Japanese model. During his adolescent years, he was influenced primarily by <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>, <a href="Steve%20Hackett">Steve Hackett</a>, and <a href="Allan%20Holdsworth">Allan Holdsworth</a>; he explained in 2011 that "Clapton's solos seemed a little easier and more approachable. I remember sitting at my record player and moving the needle back and forth to get the solo in 'Spoonful.' But there was nothing I could do with Hendrix." In 1963 Lifeson met future Rush drummer <a href="John%20Rutsey">John Rutsey</a> in school. Both interested in music, they decided to form a band. Lifeson was primarily a self-taught guitarist with the only formal instruction coming from a high school friend in 1971 who taught classical guitar lessons. This training lasted for roughly a year and a half.

Lifeson recalls what inspired him to play guitar in a 2008 interview:

Lifeson's first girlfriend, Charlene, gave birth to their eldest son, Justin, in October 1970, and they married in 1975. Their second son, Adrian, was born two years later. Adrian is also involved in music, and performed on two tracks from Lifeson's 1996 solo project, "Victor".

Lifeson's neighbour <a href="John%20Rutsey">John Rutsey</a> began experimenting on a rented drum kit. In 1963, Lifeson and Rutsey formed The Projection, which eventually became Rush in August 1968 following the recruitment of original bassist and vocalist <a href="Jeff%20Jones%20%28musician%29">Jeff Jones</a>. <a href="Geddy%20Lee">Geddy Lee</a>, a <a href="High%20school%20%28North%20America%29">high school</a> friend of Lifeson's, assumed this role soon after.

Instrumentally, Lifeson is renowned for his signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and the copious arsenal of equipment he has used over the years.

Rush was on hiatus for several years starting in 1997 owing to , and Lifeson had not picked up a guitar for at least a year following those events. However, after some work in his home studio and on various side projects, Lifeson returned to the studio with Rush to begin work on 2002's "Vapor Trails". "Vapor Trails" is the first Rush album since the 1970s to lack keyboards—as such, Lifeson used over 50 different guitars in what <a href="Shawn%20Hammond">Shawn Hammond</a> of "Guitar Player" called "his most rabid and experimental playing ever." Geddy Lee was amenable to leaving keyboards off the album due in part to Lifeson's ongoing concern about their use. Lifeson's approach to the guitar tracks for the album eschewed traditional guitar riffs and solos in favour of "tonality and harmonic quality."

During live performances, he is still responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass pedal synthesizers, and backing vocals.

While the bulk of Lifeson's work in music has been with Rush, Lifeson's first major outside work was his solo project, "<a href="Victor%20%28album%29">Victor</a>", released in 1996. "Victor" was attributed as a self-titled work (i.e. "Victor" is attributed as the "artist" as well as the "album title"). This was done deliberately as an alternative to issuing the album explicitly under Lifeson's name. The title track is from the <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BH.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a> poem, also entitled "Victor". Both son Adrian and wife Charlene also contributed to the album. A follow-up album, possibly including vocals by <a href="Sarah%20McLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a>, was rumoured in the late 1990s, but was apparently shelved due to Atlantic Records' lack of support for the first album.

Lifeson has also contributed to a body of work outside of his involvement with the band in the form of instrumental contributions to other musical outfits. He made a guest appearance on the 1985 <a href="Platinum%20Blonde%20%28band%29">Platinum Blonde</a> album "<a href="Alien%20Shores">Alien Shores</a>" performing guitar solos on the songs "Crying Over You" and "Holy Water". Later, in 1990, he appeared on <a href="Lawrence%20Gowan">Lawrence Gowan</a>'s album, "<a href="Lost%20Brotherhood">Lost Brotherhood</a>" to play guitar. In 1995, he guested on two tracks on <a href="Tom%20Cochrane">Tom Cochrane</a>'s "<a href="Ragged%20Ass%20Road">Ragged Ass Road</a>" album and then in 1996 on <a href="I%20Mother%20Earth">I Mother Earth</a>'s "Like a Girl" from the "<a href="Scenery%20and%20Fish">Scenery and Fish</a>" album. In 1997 he appeared on the "Merry Axemas: A Guitar Christmas" album. Lifeson played "the Little Drummer Boy" which was released as track 9 on the album. In 2006, Lifeson founded The <a href="Big%20Dirty%20Band">Big Dirty Band</a>, which he created for the purpose of providing original soundtrack material for "". Lifeson <a href="Jam%20session">jammed</a> regularly with The Dexters (<a href="The%20Orbit%20Room">The Orbit Room</a> house band from 1994 to 2004). Lifeson made a guest appearance on the 2007 album "<a href="Fear%20of%20a%20Blank%20Planet">Fear of a Blank Planet</a>" by UK progressive rock band, <a href="Porcupine%20Tree">Porcupine Tree</a>, contributing a solo during the song "<a href="Anesthetize">Anesthetize</a>". He also appeared on the 2008 album "<a href="Tiles%20%28band%29%23About%20%26quot%3BFly%20Paper%26quot%3B">Fly Paper</a>" by Detroit progressive rockers <a href="Tiles%20%28band%29">Tiles</a>. He plays on the track "Sacred and Mundane". Outside of band related endeavours, Lifeson composed the theme for the first season of the science-fiction TV series "<a href="Andromeda%20%28TV%20series%29">Andromeda</a>". He also produced 3 songs from the album "<a href="Away%20from%20the%20Sun">Away from the Sun</a>" by <a href="3%20Doors%20Down">3 Doors Down</a>.

Lifeson made his film debut as himself under his birth name in the 1972 Canadian documentary film "Come on Children".

In a 2003 episode of the Canadian <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> "<a href="Trailer%20Park%20Boys">Trailer Park Boys</a>", titled "<a href="Closer%20to%20the%20Heart">Closer to the Heart</a>", Lifeson plays a partly fictional version of himself. In the story, he is kidnapped by <a href="Robb%20Wells">Ricky</a> and held as punishment for his inability (or refusal) to provide the main characters with free tickets to a Rush concert. In the end of the episode, Alex reconciles with the characters, and performs a duet of "Closer to the Heart" with <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28actor%29">Bubbles</a> at the trailer park. In 2006, Lifeson appeared in "" as a traffic cop in the opening scene and in 2009 he appeared in their follow up movie, "", as an undercover vice cop in drag.

In 2008, Lifeson and the rest of Rush played "Tom Sawyer" at the end of an episode of "<a href="The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</a>". According to Colbert, this was their first appearance on American television as a band in 33 years.

In 2009, he and the rest of the band appeared as themselves in the comedy "<a href="I%20Love%20You%2C%20Man">I Love You, Man</a>".

Alex Lifeson appears as the border guard in the 2009 movie "Suck".

The role of Dr. Funtime in "<a href="The%20Drunk%20and%20On%20Drugs%20Happy%20Funtime%20Hour">The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour</a>" was originally written with Alex Lifeson in mind, but due to scheduling conflicts the role was given to <a href="Maury%20Chaykin">Maury Chaykin</a> instead.

On <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve%23United%20States">New Year's Eve</a> 2003, Lifeson, his son, and his daughter-in-law were arrested at the <a href="Ritz-Carlton">Ritz-Carlton</a> hotel in <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples, Florida</a>. Lifeson, after intervening in an altercation between his son and police, was accused of assaulting a sheriff's deputy in what was described as a drunken brawl. In addition to suffering a broken nose at the hands of the officers, Lifeson was <a href="taser">tased</a> six times. His son was also tased repeatedly.

On 21 April 2005, Lifeson and his son agreed to a plea deal with the local <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a> for the <a href="State%27s%20Attorney">State's Attorney</a> office to avoid jail time by pleading <a href="nolo%20contendere">no contest</a> to a first-degree <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> charge of resisting arrest without violence. As part of the plea agreement Lifeson and his son were each sentenced to 12 months of probation with the adjudication of that probation suspended. Lifeson acknowledged his subsequent legal action against both the Ritz-Carlton and the Collier County Sheriff's Office for "their incredibly discourteous, arrogant and aggressive behaviour of which I had never experienced in thirty years of travel." Although both actions were initially dismissed in April 2007, legal claims against the Ritz-Carlton were reinstated upon appeal, and ultimately settled out of court in August 2008, with Lifeson and his son agreeing to a confidential settlement from Ritz-Carlton.

In his journal-based book "Roadshow", Peart relates the band's perspective on the events of that New Year's Eve.

In Rush's early career, Lifeson used a <a href="Gibson%20ES-335">Gibson ES-335</a> for the first tour, and in 1976 bought a 1974 <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul">Gibson Les Paul</a>; he used those two guitars until the late 1970s. He had a <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> with a <a href="Bill%20Lawrence%20%28guitar%20maker%29">Bill Lawrence</a> humbucker and <a href="Floyd%20Rose">Floyd Rose</a> vibrato bridge as backup "and for a different sound." For the "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Kings">A Farewell to Kings</a>" sessions, Lifeson began using a <a href="Gibson%20EDS-1275">Gibson EDS-1275</a> for songs like "<a href="Xanadu%20%28Rush%20song%29">Xanadu</a>" and his main guitar became a white <a href="Gibson%20ES-355">Gibson ES-355</a>. During this period Lifeson used <a href="Hiwatt">Hiwatt</a> amplifiers. He played a <a href="Gibson%20B%20series%23B-45">twelve-string Gibson B-45</a> on songs like "<a href="Closer%20to%20the%20Heart">Closer to the Heart</a>."

From 1980 to 1986, Lifeson used four identically modified Stratocasters, all of them equipped with the Floyd Rose bridge. As a joke, he called these Hentor Sportscasters – a made-up name inspired by Peter Henderson's name, who was the producer of "<a href="Grace%20Under%20Pressure%20%28Rush%20album%29">Grace Under Pressure</a>". He also played a Gibson Howard Roberts Fusion. By 1987, Lifeson switched to Signature guitars (Canadian-made) which, while "awful to play—very uncomfortable--...had a particular sound I liked." Lifeson primarily used <a href="PRS%20Guitars">PRS guitars</a> in the later-half of the 1990 Presto tour, and again during the recording of "<a href="Roll%20The%20Bones">Roll The Bones</a>" in 1990/1991. He would continue to play PRS for the next sixteen years through the recording and touring of "<a href="Counterparts%20%28album%29">Counterparts</a>", "<a href="Test%20for%20Echo">Test for Echo</a>" and "<a href="Vapor%20Trails">Vapor Trails</a>" as well as the R30 tour.

In 2011, Lifeson said that for the past few years he ""...used Gibson almost exclusively. There's nothing like having a low-slung Les Paul over my shoulder.""

In early 2011, Gibson introduced the "Alex Lifeson Axcess", a guitar specially designed for him. These are custom made Les Pauls with <a href="Floyd%20Rose">Floyd Rose tremolo</a> systems and <a href="Pickup%20%28music%20technology%29%23Piezoelectric%20pickups">piezoacoustic pick-ups</a>. He used these two custom Les Pauls on the <a href="Time%20Machine%20Tour">Time Machine Tour</a>. These guitars are also available through Gibson, in a viceroy Brown or Crimson colour. Lifeson used these two guitars heavily on the tour.

For the 2012-2013 <a href="Clockwork%20Angels%20tour">Clockwork Angels tour</a>, Gibson built an Alex Lifeson Axcess model in black which became Lifeson's primary guitar for much of the show. For all acoustic work, he played one of his Axcess guitars using the piezo pick-ups; no acoustic guitars were used at all in the Clockwork Angels show.

For the 2015 R40 Tour, Lifeson used his signature acoustic guitar model by <a href="PRS%20Guitars">Paul Reed Smith</a>. The guitar is currently available for private stock order.

Gibson introduced an Alex Lifeson R40 Les Paul Axcess signature guitar in June 2015. This is a limited edition with 50 guitars signed and played by Lifeson, and another 250 available without the signature.

In 2005, Hughes & Kettner introduced an Alex Lifeson signature series amplifier; Lifeson donates his royalties from the sale of these signature models to <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>.

In 2012, Lifeson abandoned his signature Triamps in favour for custom-built Lerxst Omega <a href="Marshall%20Amplification">Silver Jubilee</a> clones, handmade by Mojotone in Burgaw, NC and <a href="Mesa%20Boogie%20Mark%20Series">Mesa/Boogie Mark V</a> heads. He still uses the Hughes & Kettner Coreblades.

For <a href="effects%20unit">effects</a>, Lifeson is known to use <a href="chorus%20effect">chorus</a>, <a href="phase%20shifting">phase shifting</a>, and <a href="flanger">flanging</a>. Throughout his career, he has used well-known pedals such as the <a href="Electro-Harmonix">Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress</a> flanger, the <a href="Boss%20Corporation">BOSS CE-1</a> chorus, the <a href="Dunlop%20crybaby">Dunlop crybaby</a> wah, among others.

Lifeson and his guitar technician <a href="Scott%20Appleton%20%28guitar%20technician%29">Scott Appleton</a> have discussed in interviews Lifeson's use of <a href="Fractal%20Audio">Fractal Audio</a>'s Axe-FX, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>'s <a href="Mainstage%20%28software%29">MainStage</a>, and <a href="Native%20Instruments">Native Instruments</a>' Guitar Rig.

In addition to acoustic and electric guitars, Lifeson has also played <a href="mandola">mandola</a>, <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and <a href="bouzouki">bouzouki</a> on recent Rush studio albums, including "<a href="Test%20for%20Echo">Test for Echo</a>", "<a href="Vapor%20Trails">Vapor Trails</a>" and "<a href="Snakes%20%26amp%3B%20Arrows">Snakes & Arrows</a>".

During live Rush performances, Lifeson uses <a href="MIDI%20controller">MIDI controller</a>s that enables him to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds from <a href="sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">digital samplers</a> and <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s, without taking his hands off his guitar. (Prior to this, Lifeson used <a href="Moog%20Taurus">Moog Taurus</a> Bass Pedals before they were replaced by Korg MIDI pedals in the 1980s.) Lifeson and his bandmates share a desire to accurately depict songs from their albums when playing live performances. Toward this goal, beginning in the late 1980s the band equipped their live performances with a capacious rack of samplers. The band members use these samplers in real-time to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a>s, vocal <a href="harmonies">harmonies</a>, and other sound "events" that are familiarly heard on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members share duties throughout most songs, with each member triggering certain sounds with his available limbs, while playing his primary instrument(s).

Some artists have cited Lifeson as an influence, including <a href="Paul%20Gilbert">Paul Gilbert</a> of <a href="Mr.%20Big%20%28American%20band%29">Mr. Big</a>, <a href="John%20Petrucci">John Petrucci</a> of <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a>, <a href="Steven%20Wilson">Steven Wilson</a> of <a href="Porcupine%20Tree">Porcupine Tree</a>, <a href="Denis%20%26quot%3BPiggy%26quot%3B%20D%27Amour">Denis "Piggy" D'Amour</a> of <a href="Voivod%20%28band%29">Voivod</a> and <a href="John%20Wesley%20%28guitarist%29">John Wesley</a>.

File archiver

A file archiver is a <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a> that combines a number of <a href="computer%20file">files</a> together into one <a href="archive%20file">archive file</a>, or a series of archive files, for easier transportation or storage. File archivers may employ <a href="lossless%20data%20compression">lossless data compression</a> in their <a href="archive%20format">archive format</a>s to reduce the size of the archive.

Basic archivers just take a list of files and concatenate their contents sequentially into archives. The archive files need to store <a href="metadata">metadata</a>, at least the names and lengths of the original files, if proper reconstruction is possible. More advanced archivers store additional metadata, such as the <a href="Timestamping%20%28computing%29">original timestamps</a>, <a href="file%20attribute">file attribute</a>s or <a href="access%20control%20list">access control list</a>s.

The process of making an archive file is called "archiving" or "packing". Reconstructing the original files from the archive is termed "unarchiving", "unpacking" or "extracting".

An early archiver was the <a href="Multics">Multics</a> command "archive", descended from the <a href="Compatible%20Time-Sharing%20System">CTSS</a> command of the same name, which was a basic archiver and performed no compression. Multics also had a "tape_archiver" command, abbreviated "ta", which was perhaps the forerunner of unix' "tar".

The <a href="Unix">Unix</a> tools "<a href="ar%20%28Unix%29">ar</a>", "<a href="tar%20%28file%20format%29">tar</a>", "<a href="cpio">cpio</a>" act as archivers but not compressors. Users of the Unix tools use additional compression tools, such as <a href="gzip">gzip</a>, <a href="bzip2">bzip2</a>, or <a href="xz">xz</a>, to compress the archive file after packing or remove compression before unpacking the archive file. The <a href="filename%20extension">filename extension</a>s are successively added at each step of this process. For example, archiving a collection of files with "tar" and then compressing the resulting archive file with "gzip" results a file with codice_1 extension.

This approach has two goals:

This approach, however, has disadvantages too:

The built-in archiver of <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> as well as third-party archiving software, such as <a href="WinRAR">WinRAR</a> and <a href="7-zip">7-zip</a>, often use a <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>. They also offer an optional <a href="command-line%20interface">command-line interface</a>, while Windows itself does not. Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression. <a href="Solid%20compression">Solid compression</a> may or may not be offered, depending on the product: Windows itself does not support it; WinRAR and 7-zip offer it as an option that can be turned on or off.

Artemis

Artemis (; "Artemis", ) was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities. Her <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> equivalent is <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>. Some scholars believe that the name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek. Homer refers to her as "Artemis Agrotera, <a href="Potnia%20Theron">Potnia Theron</a>": "Artemis of the wildland, Mistress of Animals". The <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>ns believed she was the daughter of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a>.

In the classical period of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Artemis was often described as the daughter of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Leto">Leto</a>, and the twin sister of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. She was the Hellenic goddess of the <a href="Hunting">hunt</a>, <a href="Wildlife">wild animals</a>, <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a>, <a href="childbirth">childbirth</a>, <a href="virginity">virginity</a> and protector of young girls, bringing and relieving disease in women; she often was depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows. The <a href="deer">deer</a> and the <a href="Cupressus">cypress</a> were sacred to her. In later Hellenistic times, she even assumed the ancient role of <a href="Eileithyia">Eileithyia</a> in aiding childbirth.

The name Artemis (<a href="Proper%20noun">"noun"</a>, <a href="Gender%20%28linguistics%29">"feminine"</a>) is of unknown or uncertain origin and etymology although various ones have been proposed.

For example, according to <a href="Johann%20Theodor%20Jablonski">J. T. Jablonski</a>, the name is also <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>n and could be "compared with the royal appellation "Artemas" of <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>. According to <a href="Charles%20Anthon">Charles Anthon</a> the primitive root of the name is probably of Persian origin from *"arta", *"art", *"arte", all meaning "great, excellent, holy," thus Artemis "becomes identical with the great mother of Nature, even as she was worshipped at Ephesus". Anton Goebel "suggests the root στρατ or ῥατ, "to shake," and makes Artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter".

The name could also be possibly related to <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "árktos" "<a href="bear">bear</a>" (from <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">PIE</a> *"h₂ŕ̥tḱos"), supported by the bear cult that the goddess had in <a href="Attica">Attica</a> (<a href="Brauronia%23Cult%20of%20Artemis%20Brauronia">Brauronia</a>) and the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> remains at the <a href="Arkoudiotissa%20Cave">Arkoudiotissa Cave</a>, as well as the story about <a href="Callisto%20%28mythology%29">Callisto</a>, which was originally about Artemis (<a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>n epithet "kallisto"); this cult was a survival of very old totemic and shamanistic rituals and formed part of a larger <a href="bear%20worship">bear cult</a> found further afield in other <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European</a> cultures (e.g., Gaulish <a href="Artio">Artio</a>). It is believed that a precursor of Artemis was worshipped in <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan Crete</a> as the goddess of mountains and hunting, <a href="Britomartis">Britomartis</a>. While connection with <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n names has been suggested, the earliest attested forms of the name "Artemis" are the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a> , "a-te-mi-to" /Artemitos/ and , "a-ti-mi-te" /Artimitei/, written in <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> at <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a>. <a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">R. S. P. Beekes</a> suggested that the "e"/"i" interchange points to a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> origin. Artemis was venerated in <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> as "Artimus". <a href="Georgios%20Babiniotis">Georgios Babiniotis</a>, while accepting that the etymology is unknown, also states that the name is already attested in Mycenean Greek and is possibly of pre-Greek origin.

Ancient Greek writers, by way of <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>, and some modern scholars, have linked Artemis (Doric "Artamis") to ἄρταμος, "artamos", i.e. "butcher" or, like <a href="Plato">Plato</a> did in "<a href="Cratylus%20%28dialogue%29">Cratylus</a>", to , "artemḗs", i.e. "safe", "unharmed", "uninjured", "pure", "the stainless maiden".

Various conflicting accounts are given in Classical Greek mythology regarding the birth of Artemis and Apollo, her twin brother. However, in terms of parentage, all accounts agree that she was the daughter of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Leto">Leto</a> and that she was the twin sister of Apollo.

An account by <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a> has it that Hera forbade Leto to give birth on either terra firma (the mainland) or on an island. Hera was angry with her husband Zeus because he had impregnated Leto but the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a> (or <a href="Ortygia">Ortygia</a> in the <a href="Homeric%20Hymn">Homeric Hymn</a> to Artemis) disobeyed Hera and Leto gave birth there.

In ancient Cretan history Leto was worshipped at <a href="Phaistos">Phaistos</a> and in Cretan mythology, Leto gave birth to Apollo and Artemis on the islands known today as <a href="Paximadia%20%28islands%29">Paximadia</a>.

A "<a href="scholium">scholium</a>" of <a href="Servius">Servius</a> on "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" iii. 72 accounts for the island's archaic name Ortygia by asserting that Zeus transformed Leto into a <a href="quail">quail</a> ("ortux") in order to prevent Hera from finding out about his infidelity, and Kenneth McLeish suggested further that in quail form Leto would have given birth with as few birth-pains as a mother quail suffers when it lays an egg.

The myths also differ as to whether Artemis was born first, or Apollo. Most stories depict Artemis as born first, becoming her mother's midwife upon the birth of her brother Apollo.

The childhood of Artemis is not fully related in any surviving myth. The "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" reduced the figure of the dread goddess to that of a girl, who, having been thrashed by <a href="Hera">Hera</a>, climbs weeping into the lap of Zeus. A poem of <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a> to the goddess "who amuses herself on mountains with archery" imagines some charming vignettes: according to Callimachus, at the age of three years, Artemis, while sitting on the knee of her father, Zeus, asked him to grant her six wishes: to remain always a virgin; to have many names to set her apart from her brother <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>; to be the Phaesporia or Light Bringer; to have a bow and arrow and a knee-length tunic so that she could hunt; to have sixty "daughters of <a href="Okeanos">Okeanos</a>", all nine years of age, to be her choir; and for twenty Amnisides Nymphs as handmaidens to watch her dogs and bow while she rested. She wished for no city dedicated to her, but to rule the mountains and for the ability to help women in the pains of childbirth.

Artemis believed that she had been chosen by <a href="Moirai">the Fates</a> to be a midwife, particularly since she had assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin brother, Apollo. All of her companions remained virgins, and Artemis closely guarded her own chastity. Her symbols included the golden bow and arrow, the hunting dog, the stag, and the moon. Callimachus tells how Artemis spent her girlhood seeking out the things that she would need to be a huntress, how she obtained her bow and arrows from the isle of <a href="Lipari">Lipara</a>, where <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> and the <a href="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> worked.

Oceanus' daughters were filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely approached and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a>, the god of the forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer to pull her chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.

As a virgin, Artemis had interested many gods and men, but only her hunting companion, <a href="Orion%20%28mythology%29">Orion</a>, won her heart. Orion was accidentally killed either by Artemis or by Gaia.

<a href="Alpheus%20%28mythology%29">Alpheus</a>, a river god, was in love with Artemis, but he realizes that he can do nothing to win her heart. So he decides to capture her. Artemis, who is with her companions at Letrenoi, goes to Alpheus, but, suspicious of his motives, she covers her face with mud so that the river god does not recognize her. In another story, Alphaeus tries to rape Artemis' attendant <a href="Arethusa%20%28mythology%29">Arethusa</a>. Artemis pities Arethusa and saves her by transforming Arethusa into a spring in Artemis' temple, <a href="Artemis%20Alphaea">Artemis Alphaea</a> in Letrini, where the goddess and her attendant drink.

Bouphagos, the son of the Titan Iapetus, sees Artemis and thinks about raping her. Reading his sinful thoughts, Artemis strikes him at Mount Pholoe.

Siproites is a boy, who, either because he accidentally sees Artemis bathing or because he attempts to rape her, is turned into a girl by the goddess.

Multiple versions of the Actaeon myth survive, though many are fragmentary. The details vary but at the core, they involve a great hunter, <a href="Actaeon">Actaeon</a> who Artemis turns into a stag for a transgression and who is then killed by hunting dogs. Usually, the dogs are his own, who no longer recognize their master. Sometimes they are Artemis' hounds.

According to the standard modern text on the work, Lamar Ronald Lacey's "The Myth of Aktaion: Literary and Iconographic Studies", the most likely original version of the myth is that Actaeon was the hunting companion of the goddess who, seeing her naked in her sacred spring, attempts to force himself on her. For this hubris, he is turned into a stag and devoured by his own hounds. However, in some surviving versions, Actaeon is a stranger who happens upon her. Different tellings also diverge in the hunter's transgression, which is sometimes merely seeing the virgin goddess naked, sometimes boasting he is a better hunter than she, or even merely being a rival of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> for the affections of <a href="Semele">Semele</a>.

In some versions of the story of <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>, who was a late addition to Greek mythology during the Hellenistic period, Artemis sent a <a href="Boar">wild boar</a> to kill Adonis as punishment for his hubristic boast that he was a better hunter than her.

In other versions, Artemis killed Adonis for revenge. In later myths, Adonis had been related as a favorite of <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, and Aphrodite was responsible for the death of <a href="Hippolytus%20%28mythology%29%23Hippolytus%20as%20Virbius">Hippolytus</a>, who had been a favorite of Artemis. Therefore, Artemis killed Adonis to avenge Hippolytus’s death.

In yet another version, Adonis was not killed by Artemis, but by Ares, as punishment for being with Aphrodite.

<a href="Orion%20%28mythology%29">Orion</a> was Artemis' hunting companion. In some versions, he is killed by Artemis, while in others he is killed by a <a href="Scorpius%23Mythology">scorpion</a> sent by <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a>. In some versions, Orion tries to seduce Opis, one of Artemis' followers, and she kills him. In a version by <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a>, Orion takes hold of Artemis' robe and she kills him in <a href="self-defense">self-defense</a>.

In yet another version, Apollo sends the scorpion. According to <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Hyginus</a> Artemis once loved Orion (in spite of the late source, this version appears to be a rare remnant of her as the pre-Olympian goddess, who took consorts, as <a href="Eos">Eos</a> did), but was tricked into killing him by her brother Apollo, who was "protective" of his sister's maidenhood.

The twin sons of <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and <a href="Iphidemia">Iphidemia</a>, Otos and Ephialtes, grew enormously at a young age. They were aggressive, great hunters, and could not be killed unless they killed each other. The growth of the <a href="Aloadae">Aloadae</a> never stopped, and they boasted that as soon as they could reach heaven, they would kidnap Artemis and <a href="Hera">Hera</a> and take them as wives. The gods were afraid of them, except for Artemis who captured a fine deer (or in another version of the story, she changed herself into a doe) and jumped out between them. The Aloadae threw their spears and so mistakenly killed each other.

<a href="Callisto%20%28mythology%29">Callisto</a> was the daughter of Lycaon, King of Arcadia and also was one of Artemis's hunting attendants. As a companion of Artemis, she took a vow of chastity. Zeus appeared to her disguised as Artemis, or in some stories Apollo gained her confidence and took advantage of her or, according to <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, raped her. As a result of this encounter, she conceived a son, Arcas.

Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some accounts say both) changed her into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out of pity, Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a> and <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> constellations.

Artemis punished <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a> after he killed a sacred stag in a <a href="sacred%20grove">sacred grove</a> and boasted that he was a better hunter than the goddess. When the Greek fleet was preparing at <a href="Aulis%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Aulis</a> to depart for <a href="Troy">Troy</a> to begin the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, Artemis becalmed the winds. The seer <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> advised Agamemnon that the only way to appease Artemis was to sacrifice his daughter <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>. Artemis then snatched Iphigenia from the altar and substituted a deer. Various myths have been told about what happened after Artemis took her. Either she was brought to Tauros and led the priests there or became Artemis' immortal companion.

A Queen of <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> and wife of <a href="Amphion">Amphion</a>, <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a> boasted of her superiority to Leto because while she had fourteen children (<a href="Niobids">Niobids</a>), seven boys and seven girls, Leto had only one of each. When Artemis and Apollo heard this impiety, Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, and Artemis shot her daughters, who died instantly without a sound. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions two of the Niobids were spared, one boy and one girl. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, killed himself. A devastated Niobe and her remaining children were turned to stone by Artemis as they wept. The gods themselves entombed them.

Chione was a princess of Pokis. She was beloved by two gods, <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> and <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, and boasted that she was prettier than Artemis because she made two gods fall in love with her at once. Artemis was furious and killed Chione with her arrow or struck her dumb by shooting off her tongue. However, some versions of this myth say Apollo and Hermes protected her from Artemis' wrath.

Artemis saved the infant <a href="Atalanta">Atalanta</a> from dying of exposure after her father abandoned her. She sent a female bear to suckle the baby, who was then raised by hunters. But she later sent a bear to hurt Atalanta because people said Atalanta was a better hunter. This is in some stories.

Among other adventures, Atalanta participated in the hunt for the <a href="Calydonian%20Boar">Calydonian Boar</a>, which Artemis had sent to destroy <a href="Calydon">Calydon</a> because King <a href="Oeneus">Oeneus</a> had forgotten her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. She hung it in a sacred grove at <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a> as a dedication to Artemis.

<a href="Meleager">Meleager</a> was a hero of Aetolia. King <a href="Oeneus">Oeneus</a> had him gather heroes from all over Greece to hunt the <a href="Calydonian%20Boar">Calydonian Boar</a>. After the death of <a href="Meleager">Meleager</a>, Artemis turned his grieving sisters, the <a href="Meleagrids">Meleagrids</a> into <a href="guineafowl">guineafowl</a> that Artemis loved very much.

In <a href="Nonnus">Nonnus</a> "<a href="Dionysiaca">Dionysiaca</a>", <a href="Aura%20%28mythology%29">Aura</a> was Greek goddess of breezes and cool air, daughter of <a href="Lelantos">Lelantos</a> and <a href="Periboia">Periboia</a>. She was a virgin huntress, just like Artemis and proud of her maidenhood. One day, she claimed that the body of Artemis was too womanly and she doubted her virginity. Artemis asked <a href="Nemesis%20%28mythology%29">Nemesis</a> for help to avenge her dignity and caused the rape of Aura by <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. Aura became a mad and dangerous killer. When she bore twin sons, she ate one of them while the other one, Iakhos, was saved by Artemis. Iakhos later became an attendant of <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a> and the leader of <a href="Eleusinian%20Mysteries">Eleusinian Mysteries</a>.

<a href="Polyphonte">Polyphonte</a> was a young woman who fled home preferring the idea of a virginal life with Artemis to the conventional life of marriage and children favoured by Aphrodite. As a punishment Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately the entire family were transformed into birds and more specifically ill portents for mankind.

Artemis may have been represented as a supporter of Troy because her brother <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> was the patron god of the city and she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times. In the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" she came to blows with Hera, when the divine allies of the Greeks and Trojans engaged each other in conflict. Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own quiver, causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.

Artemis played quite a large part in this war. Like her mother and brother, who was widely worshipped at Troy, Artemis took the side of the Trojans. At the Greek's journey to Troy, Artemis becalmed the sea and stopped the journey until an oracle came and said they could win the goddess' heart by sacrificing <a href="Iphigenia">Iphigenia</a>, <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>'s daughter. Agamemnon once promised the goddess he would sacrifice the dearest thing to him, which was Iphigenia, but broke that promise. Other sources said he boasted about his hunting ability and provoked the goddess' anger. Artemis saved Iphigenia because of her bravery. In some versions of the myth, Artemis made Iphigenia her attendant or turned her into <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a>, goddess of night, witchcraft, and the underworld.

<a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a> was helped by Artemis, Leto, and Apollo. Apollo found him wounded by Diomedes and lifted him to heaven. There, the three of them secretly healed him in a great chamber.

Artemis, the goddess of forests and hills, was worshipped throughout <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>. Her best known <a href="Cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cults</a> were on the island of <a href="Delos">Delos</a>
(her birthplace), in Attica at <a href="Brauron">Brauron</a> and Mounikhia (near <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>), and in <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>. She was often depicted in paintings and statues in a forest setting, carrying a bow and arrows and accompanied by a deer.

The ancient Spartans used to sacrifice to her as one of their patron goddesses before starting a new <a href="military%20campaign">military campaign</a>.

<a href="Athenian%20festivals">Athenian festivals</a> in honor of Artemis included <a href="Elaphebolia">Elaphebolia</a>, <a href="Mounikhia">Mounikhia</a>, Kharisteria, and <a href="Brauronia">Brauronia</a>. The festival of <a href="Artemis%20Orthia">Artemis Orthia</a> was observed in <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

Pre-pubescent and adolescent Athenian girls were sent to the sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron to serve the Goddess for one year. During this time, the girls were known as "arktoi", or little she-bears. A myth explaining this servitude states that a bear had formed the habit of regularly visiting the town of Brauron, and the people there fed it, so that, over time, the bear became tame. A girl teased the bear, and, in some versions of the myth, it killed her, while, in other versions, it clawed out her eyes. Either way, the girl's brothers killed the bear, and Artemis was enraged. She demanded that young girls "act the bear" at her sanctuary in atonement for the bear's death.

Virginal Artemis was worshipped as a fertility/childbirth goddess in some places, assimilating <a href="Ilithyia">Ilithyia</a>, since, according to some myths, she assisted her mother in the delivery of her twin. During the <a href="classical%20antiquity">Classical period</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, she was identified with <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a>. Artemis also assimilated <a href="Caryatis">Caryatis</a> (<a href="Carya%20%28goddess%29">Carya</a>).

As Aeginaea, she was worshipped in <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>; the name means either huntress of <a href="chamois">chamois</a>, or the wielder of the javelin ().
Also in Sparta, Artemis "Lygodesma" was worshipped. This epithet means "willow-bound" from the Gr. "lygos" (λυγός, willow) and "desmos" (δεσμός, bond). The <a href="willow%20tree">willow tree</a> appears in several ancient Greek myths and rituals.

She was worshipped at <a href="Naupactus">Naupactus</a> as Aetole; in her temple in that town there was a statue of white marble representing her throwing a javelin. This "Aetolian Artemis" would not have been introduced at Naupactus, anciently a place of <a href="Ozolian%20Locris">Ozolian Locris</a>, until it was awarded to the <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a>ns by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>. Strabo records another precinct of "Aetolian Artemos" at the head of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a>. As <a href="Agoraea">Agoraea</a> she was the protector of the <a href="agora">agora</a>.

As <a href="Agrotera">Agrotera</a>, she was especially associated as the patron goddess of hunters. In Athens Artemis was often associated with the local <a href="Aegina">Aeginian</a> goddess, <a href="Aphaea">Aphaea</a>. As <a href="Potnia%20Theron">Potnia Theron</a>, she was the patron of wild animals; <a href="Homer">Homer</a> used this title. As <a href="Kourotrophos">Kourotrophos</a>, she was the nurse of youths. As Locheia, she was the goddess of childbirth and midwives.

She was sometimes known as <a href="Cynthia">Cynthia</a>, from her birthplace on <a href="Cynthus">Mount Cynthus</a> on <a href="Delos">Delos</a>, or Amarynthia from a festival in her honor originally held at Amarynthus in <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>.

She was sometimes identified by the name <a href="Phoebe%20%28mythological%20characters%29">Phoebe</a>, the feminine form of her brother Apollo's solar epithet <a href="Phoebus">Phoebus</a>.

Alphaea, Alpheaea, or Alpheiusa (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Gr.</a> , , or ) was an epithet that Artemis derived from the river god <a href="Alpheus%20%28mythology%29">Alpheius</a>, who was said to have been in love with her. It was under this name that she was worshipped at Letrini in <a href="Elis">Elis</a>, and in <a href="Ortygia">Ortygia</a>. Artemis Alphaea was associated with the wearing of masks, largely because of the legend that while fleeing the advances of Alpheius, she and her <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s escaped him by covering their faces.

As Artemis Anaitis, the 'Persian Artemis' was identified with <a href="Anahita">Anahita</a>. As <a href="Apanchomene">Apanchomene</a>, she was worshipped as a hanged goddess.

Artemis was born on the sixth day, which made it sacred for her.

The oldest representations of Artemis in Greek Archaic art portray her as "<a href="Potnia%20Theron">Potnia Theron</a>" ("Queen of the Beasts"): a winged goddess holding a stag and leopard in her hands, or sometimes a leopard and a lion. This winged Artemis lingered in ex-votos as <a href="Artemis%20Orthia">Artemis Orthia</a>, with a sanctuary close by <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

In Greek classical art she is usually portrayed as a maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows. Often, she is shown in the shooting pose, and is accompanied by a <a href="hunting%20dog">hunting dog</a> or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil covered her head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a>.

Artemis was sometimes represented in Classical art with the crown of the <a href="crescent">crescent</a> <a href="moon">moon</a>, such as also found on <a href="Luna%20%28goddess%29">Luna</a> and others.

On June 7, 2007, a Roman era bronze sculpture of "<a href="Artemis%20and%20the%20Stag">Artemis and the Stag</a>" was sold at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> auction house in New York state by the <a href="Albright-Knox%20Art%20Gallery">Albright-Knox Art Gallery</a> for $25.5 million.


According to the <a href="Homeric%20Hymn">Homeric Hymn</a> to Artemis, she had golden bow and arrows, as her epithet was Khryselakatos ("of the Golden Shaft") and Iokheira ("showered by arrows"). The arrows of Artemis could also bring sudden death and disease to girls and women. Artemis got her bow and arrow for the first time from The Kyklopes, as the one she asked from her father. The bow of Artemis also became the witness of Callisto's oath of her virginity. In later cult, the bow became the symbol of waxing moon.
Artemis' chariot was made of gold and was pulled by four golden horned deer (Elaphoi Khrysokeroi). The bridles of her chariot were also made of gold.

Although quite seldom, Artemis is sometimes portrayed with a hunting spear. Her cult in Aetolia, the Artemis Aetolian, showed her with a hunting spear. The description about Artemis' spear can be found in Ovid's Metamorphosis, while Artemis with a fishing spear connected with her cult as a patron goddess of fishing.

As a goddess of maiden dances and songs, Artemis is often portrayed with a lyre.

Deer were the only animals held sacred to Artemis herself. On seeing a deer larger than a bull with horns shining, she fell in love with these creatures and held them sacred. Deer were also the first animals she captured. She caught five golden horned deer called Elaphoi Khrysokeroi and harnessed them to her chariot. The <a href="Labours%20of%20Hercules">third labour of Heracles</a>, commanded by <a href="Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a>, consisted of catching the <a href="Cerynitian%20Hind">Cerynitian Hind</a> alive. Heracles begged Artemis for forgiveness and promised to return it alive. Artemis forgave him but targeted Eurystheus for her wrath.
Artemis got her hunting dogs from <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a> in the forest of Arcadia. Pan gave Artemis two black-and-white dogs, three reddish ones, and one spotted one – these dogs were able to hunt even lions. Pan also gave Artemis seven bitches of the finest Arcadian race. However, Artemis only ever brought seven dogs hunting with her at any one time.
The sacrifice of a bear for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced to the people of Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to understand how to end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').
The boar is one of the favorite animals of the hunters, and also hard to tame. In honor of Artemis' skill, they sacrificed it to her. Oineus and Adonis were both killed by Artemis' boar.
Artemis felt pity for the Meleagrids as they mourned for their lost brother, Meleagor, so she transformed them into Guinea Fowl to be her favorite animals.
Hawks were the favored birds of many of the gods, Artemis included.

<a href="Arecaceae">Palm</a> and <a href="Cypress">Cypress</a> were issued to be her birthplace. Other plants sacred to Artemis are <a href="Amaranth">Amaranth</a> and <a href="Asphodelus">Asphodel</a>.

At Ephesus in <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>, Turkey, her temple became one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the World</a>. It was probably the best known center of her worship except for Delos. There the Lady whom the Ionians associated with Artemis through "<a href="interpretatio%20graeca">interpretatio graeca</a>" was worshipped primarily as a <a href="mother%20goddess">mother goddess</a>, akin to the Phrygian goddess <a href="Cybele">Cybele</a>, in an ancient sanctuary where her <a href="cult%20image">cult image</a> depicted the "Lady of Ephesus" adorned with multiple rounded breast-like protuberances on her chest. They have been variously interpreted as multiple <a href="accessory%20breast">accessory breast</a>s, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes. Excavation at the site of the "Artemision" in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped <a href="amber">amber</a> beads that had adorned the ancient wooden cult image or "<a href="xoanon">xoanon</a>". In <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"” Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location. The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.

<a href="105%20Artemis">105 Artemis</a>, the <a href="Artemis%20%28crater%29">Artemis (crater)</a>, the <a href="Artemis%20Chasma">Artemis Chasma</a> and the <a href="Artemis%20Corona">Artemis Corona</a> have all been named after the goddess.

Artemis is the acronym for "Architectures de bolometres pour des Telescopes a grand champ de vue dans le domaine sub-Millimetrique au Sol", a large <a href="bolometer">bolometer</a> camera in the <a href="Submillimetre%20astronomy">submillimeter</a> range that was installed in 2010 at the <a href="Atacama%20Pathfinder%20Experiment">Atacama Pathfinder Experiment</a> (APEX), located in the <a href="Atacama%20desert">Atacama Desert</a> in northern Chile.

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> genus "<a href="Artemia">Artemia</a>", which entirely comprises the family Artemiidae, derives from Artemis. "Artemia" are aquatic crustaceans known as brine shrimp, the best known species of which, "<a href="Artemia%20salina">Artemia salina</a>", or <a href="Sea%20Monkeys">Sea Monkeys</a>, was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758. "Artemia" live in salt lakes, and although they are almost never found in an open sea, they do appear along the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean coast</a> near <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, where the <a href="Temple%20of%20Artemis">Temple of Artemis</a> once stood.

Arbeit macht frei

"" () is a German phrase meaning "work sets you free". The slogan is known for appearing on the entrance of <a href="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a> and other <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>.

The expression comes from the title of a novel by German <a href="Philology">philologist</a> <a href="Lorenz%20Diefenbach">Lorenz Diefenbach</a>, "Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach" (1873), in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour. The phrase was also used in French (""le travail rend libre!"") by <a href="Auguste%20Forel">Auguste Forel</a>, a Swiss entomologist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his ""Fourmis de la Suisse"" ["Ants of Switzerland"] (1920). In 1922, the Deutsche Schulverein of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist "protective" organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase "Arbeit macht frei".

The slogan ""Arbeit macht frei"" was placed at the entrances to a number of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s. The slogan's use in this instance was ordered by <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> General <a href="Theodor%20Eicke">Theodor Eicke</a>, inspector of concentration camps and second commandant of <a href="Dachau%20Concentration%20Camp">Dachau Concentration Camp</a>.

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz I</a> where, according to <a href="BBC">BBC</a> historian <a href="Laurence%20Rees">Laurence Rees</a> in his "Auschwitz: a New History", the sign was erected by order of commandant <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a>. This particular sign was made by prisoner-labourers including <a href="Jan%20Liwacz">Jan Liwacz</a>. The sign features an upside-down 'B', which has been interpreted as an act of defiance by the prisoners who made it.

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a "wild camp" in the city of <a href="Oranienburg%20concentration%20camp">Oranienburg</a>, which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as <a href="Sachsenhausen%20%28detention%20camp%29">Sachsenhausen</a>). It can also be seen at the <a href="Dachau%20concentration%20camp">Dachau concentration camp</a>, <a href="Gross-Rosen%20concentration%20camp">Gross-Rosen concentration camp</a>, and the <a href="Concentration%20camp%20Theresienstadt">Theresienstadt</a> Ghetto-Camp, as well as at <a href="Fort%20Breendonk">Fort Breendonk</a> in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over entrance gates to Auschwitz III / Buna/Monowitz. The slogan appeared at the <a href="Flossenb%C3%BCrg%20concentration%20camp">Flossenbürg</a> camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists. <a href="Primo%20Levi">Primo Levi</a> describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) in <a href="Monowitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz III/Buna Monowitz</a>.

At <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald</a>, ""<a href="Jedem%20das%20Seine">Jedem das Seine</a>"" (literally, "to each his own", but idiomatically "everyone gets what he deserves") was used.

In 1938 the <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n political <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> writer <a href="Jura%20Soyfer">Jura Soyfer</a> and the <a href="composer">composer</a> <a href="Herbert%20Zipper">Herbert Zipper</a>, while prisoners at <a href="Dachau%20Concentration%20Camp">Dachau Concentration Camp</a>, wrote the "<a href="Dachaulied">Dachaulied</a>" (The Dachau Song). They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily <a href="forced%20labour">forced labour</a>, and considered the motto ""Arbeit macht frei"" over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a "lesson" taught by Dachau. (The first verse is translated in the article on <a href="Jura%20Soyfer">Jura Soyfer</a>.)

In "The Kingdom of Auschwitz", <a href="Otto%20Friedrich">Otto Friedrich</a> wrote about <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a>, regarding his decision to display the motto so prominently at the Auschwitz entrance:
Considering the role played by the Auschwitz prisons during the Holocaust as well as the individual prisoner's knowledge that once they entered the camp freedom was not likely to be obtained by any means other than death, the cruel comedy of the slogan becomes strikingly clear. The psychological impact it brought on those who passed through the gates of each of the camps - where it was seen - was incredibly powerful.

Signs displaying the slogan at the interpretive centers which now occupy the former Nazi concentration camps have repeatedly been targeted by thieves. Motivation for the thefts was originally thought to be for financial gain, however when the individuals responsible for the theft were identified it was revealed that in at least one instance the thieves themselves were affiliated with the <a href="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazi</a> movement.
The sign over Auschwitz was stolen in December 2009 and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish neo-Nazi former leader, and two Poles were jailed as a result. The original sign is now in storage at the <a href="Auschwitz-Birkenau%20State%20Museum">Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum</a> and a replica was put over the gate in its place.

On 2 November 2014, the sign over the Dachau gate was stolen. It was found on 28 November 2016 under a tarpaulin at a parking lot in <a href="Ytre%20Arna">Ytre Arna</a>, a settlement north of <a href="Bergen">Bergen, Norway</a>'s second-largest city.

Axayacatl

Axayacatl (; , ; , ; meaning "face of water"; c. 1449-1481) was the sixth "<a href="tlatoani">tlatoani</a>" of the "<a href="altepetl">altepetl</a>" of <a href="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a> and ruler of the <a href="Aztec%20Triple%20Alliance">Aztec Triple Alliance</a>.

Axayacatl was a son of the princess <a href="Atotoztli%20II">Atotoztli II</a> and her cousin, prince <a href="Tezozomoc%20%28son%20of%20Itzcoatl%29">Tezozomoc</a>. He was a grandson of the Emperors <a href="Moctezuma%20I">Moctezuma I</a> and <a href="Itzcoatl">Itzcoatl</a>. He was a descendant of the king <a href="Cuauhtototzin">Cuauhtototzin</a>.

He was a successor of Moctezuma and his brothers were Emperors <a href="Tizoc">Tizoc</a> and <a href="Ahuitzotl">Ahuitzotl</a> and his sister was the Queen <a href="Chalchiuhnenetzin">Chalchiuhnenetzin</a>. He was an uncle of the Emperor <a href="Cuauht%C3%A9moc">Cuauhtémoc</a> and father of Emperors <a href="Moctezuma%20II">Moctezuma II</a> and <a href="Cuitl%C3%A1huac">Cuitláhuac</a>.

During his youth, his military prowess gained him the favor influential figures such as <a href="Nezahualcoyotl%20%28tlatoani%29">Nezahualcoyotl</a> and <a href="Tlacaelel%20I">Tlacaelel I</a>, and thus, upon the death of <a href="Moctezuma%20I">Moctezuma I</a> in 1469, he was chosen to ascend to the throne, much to the displeasure of his two older brothers, <a href="Tizoc">Tizoc</a> and <a href="Ahuitzotl">Ahuitzotl</a>.

It is also important that the <a href="Aztec%20calendar%20stone">Great Sun Stone</a>, also known as the Aztec Calendar, was carved under his leadership. In the year 1475 there was a major earthquake that destroyed many homes in Temochtitlán.

Using as a pretext the insulting behavior of a few Tlatelolcan citizens, Axayacatl invaded his neighbor, killed its ruler, <a href="Moquihuix">Moquihuix</a>, and replaced him with a military governor. The Tlatelolcans lost any voice they had in forming Aztec policy.

Axayacatl largely dedicated his twelve-year reign to consolidating his militaristic repute: he led successful <a href="Aztec%20warfare">campaigns</a> against the neighboring "altepetl" of <a href="Tlatelolco%20%28altepetl%29">Tlatelolco</a> in 1473 and the <a href="Matlatzinca%20people">Matlatzinca</a> of the <a href="Toluca%20Valley">Toluca Valley</a> in 1474, but was finally defeated by the <a href="Pur%C3%A9pecha%20people">Tarascan</a>s of <a href="Michoac%C3%A1n">Michoacán</a> in 1476. Despite some subsequent minor triumphs, Axayacatl's defeat at the hands of the Tarascans irreversibly marred his image, as it constituted the only major defeat suffered by the Aztecs up to that moment. In spite of his young age, he fell gravely ill in 1480, passing away a mere year later, in 1481, whereupon he was succeeded by his brother Tizoc.

Ahuitzotl

Ahuitzotl (, ) was the eighth <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> ruler, the "<a href="Hueyi%20Tlatoani">Hueyi Tlatoani</a>" of the city of <a href="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a>, son of princess <a href="Atotoztli%20II">Atotoztli II</a>. He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor. He took power as <a href="tlatoani">tlatoani</a> in the year <a href="Aztec%20calendar">7 Rabbit</a> (1486), after the death of his predecessor and brother, <a href="Tizoc">Tizoc</a>.

His sons were kings <a href="Chimalpilli%20II">Chimalpilli II</a> and <a href="Cuauht%C3%A9moc">Cuauhtémoc</a> and he also had one daughter.

Perhaps the greatest known military leader of <a href="Pre-Columbian">Pre-Columbian</a> <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a <a href="Huastec%20civilization">Huastec</a> rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance. He conquered the <a href="Mixtec">Mixtec</a>, <a href="Zapotec%20civilization">Zapotec</a>, and other peoples from <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20of%20Mexico">Pacific Coast of Mexico</a> down to the western part of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Tenochtitlan">Templo Mayor</a> in the year <a href="Aztec%20calendar">8 Reed</a> (1487).

He presided over the introduction of the <a href="great-tailed%20grackle">great-tailed grackle</a> into the Valley of Mexico, the earliest documented case of human-mediated bird introduction in the Western Hemisphere.

Ahuizotl died in the year <a href="Aztec%20calendar">10 Rabbit</a> (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, <a href="Moctezuma%20II">Moctezuma II</a>.

Ahuizotl took his name from the <a href="Ahuizotl%20%28creature%29">animal ahuizotl</a>, which the Aztecs considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

On 3 August 2007, Mexican archaeologists announced discovery of what is believed to be the <a href="tomb">tomb</a> of Ahuizotl beneath a sculpture of <a href="Tlaltecuhtli">Tlaltecuhtli</a> near the <a href="Plaza%20de%20la%20Constituci%C3%B3n">Zócalo in Mexico City</a>.

<doc id="2909" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2909" title="Albinism">
Albinism

Albinism in humans is a <a href="congenital%20disorder">congenital disorder</a> characterized by the complete or partial absence of <a href="Biological%20pigment">pigment</a> in the skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as <a href="photophobia">photophobia</a>, <a href="nystagmus">nystagmus</a>, and <a href="amblyopia">amblyopia</a>. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as <a href="Ch%C3%A9diak%E2%80%93Higashi%20syndrome">Chédiak–Higashi syndrome</a>, albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.
Albinism results from inheritance of <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">recessive gene</a> <a href="allele">allele</a>s and is known to affect all <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, including <a href="human">human</a>s. It is due to absence or defect of <a href="tyrosinase">tyrosinase</a>, a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of <a href="melanin">melanin</a>. It is the opposite of <a href="melanism">melanism</a>. Unlike humans, other animals have multiple <a href="Biological%20pigments">pigments</a> and for these, <a href="Albinism%20in%20biology">albinism</a> is considered to be a hereditary condition characterised by the absence of melanin in particular, in the eyes, skin, hair, scales, feathers or cuticle. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an albino an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as <a href="Leucism">leucistic</a> or albinoid. The term is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "albus", "white".

In humans, there are two principal types of albinism: <a href="Oculocutaneous%20albinism">oculocutaneous</a>, affecting the eyes, skin and hair, and <a href="Ocular%20albinism">ocular</a> affecting the eyes only.

There are different types of oculocutaneous albinism depending on which gene has undergone mutation. With some there is no pigment at all. The other end of the spectrum of albinism is "a form of albinism called rufous oculocutaneous albinism, which usually affects dark-skinned people."

According to the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Albinism%20and%20Hypopigmentation">National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation</a>, "With ocular albinism, the color of the iris of the eye may vary from blue to green or even brown, and sometimes darkens with age. However, when an eye doctor examines the eye by shining a light from the side of the eye, the light shines back through the iris since very little pigment is present.".

Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> <a href="radiation">radiation</a>, their skin can <a href="sunburn">burn</a> more easily from overexposure.

The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. In photographs, those with albinism are more likely to demonstrate "red eye," due to the red of <a href="retina">retina</a> being visible through the iris. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, both related and unrelated to <a href="photosensitivity">photosensitivity</a>.

Those afflicted with albinism are generally as healthy as the rest of the population (but see related disorders below), with growth and development occurring as normal, and albinism by itself does not cause mortality, although the lack of pigment blocking <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> <a href="radiation">radiation</a> increases the risk of melanomas (skin cancers) and other problems.

Development of the optical system is highly dependent on the presence of melanin. For this reason, the reduction or absence of this pigment in people with albinism may lead to:

Eye conditions common in albinism include:

The improper development of the <a href="retinal%20pigment%20epithelium">retinal pigment epithelium</a> (RPE), which in normal eyes absorbs most of the reflected sunlight, further increases glare due to light scattering within the eye. The resulting sensitivity (photophobia) generally leads to discomfort in bright light, but this can be reduced by the use of sunglasses or brimmed hats.

<a href="Oculocutaneous%20albinism">Oculocutaneous albinism</a> is generally the result of the <a href="biological%20inheritance">biological inheritance</a> of <a href="dominance%20relationship">genetically recessive</a> <a href="allele">allele</a>s (<a href="gene">gene</a>s) passed from both parents of an individual for example <a href="OCA1">OCA1</a> and <a href="OCA2">OCA2</a>. A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis, resulting in a third oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) genotype, ″OCA3″. Some rare forms are inherited from only one parent. There are other <a href="genetic%20mutation">genetic mutation</a>s which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to changes in melanin production in the body. Some of these are associated with increased risk of skin cancer (<a href="List%20of%20cutaneous%20conditions%20associated%20with%20increased%20risk%20of%20nonmelanoma%20skin%20cancer">see list of such genetic variations</a>).

The chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms (including humans) can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both sexes. An exception to this is <a href="ocular%20albinism">ocular albinism</a>, which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, ocular albinism occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y chromosome, unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X chromosomes.

There are two different forms of albinism: a partial lack of the melanin is known as hypomelanism, or hypomelanosis, and the total absence of melanin is known as <a href="amelanism">amelanism</a> or amelanosis.

The enzyme defect responsible for OCA1-type albinism is tyrosine 3-monooxygenase (tyrosinase), which synthesizes melanin from the amino acid <a href="tyrosine">tyrosine</a>.

It is suggested that the early <a href="hominin">hominin</a> evolved in East Africa around 3 million years ago. The dramatic <a href="phenotype">phenotypic</a> change from <a href="primate">primate</a> to early hominin is hypothesized to have involved the extreme loss of body hair – except for areas most exposed to UV radiation, such as the head – to allow for more efficient <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> in the early hunter-gatherers. The skin that would have been exposed upon general body hair loss in these early hominins would have most likely been non-pigmented, reflecting the pale skin underlying the hair of our chimpanzee relatives. A positive advantage would have been conferred to early hominids inhabiting the African continent that were capable of producing darker skin – those who first expressed the <a href="eumelanin">eumelanin</a>-producing <a href="MC1R">MC1R</a> <a href="allele">allele</a> – which protected them from harmful epithelium-damaging ultraviolet rays. Over time, the advantage conferred to those with darker skin may have led to the prevalence of darker skin on the continent. The positive advantage, however, would have had to be strong enough so as to produce a significantly higher reproductive fitness in those who produced more melanin. The cause of a selective pressure strong enough to cause this shift is an area of much debate. Some hypotheses include the existence of significantly lower reproductive fitness in people with less melanin due to lethal skin cancer, lethal kidney disease due to excess <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> formation in the skin of people with less melanin, or simply natural selection due to mate preference and sexual selection.

When comparing the prevalence of albinism in Africa to its prevalence in other parts of the world, such as Europe and the United States, the potential evolutionary effects of skin cancer as a selective force due to its effect on these populations may not be insignificant. The prevalence of albinism in some <a href="ethnic%20groups%20in%20Africa">ethnic groups</a> in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> is around 1 in 5,000, while in Europe and the US it is 1 in 20,000. It would follow, then, that there would be stronger selective forces acting on albino populations in Africa than on albino populations in Europe and the US. Rates as high as 1 in 1,000 have been reported for some populations in Zimbabwe and other parts of <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>. In two separate studies in Nigeria, people with albinism were found to be of reproductively significant age more often than not. One study found that 89% of people diagnosed with albinism are between 0 and 30 years of age, while the other found that 77% of albinos were under the age of 20.

<a href="Genetic%20testing">Genetic testing</a> can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits except in the cases of non-OCA disorders that cause albinism "along with" other medical problems which may be treatable. There is no 'cure' for Albinism. The "symptoms" of albinism can be assisted by various methods.

Since there is no cure for albinism, it is managed through lifestyle adjustments. People with albinism need to take care not to sunburn and should have regular healthy skin checks by a dermatologist.

For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery is possible on the extra-ocular muscles to decrease <a href="strabismus">strabismus</a>. <a href="Nystagmus">Nystagmus</a>-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the "shaking" of the eyes back and forth. The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.

<a href="Glasses">Glasses</a>, low vision aids, <a href="large-print">large-print</a> materials, and bright angled reading lights can help individuals with albinism. Some people with albinism do well using <a href="bifocals">bifocals</a> (with a strong reading lens), prescription reading glasses, hand-held devices such as <a href="Magnifying%20glass">magnifiers</a> or <a href="monocular">monocular</a>s or wearable devices like <a href="eSight">eSight</a>
and <a href="Brainport">Brainport</a>.

Albinism is often associated with the absence of an iris in the eye. <a href="Contact%20lens">Contact lens</a>es may be colored to block light transmission through the aniridic eye. Some use <a href="bioptics%20%28device%29">bioptics</a>, glasses which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some US states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving motor vehicles. (See also <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Albinism%20and%20Hypopigmentation">NOAH</a> bulletin "Low Vision Aids".)

To support those with albinism, and their families, the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Albinism%20and%20Hypopigmentation">National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation</a> was set up to provide a network of resources and information.

Albinism affects people of all ethnic backgrounds; its frequency worldwide is estimated to be approximately one in 17,000. Prevalence of the different forms of albinism varies considerably by population, and is highest overall in people of <a href="sub-Saharan">sub-Saharan</a> African descent.

Certain ethnic groups and populations in isolated areas exhibit heightened susceptibility to albinism, presumably due to genetic factors. These include notably the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> <a href="Kuna%20%28people%29">Kuna</a>, <a href="Zuni%20people">Zuni</a> and <a href="Hopi">Hopi</a> nations (respectively of <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>); <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, in which one particular form of albinism is unusually common; and <a href="Ukerewe%20Island">Ukerewe Island</a>, the population of which shows a very high incidence of albinism.

In physical terms, humans with albinism commonly have visual problems and need sun protection. 

Humans with albinism often face social and cultural challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. It is especially socially stigmatised in many African societies. A study conducted in Nigeria on albino children stated that "they experienced alienation, avoided social interactions and were less emotionally stable. Furthermore, affected individuals were less likely to complete schooling, find employment, and find partners". Many cultures around the world have developed beliefs regarding people with albinism.

In African countries such as <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> and <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, there has been an unprecedented rise in <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>-related killings of people with albinism in recent years, because their body parts are used in potions sold by <a href="witchdoctor">witchdoctor</a>s. Numerous authenticated incidents have occurred in Africa during the 21st century. For example, in Tanzania, in September 2009, three men were convicted of killing a 14-year-old albino boy and severing his legs in order to sell them for witchcraft purposes. Again in Tanzania and Burundi in 2010, the murder and dismemberment of a kidnapped albino child was reported from the courts, as part of a continuing problem. <a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a> estimates that in Tanzania a complete set of albino body parts is worth $75,000.

Another harmful and false belief is that sex with an albinistic woman will cure a man of <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. This has led, for example in <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>, to rapes (and subsequent HIV infection).

Famous people with albinism include historical figures such as <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a> don <a href="William%20Archibald%20Spooner">William Archibald Spooner</a>; actor-comedian <a href="Victor%20Varnado">Victor Varnado</a>; musicians such as <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Winter">Edgar Winter</a>, <a href="Salif%20Keita">Salif Keita</a>, <a href="Yellowman">Winston "Yellowman" Foster</a>, <a href="Brother%20Ali">Brother Ali</a>, <a href="Sivuca">Sivuca</a>, <a href="Piano%20Red">Willie "Piano Red" Perryman</a>; and fashion models <a href="Connie%20Chiu">Connie Chiu</a> and <a href="Shaun%20Ross%20%28model%29">Shaun Ross</a>. <a href="Emperor%20Seinei">Emperor Seinei</a> of Japan is thought to have been an albino because he was said to have been born with white hair.

International Albinism Awareness Day was established after a motion was accepted on 18 December 2014 by the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a>, proclaiming that as of 2015, 13 June would be known as International Albinism Awareness Day. This was followed by a mandate created by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Human%20Rights%20Council">United Nations Human Rights Council</a> that appointed Ms. Ikponwosa Ero, who is from Nigeria, as the very first Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism.

Albinism and other types of pigment mutations occur in both animals and plants.

Amr Diab

Amr Abd El-Basset Abd El-Azeez Diab (born October 11, 1961) is an <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian pop singer-songwriter. He was born in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, Egypt.
According to a research by Michael Frishkopf, he has created his style termed as "Mediterranean Music", a blend of Western and Egyptian rhythms. By 1992, he became the first Arab artist to start making high-tech music videos.
Amr Diab was born on 11 October 1961 in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, Egypt into an artistic family. His father, Abdul Basset Diab, worked for the Suez Canal Corporation and was the chairman of Marine Construction & Shipbuilding in suez Canal. Diab's father played a huge role in igniting the early sparks of musical inspiration towards Diab's early stages in his professional music career. Diab, at the age of six, had his first shot at fame when he sang the <a href="Egypt">Egyptian National Anthem</a> "<a href="Bilady%2C%20Bilady%2C%20Bilady">Bilady, Bilady, Bilady</a>" at the annual 23 July Festival in Port Said. As a result, he was rewarded with a guitar from the governor of Port Said, and began to become recognised nationally. Diab graduated with a bachelor's degree in Arabic Music from the Cairo Academy of Arts in 1986.

Diab released his first album entitled "Ya Tareeq" in 1983. Diab's second album, "Ghanny Men Albak" (1985), was the first of a series of records he released with Delta Sound, including "Hala Hala" (1986), "Khalseen" (1987), "Mayyal" (1988), "Shawa'na" (1989), "Matkhafesh" (1990), "Habibi" (1991), "Ayyamna" (1992), "Ya Omrena" (1993), "Weylomony" (1994), and Rag'een (1995). In 1996 Diab released his first album with <a href="Alam%20El%20Phan">Alam El Phan</a> entitled "<a href="Nour%20El%20Ain">Nour El Ain</a>", which proved an international success and gained Diab recognition beyond the Arabic speaking world. Diab recorded four more albums on the Alam El Phan label including Amarain (1999) on which he collaborated with <a href="Khaled%20%28musician%29">Khaled</a> (on the song "Alby") and with <a href="Angela%20Dimitriou">Angela Dimitriou</a> (on the song "Bahebak Aktar").

In the summer of 2004 Diab, having left <a href="Alam%20El%20Phan">Alam El Phan</a>, released his first album with <a href="Rotana%20Records">Rotana Records</a>, "<a href="Leily%20Nahary">Leily Nehary</a>," which he followed up with the hugely successful "<a href="Kammel%20Kalamak">Kammel Kalamak</a>" (2005), and "<a href="El%20Lilady">El Lilady</a>" (2007). September 2011 saw the release of his album "Banadeek Taala", produced by Rotana. In February 2011, Amr Diab released his hit single "Masr Allet" (Egypt spoke). In 2012, Diab hosted the first <a href="Google%20Hangouts">Google Hangout</a> in the Middle East during his performance in Dubai. In October 2014, Amr Diab released his album "Shoft El Ayam" which topped his last album "El Leila" and again became the best selling album in Egypt in iTunes and Rotana. In July 2015, Amr Diab released the music video from his song "Gamalo" from his album "Shoft El Ayam."in March 2016 he released his last and current album "Ahla w ahla" which was produced for the first time by "Nay Records", after leaving Rotana Music.His new album "Maadi el Nas" will be released in July 2017 with "Nay Records"

Diab is known as the father of Mediterranean Music. David Cooper and Kevin Dawe refer to his music as "the new breed of Mediterranean music". According to author Michael Frishkopf, Diab has produced a new concept of Mediterranean music, especially with his international hit, "Nour El Ain".

He has been awarded the <a href="World%20Music%20Awards">World Music Award</a> for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist four times: 1996 for album "<a href="Nour%20El%20Ain">Nour El Ain</a>", 2001 for album "Akter Wahed", 2007 for album "El Lillady" and 2013 for "El Leila" album. He has also won (Best Egyptian Artist, Best Male Arab Artist and World's Best Arab Male Artist Voted Online) at the World Music Awards 2014. Amr Diab is the only Middle Eastern artist to have received 7 World Music Awards.

He also won The African Music Awards 2009 as Artist Of The Year, Song Of The Year, Video Of The Year And Best Male Act, and won The 2010 African Music Awards as best male act and best artist of North Africa. He is the only African artist to have received 6 African Music Awards in his career. Diab won Big Apple Music Awards 2009 as Lifetime Achievements Awards and Best Singer of The Year and also won The Global Icon Award, Most Popular Artist and Best Arabic Male Artist in 2014.

On September 28, 2016 Diab announced that he achieved a <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a> title for Most World Music Awards for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist 

"Tamally Ma'ak", meaning "Always with you", is written by Ahmed Ali Moussa and the music for the song was composed by Sherif Tag.[1] Original arrangement was by Tarek Madkour. The video was filmed in Czech Republic and the instrumentation prominently included the classic guitar.
"<a href="Wayah">Wayah</a>" (With [Her]) was released for sale on the internet on 27 June; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab's fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies.

On 18 October 2009 Amr Diab won four 2009 African Music Awards in the following categories: best artist, best album, best vocalist and best song for "Wayah"; Amr Diab had been nominated by the Big Apple Music Awards.

It is the newest album of Amr in 2016 after leaving Rotana

This album is produced by NAY company

The album consists of 12 songs.

Diab is one of the first singers to popularize music videos in the Arab world and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, "El Afareet", which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film "Ice Cream in Gleam" ("Ays Krim fi Glym"), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the <a href="UCLA%20School%20of%20Theater%2C%20Film%20and%20Television">UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television</a>. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program "Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films" at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the "Los Angeles Weekly" termed it "observant" and "a big leap". His third movie was released in 1993, and was named "Deahk We La'ab" ("Laughter and Fun"). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star <a href="Omar%20Sharif">Omar Sharif</a> ("<a href="Lawrence%20of%20Arabia%20%28film%29">Lawrence of Arabia</a>", "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28film%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>") and <a href="Yousra">Yousra</a>. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.

During the 2011 uprising, some protesters criticized Diab for staying silent, and for fleeing Egypt for London. A few days after former President <a href="Hosni%20Mubarak">Hosni Mubarak</a> stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, "Masr A'let" (Egypt Said), and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the <a href="2011%20Egyptian%20revolution">uprising</a>. He initiated a charity campaign "Masry Begad" ("Truly Egyptian"), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what the Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.

Amr Diab's songs have appeared in several films, including:

Belgian hip hop

Belgian hip hop music has a few <a href="rapper">rapper</a>s stemming from <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, like <a href="France">France</a>, controlled <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n countries like the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (formerly Zaire), <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, and <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a> until the early 1960s. Like in France, <a href="Immigration">immigrants</a> from these countries started to study and live in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>.

The Belgian <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> scene started in the late 1980s with a U.S.-based <a href="techno%20music">techno</a>/hip hop group called <a href="Technotronic">Technotronic</a>. In the group was an emcee named <a href="Ya%20Kid%20K">Ya Kid K</a> from the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> who later led the group into international fame with hits like "Pump up the Jam" and "Shake That Body". In 1990, she also joined the group Hi-Tek 3 who were heard on the "<a href="Teenage%20Mutant%20Ninja%20Turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>" movie <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a>. 

However, the first major pop rapper from Belgium was <a href="Benny%20B">Benny B</a>, who had a very mainstream and commercial sound. According to the European Music Office's report on "Music in Europe", this was the first of many pop acts that helped inspire a backlash and the creation of an underground hip hop scene.

Also in the late 1990s in the <a href="Wallonia">Walloon south</a> of the country, French speaking/rapping <a href="Starflam">Starflam</a> was the biggest name in hip hop. In the <a href="Flanders">Flemish</a> north Dutch speaking/rapping groups like <a href="%27t%20Hof%20van%20Commerce">'t Hof van Commerce</a>, Krapoel In Axe, St Andries MC's, and ABN were popular, rapping in their regional <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s.

Dutch hip hop

Dutch hip hop or Nederhop is <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a> created by musicians in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>.

Between 1980 and 1985 a few Dutch Hip Hop records had already been released, but in 1986 Dutch rap duo <a href="MC%20Miker%20G%20%26amp%3B%20DJ%20Sven">MC Miker G & DJ Sven</a> (Lucien Witteveen and Sven van Veen) had a major top 10 hit (often #1) across Europe with their "Holiday Rap", which sampled <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna's</a> "Holiday". That same year Dutch rapper <a href="Extince">Extince</a> released his first record: Rap Around The Clock. Another 1980s group was the <a href="Osdorp%20Posse">Osdorp Posse</a>, who first started to record tracks in Dutch. But there is disagreement about who started rapping in Dutch between Blonnie B, Alex and the CityCrew, Dynamic Rockers, Def Rhymes and Osdorp Posse.

Notable in the late 1980s were All Star Fresh of <a href="King%20Bee%20%28hip%20hop%20group%29">King Bee</a> topping charts with: "Back by Dope Demand" in early 1990 and Rudeboy of <a href="Urban%20Dance%20Squad">Urban Dance Squad</a> who, at the time, were arguably more widely known in New York City than the Netherlands. DJ and Producer All Star Fresh Started as a Pro in 1979. After winning the Dutch Mixing Championships (DMC) in 1988, he was invited for The World Mix Championships in the London Royal Hall and won third place in a fierce competition. He was invited by Dave Funkenklein to enter the lions hole in New York. He made history in the Big Apple of Hiphop by being the first non -American to fly into the finals of The World Supremacy Battle of DJs. He gained the highly respected second place of this prestigious DJ contest). The impression that he made that year, resulted in many invitations to perform with world known artists like Public Enemy, Stetsasonic, Ice T and Ultra Magnetic MCs.

All Star Fresh. As performer and producer he is very well known as KING BEE. With his second floor filler Back By Dope Demand he scored one of the biggest hiphop hits. In the Netherlands it resulted in a Top 3 position. Best Dance Product by The Edison Awards in the Netherlands. (The Edison Awards is an award by the Dutch Music Industry.) This also meant that with this title, he was the first black artist to win this award in the Netherlands. After that he appeared as supporting act for Madonnas show in the Netherlands. All Star Fresh kept entering the dance floors. The last titles mentioned were also worldwide hits, selling over 2.4 million copies. He didn't only work within projects like King Bee or Capella, but also was featuring famous production teams like Snap (I Got the Power). This teamwork resulted in the single Lets Get Busy (Clubland Quarts feat Snap King Bee). This record ended up No 01 in the Billboard Dance Charts (United States). Other productions were Deepzone "It's Gonna Be All right", a straight up club anthem even until today. Kellee- my love, Ty Holden- you're my Inspiration and His Royal Freshness- They don't understand are a couple of other productions in this line.

Urban Dance Squad was a Dutch rap rock band formed after what was originally intended as a one-time jam-session at a festival in Utrecht on 20 December 1986[1]. Band members were rapper Rudeboy Remmington (Patrick Tilon), guitarist Tres Manos (René van Barneveld), bassist Sil (Silvano Matadin), drummer Magic Stick (Michel Schoots) and DJ DNA (DoNotAsk) (Arjen de Vreede). The band's music is described as a blend of genres, including hard rock, funk, soul, hip hop, reggae, jazz and ska and is often compared to that of Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone. They are widely known for their hit single "Deeper Shade of Soul", which charted at number 21 in the United States on Billboard Hot 100. It is a well known fact that Rage Against the Machine was inspired by the Urban Dance Squad.

In 1992, Osdorp Posse released their debut album "Osdorp Stijl", which was the first-ever hip hop in Dutch language. They started out translating <a href="N.W.A">N.W.A</a> songs to <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, though later wrote their own rhymes in Dutch. Their beats, created by producer Seda on Amiga 500 with Protracker, have a familiar heavy sound and are similar to U.S. old-school hip hop. Frontman Def-P describes it as <a href="hardcore%20rap">hardcore rap</a>. In the 17 years of de Osdorp Posse's existence, the crew hasn't changed their style and are still making hardcore hip hop.

After the first Osdorp Posse demo cassette they toured around the Netherlands. In Deventer they found the first followers and the first Dutch language hip hop scene. The first hip hop groups after Osdorp Posse were Zuid-Oost Posse and Maasstraat Mannen. These groups did concerts all over the Netherlands. Maasstraat became famous as the first group combining reggae with Dutch lyrics, inspiring acts like Postmen, for example.

Another Dutch-language rapper is Extince, who in 1995 took Nederhop to a new commercial level. With two of his singles "Spraakwater" and "Kaal of Kammen" being major hits in the mid-1990s, Extince was the first Dutch rapper making the MegaCharts. Other notable acts include Ali B (who has been featured on other artists' tracks, most significantly with Marco Borsato on the song "Wat zou je doen?" for the charity <a href="War%20Child%20%28charity%29">War Child</a> who achieved solo success with "Leipe mocro flavour". Together with his cousin Yes-R he made an international remix of "<a href="Ghetto%20%28Akon%20song%29">Ghetto</a>" together with Akon.; the duo Lange Frans & Baas B with their patriotic but introspective "<a href="Het%20land%20van%20%28song%29">Het Land Van</a>"; and <a href="Yes-R">Yes-R</a>. Other notable groups are "Opgezwolle" (consisting of rapper Sticky Steez, rapper Phreaco Rico and DJ Delic) and Brainpower.

There were two styles dominating the Dutch hip hop landscape: <a href="Extince">Extince</a>, known for his easy flows, catchy songs and funky tunes, while hardcore performers like <a href="Westklan">Westklan</a> and <a href="Osdorp%20Posse">Osdorp Posse</a> found their own niche group of fans.

In the mid-1990s <a href="The%20Postmen">The Postmen</a> were topping the charts with their rap/<a href="reggae">reggae</a> mix.

In the early 2000s the MC fronted band <a href="Relax%20%28band%29">Relax</a> got much airplay, as did de Spookrijders.

A combination of these two styles gave birth to de Spookrijders, a three-man hip-hop group founded in 1996. With MCs Stefan and Clyde rapping about their personal lives and life in Amsterdam as a black man, de Spookrijders even gained respect from non-hip-hop musicians and fans. Most people admired the work of producer/DJ Cliff 'the Jazz' Nille after releasing Spookrijders debut album "De Echte Shit". In 1999 de Spookrijders hit the charts twice with the hits "Klokkenluiders" and "Ik ben de man." Both these songs appeared on the second album, "Klokkenluiders van Amsterdam". After some personal arguments among the three crewmembers, de Spookrijders split up in 2003, after releasing their and final third album "Hee... Spookies!!"

Def Rhymz, Spookrijders & Brainpower really helped develop the game. Def Rhymz & Brainpower dropped multiple hit records. With at least 8 Top 100 album/EP projects Brainpower is one of the most successful Dutch MC's ever and remains a prolific bilingual lyricist (in Dutch & in English) to this day.

<a href="Opgezwolle">Opgezwolle</a>, a group from <a href="Zwolle">Zwolle</a>'s latest album, "<a href="Eigen%20Wereld">Eigen Wereld</a>" (Own World) appeared in the 'Album Top 100' at number 4; the highest notation of a Dutch rap album ever. <a href="Opgezwolle">Opgezwolle</a> split up on 30 November 2007. Members Rico & Sticks formed a new group, <a href="Fakkelbrigade">Fakkelbrigade</a> with <a href="MC%20Typhoon">MC Typhoon</a>, <a href="Mick%202dope%20Murray">Mick 2dope Murray</a>, <a href="MC%20James">MC James</a> and beatmaker <a href="A.R.T.%20%28musician%29">ART</a>. In 2009, they released the album "<a href="Colucci%20Era">Colucci Era</a>".

In the mid-2000s <a href="Cilvaringz">Cilvaringz</a>, <a href="Ali%20B">Ali B</a> and <a href="Raymzter">Raymzter</a> have commercially been successful and <a href="Lange%20Frans%20%26amp%3B%20Baas%20B">Lange Frans & Baas B</a> have had multiple No. 1 hits. In 2005, <a href="De%20Jeugd%20van%20Tegenwoordig">De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig</a> ("Kids These Days") were successful with "<a href="Watskeburt">Watskeburt</a>?!" ("Wuzhappenin?!").

Rapper <a href="Jawat">Jawat</a> won the "<a href="Grote%20Prijs%20van%20Nederland">Grote Prijs van Nederland</a>" 2006.

Another Dutch hip-hop duo are <a href="Pete%20Philly%20and%20Perquisite">Pete Philly and Perquisite</a> who are already well known in the Netherlands, Germany, and even in Japan.

A famous Dutch rapper outside the Netherlands is Salah Edin. His album <a href="Nederlands%20Grootste%20Nachtmerrie">Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie</a> (Biggest Nightmare of the Netherlands) won Best Album Award in 2007 and was fully produced by Dr. Dre's right-hand man Focus. He also shot three of the most expensive music videos ever in the history of Dutch Hip Hop and through a management deal with <a href="Cilvaringz">Cilvaringz</a>, performed in 34 countries worldwide.

The year 2010 is considered an important year for Dutch hip-hop, with many albums and mixtapes released from the biggest Dutch rappers.

Also <a href="Mc%20Battles">Mc Battles</a> are having a large amount of popularity.

Nederhop is growing fast. So are the recently Nederhop blogs as Nederhopofficial.nl and Puna.nl.

The Dutch hip-hop scene also saw many conflicts between rappers, followed by diss tracks. The following were among the biggest Dutch feuds in hip-hop:

[Osdorp Posse] Vs [Extince], [Brain Power] Vs [Extince], <a href="T.H.C">T.H.C</a> . Vs <a href="Negativ">Negativ</a>, <a href="Kempi">Kempi</a> Vs <a href="Nino%20%28rapper%29">Nino</a>, <a href="Brainpower">Brainpower</a> Vs <a href="Extince">Extince</a>, Yukkie B Vs Negativ, T.H.C. Vs Lexxxus, Baas B Vs Kimo, Kempi Vs Mini, Kempi Vs Bloedserieus, Heist Rockah Vs Negativ, and Regga Vs Lexxxus.

The feud between T.H.C. and Lexxxus resulted in a fistfight on a hip-hop event, when T.H.C. frontman rocks got into an argument with Lexxxus and then started the fistfight. Also many Dutch rappers got shot/stabbed, wounding or killing them. Bloedserieus rapper Sane got in a fight over drugs and was fatally stabbed at Eindhoven Central Station. Kane (another rapper of Bloedserieus and the twinbrother of Sane) made a song about this called "Jonko voor Sane" (Joint for Sane). Amsterdam rappers Lexxxus, Flex of T.H.C. and Mr. Probz got shot.

Dutch gangsta hip hop is currently a large scene together with underground hip-hop. Among the most notable groups are <a href="Tuindorp%20Hustler%20Click">THC</a>, <a href="Heinek%27n">Heinek'n</a>, <a href="Keizer%20%28rapper%29">Keizer</a>, <a href="Kempi">Kempi</a>, Steen, Hef, Crooks, <a href="Adonis%20%28rapper%29">Adonis</a> and <a href="Negativ">Negativ</a>. The rhythms are influenced by the American rap scene, and the <a href="lyrics">lyrics</a> are often about crime, <a href="drugs">drugs</a>, money, women and other criminal things.
Often coming from Dutch <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s, lyrics often include themes occurring in these areas.
Dutch gangsta hip hop mostly comes from <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="Den%20Haag">Den Haag</a>, <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> and <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>.

The commercial success of Dutch hip hop is largely made by <a href="Brainpower">Brainpower</a>, <a href="Yes-R">Yes-R</a>, <a href="Ali%20B">Ali B</a>, <a href="Lange%20Frans%20%26amp%3B%20Baas%20B">Lange Frans & Baas B</a> and <a href="Extince">Extince</a>. For a large part of the Dutch hip hop community Yes-R, Ali B and Lange Frans & Baas B are sometimes considered fake because they do a lot of work for children TV stations. <a href="Brainpower">Brainpower</a> and <a href="Extince">Extince</a> however both enjoy a great respect for bringing up hip hop in their native <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>. Other commercial rappers are <a href="De%20Jeugd%20van%20Tegenwoordig">De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig</a>, and one of the more popular artists in the Netherlands, Partysquad or The Partysquad. They are a 2-man group, having had success with hits such as "Stuk" (Broken), and "Dat is Die Shit" (That's the shit), with other popular songs in the background such as "Non Stop" ft. <a href="Brainpower">Brainpower</a>, "We Gaan Los" (we're going crazy {because of highness or drunkenness}) with Kempi, and "Wat Wil Je Doen" (What do you want to do?).

The Dutch <a href="Old%20school%20hip%20hop">oldskool</a> exists out of three primary artists, <a href="LTH%20%28musician%29">LTH</a>, <a href="Osdorp%20Posse">Osdorp Posse</a>, <a href="Extince">Extince</a>, <a href="Sugacane">Sugacane</a> and <a href="Duvelduvel">Duvelduvel</a>. <a href="Osdorp%20Posse">Osdorp Posse</a> make to what they themselves call hardcore rap and use beats that have much in common with <a href="N.W.A">N.W.A</a>. Their lyrics are about racism, prostitution (not always negatively), police and other social subjects. Extince uses very different, more funky kind of beats than Osdorp Posse and uses a completely different rapstyle. Duvelduvel is known as a conceptual hip hop group.

The Dutch hip hop scene is roughly divided by the Netherlands' larger cities.

Anaïs Nin

Anaïs Nin (; born Angela Anaïs Juana Antolina Rosa Edelmira Nin y Culmell; February 21, 1903 – January 14, 1977) was an essayist and memoirist born to Cuban parents in France, where she was also raised. She spent some time in Spain and Cuba, but lived most of her life in the United States, where she became an established author. She wrote <a href="diary">journal</a>s (which span more than 60 years, beginning when she was 11 years old and ending shortly before her death), novels, critical studies, <a href="essay">essay</a>s, <a href="short%20story">short stories</a>, and <a href="erotic%20literature">erotica</a>. A great deal of her work, including "<a href="Delta%20of%20Venus">Delta of Venus</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Birds">Little Birds</a>", was published posthumously.

Anaïs Nin was born in <a href="Neuilly-sur-Seine">Neuilly</a>, France, to artistic parents. Her father, <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Nin">Joaquín Nin</a>, was a Cuban pianist and composer of <a href="Catalans">Catalan</a> Spanish descent when he met her mother, Rosa Culmell, a classically trained Cuban singer of French and Danish descent. Her father's grandfather had fled France during the <a href="French%20Revolution">Revolution</a>, going first to <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>, then <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, and finally to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> where he helped build that country's first railway.

Nin was raised a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> but left the Catholic Church at the age of 16. She spent her childhood and early life in Europe. Her parents separated when she was two; her mother then moved Anaïs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Nin-Culmell">Joaquín Nin-Culmell</a>, to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, and then to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. According to her diaries, "Volume One, 1931–1934", Nin abandoned formal schooling at sixteen and later began working as an artist's model. After being in America for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak Spanish, but retained her French and became fluent in English.

On March 3, 1923, in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, Nin married her first husband, <a href="Hugh%20Parker%20Guiler">Hugh Parker Guiler</a> (1898–1985), a banker and artist, later known as "Ian Hugo" when he became a maker of <a href="experimental%20film">experimental film</a>s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to Paris the following year, where Guiler pursued his <a href="banking">banking</a> career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s with <a href="Francisco%20Miralles%20Arnau">Francisco Miralles Arnau</a>. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> called "", which she wrote in sixteen days.

She was transformed by <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, first with <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Allendy">René Allendy</a> in 1932 and then with <a href="Otto%20Rank">Otto Rank</a>. Both men eventually became her lovers, as she recounts in her "Journal". On her second visit to Rank, Nin reflects on her desire to be "re-born" as a woman and artist. Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say. "As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless".

In the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the approaching <a href="Second%20World%20War">war</a>, Nin left Paris and returned to New York City with her husband. (Guiler was, according to his own wishes, all but edited out of the diaries published during Nin's lifetime; his role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge.) During the war, Nin sent her books to Frances Steloff of the <a href="Gotham%20Book%20Mart">Gotham pageRank.Book Mart</a> in New York for safekeeping.

In New York, Anaïs rejoined Otto Rank, who had previously moved there, and moved into his apartment. She actually began to act as a psychoanalyst herself, seeing patients in the room next to Rank's, and having sex with her patients on the psychoanalytic couch.

According to her diaries, "Vol.1, 1931–1934", Nin shared a <a href="bohemian%20style">bohemian</a> lifestyle with <a href="Henry%20Miller">Henry Miller</a> during her time in Paris. Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1–2) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.

In 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor <a href="Rupert%20Pole">Rupert Pole</a> in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party. The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior. On March 17, 1955, while still married to Guiler, she married Pole at <a href="Quartzsite%2C%20Arizona">Quartzsite, Arizona</a>, returning with him to live in California. Guiler remained in New York City and was unaware of Nin's second marriage until after her death in 1977, though biographer <a href="Deirdre%20Bair">Deirdre Bair</a> alleges that Guiler knew what was happening while Nin was in California, but consciously "chose not to know".

Nin referred to her simultaneous marriages as her "bicoastal trapeze". According to Deidre Bair: 

In 1966, Nin had her marriage with Pole annulled, due to the legal issues arising from both Guiler and Pole trying to claim her as a dependent on their federal <a href="Tax%20return%20%28United%20States%29">tax return</a>s. Though the marriage was annulled, Nin and Pole continued to live together as if they were married, up until her death in 1977. According to Barbara Kraft, prior to her death Anaïs had written to Hugh Guiler asking for his forgiveness. He responded writing how meaningful his life had been because of her.

After Guiler's death in 1985, the <a href="expurgation">unexpurgated</a> versions of her journals were commissioned by Pole. Five volumes have appeared ("<a href="Henry%20and%20June">Henry and June</a>", "", "", "<a href="Nearer%20the%20Moon">Nearer the Moon</a>", and ""). Pole died in July 2006.

Nin often cited authors <a href="Djuna%20Barnes">Djuna Barnes</a> and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations. She states in Volume One of her diaries that she drew inspiration from <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>, <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>, <a href="Paul%20Val%C3%A9ry">Paul Valéry</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Arthur Rimbaud</a>.

Nin once worked at Lawrence R. Maxwell Books, located at <a href="45%20Christopher%20Street">45 Christopher Street</a> in New York City. In addition to her work as a writer, Nin appeared in the <a href="Kenneth%20Anger">Kenneth Anger</a> film "<a href="Inauguration%20of%20the%20Pleasure%20Dome">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</a>" (1954) as <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a>; in the <a href="Maya%20Deren">Maya Deren</a> film "Ritual in Transfigured Time" (1946); and in "Bells of Atlantis" (1952), a film directed by Guiler under the name "Ian Hugo" with a soundtrack of <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> by <a href="Louis%20and%20Bebe%20Barron">Louis and Bebe Barron</a>.

Anaïs Nin's most important works, in the judgment of both herself and scholars, are her diaries or journals. The journals, which span several decades, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysts</a>, and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially <a href="Otto%20Rank">Otto Rank</a>. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.

Previously unpublished works are coming to light in "A Café in Space, the Anaïs Nin Literary Journal", which includes "Anaïs Nin and Joaquín Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony—Letters between a father and daughter."

So far sixteen volumes of her journals have been published. All but the last five of her adult journals are in expurgated form.

Nin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of <a href="Women%27s%20erotica">female erotica</a>. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of <a href="erotic%20literature">erotic writing</a>, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of <a href="Kate%20Chopin">Kate Chopin</a>.

According to Volume I of her diaries, 1931–1934, published in 1966 (Stuhlmann), Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: "One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me. I had never read erotic literature in America… They overwhelmed me. I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits… I had my degree in erotic lore."
Faced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Henry Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous "collector" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke. (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.) Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as "<a href="Delta%20of%20Venus">Delta of Venus</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Birds">Little Birds</a>".

Nin was a friend, and in some cases lover, of many leading literary figures, including <a href="Henry%20Miller">Henry Miller</a>, <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, <a href="Antonin%20Artaud">Antonin Artaud</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a>, <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>, <a href="James%20Agee">James Agee</a>, <a href="James%20Leo%20Herlihy">James Leo Herlihy</a>, and <a href="Lawrence%20Durrell">Lawrence Durrell</a>. Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Nin wrote about her infatuation with the <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a> artist <a href="Bridget%20Bate%20Tichenor">Bridget Bate Tichenor</a> in her diaries. Claims that Nin was <a href="bisexual">bisexual</a> were given added circulation by the <a href="Philip%20Kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> film "<a href="Henry%20%26amp%3B%20June">Henry & June</a>" about <a href="Henry%20Miller">Henry Miller</a> and his second wife <a href="June%20Miller">June Miller</a>. The first unexpurgated portion of Nin's journal to be published, "<a href="Henry%20and%20June">Henry and June</a>", makes it clear that Nin was stirred by June to the point of saying (paraphrasing), "I have become June," though it is unclear whether she consummated her feelings for her sexually. To both Anaïs and Henry, June was a femme fatale—irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke.

In the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, "Incest", she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207–15). When Nin's father learned of the title of her first book of fiction, "<a href="House%20of%20Incest">House of Incest</a>", he feared that the nature of the abuse would be revealed, when, in fact, it was heavily veiled in Nin's text.

The explosion of the <a href="feminist%20movement">feminist movement</a> in the 1960s gave feminist perspectives on Nin's writings of the past twenty years, which made Nin a popular lecturer at various universities; contrarily, Nin disassociated herself from the political activism of the movement.

In 1973 Anaïs Nin received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from the <a href="Philadelphia%20College%20of%20Art">Philadelphia College of Art</a>. She was elected to the United States <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters">National Institute of Arts and Letters</a> in 1974. In 1976 she was presented with a <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a> Woman of the Year award. She died in Los Angeles on January 14, 1977, three years after being diagnosed with <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. Her body was <a href="cremation">cremated</a>, and her ashes were scattered over <a href="Santa%20Monica%20Bay">Santa Monica Bay</a> in Mermaid Cove. Her first husband, Hugh Guiler, died in 1985, and his ashes were scattered in the cove as well. Rupert Pole was named Nin's <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a>, and he arranged to have new, unexpurgated editions of Nin's books and diaries published between 1985 and his death in 2006. Large portions of the diaries are still available only in the expurgated form. The originals are located in the <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a> library.

<a href="Philip%20Kaufman">Philip Kaufman</a> directed the 1990 film "<a href="Henry%20%26amp%3B%20June">Henry & June</a>" based on Nin's novel "<a href="Henry%20and%20June">Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin</a>". She was portrayed in the film by <a href="Maria%20de%20Medeiros">Maria de Medeiros</a>.

In February 2008, Los Angeles poet <a href="Steven%20Reigns">Steven Reigns</a> organized Anaïs Nin @ 105 at the Hammer Museum. Reigns said: "Nin bonded and formed very deep friendships with women and men decades younger than her. Some of them are still living in Los Angeles and I thought it'd be wonderful to have them share their experiences with [Nin]." <a href="Bebe%20Barron">Bebe Barron</a>, electronic music pioneer and longtime friend of Nin, made her last public appearance at Anaïs Nin @ 105. Reigns also published an essay refuting Bern Porter’s claims of a sexual relationship with Nin in the 1930s.

The Cuban poet and novelist <a href="Wendy%20Guerra">Wendy Guerra</a>, long fascinated with Nin's life and works, published a fictional diary in Nin's voice, "Posar desnuda en la Habana" ("Posing Nude in Havana") in 2012. She explained that "[Nin's] Cuban Diary has very few pages and my delirium was always to write an apocryphal novel; literary conjecture about what might have happened".

On September 27, 2013, screenwriter and author <a href="Kim%20Krizan">Kim Krizan</a> published an article in "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" revealing she had found a previously unpublished love letter written by <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> to Nin. This letter contradicts Gore Vidal's previous characterization of his relationship with Nin, showing that Vidal did have feelings for Nin that he later heavily disavowed in his autobiography, "Palimpsest". Krizan did this research in the run up to the release of the latest volume of Anaïs Nin's uncensored diary, "Mirages", for which Krizan provided the foreword.

AOL Instant Messenger

AIM (previously AOL (America Online) Instant Messenger) is an <a href="instant%20messaging">instant messaging</a> and <a href="presence%20information">presence</a> <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a> which uses the <a href="proprietary%20software">proprietary</a> <a href="OSCAR%20protocol">OSCAR instant messaging protocol</a> and the <a href="TOC%20protocol">TOC protocol</a> to allow registered users to communicate in real time.

AIM was popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s in North America, and was the leading instant messaging application in that region. AIM's popularity declined steeply at the end of the decade, and its fall has often been compared with other once-popular internet services such as <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a>.

AOL Instant Messenger was initially integrated into <a href="AOL%20Desktop">AOL Desktop</a> and later also released as a stand-alone download by <a href="America%20Online">America Online</a> (AOL) in May 1997 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. The software, maintained by AOL, Inc., at one time had the largest share of the instant messaging market in North America, especially in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> (with 52% of the total reported ). This does not include other instant messaging software related to or developed by AOL, such as <a href="ICQ">ICQ</a> and <a href="iChat">iChat</a>.

Its main competitors during its heyday were <a href="ICQ">ICQ</a>, <a href="Yahoo%21%20Messenger">Yahoo! Messenger</a> and <a href="MSN%20Messenger">MSN Messenger</a>. AOL particularly had a rivalry or 'chat war' with rival <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> starting in 1999. There were several attempts from Microsoft to simultaneously log into their own and AIM's protocol servers. AOL were not happy about this and started blocking MSN Messenger from being able to access AIM.

AIM went officially mobile in early 2008 when the application was released for <a href="Windows%20Mobile">Windows Mobile</a> devices and allowed for all devices to send IMs via SMS. However AIM could already be used on various devices beforehand with third-party applications, and as early as 2002 on a <a href="Danger%20Hiptop">Sidekick</a>.

Since 2012, stand-alone official AIM client software includes advertisements and is available for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="Windows%20Mobile">Windows Mobile</a>, <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Classic Mac OS</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>, <a href="iOS%20%28Apple%29">iOS</a>, <a href="BlackBerry%20OS">BlackBerry OS</a>.

Around 2011 AIM started to lose popularity rapidly, partly due to the quick rise of <a href="Gmail">Gmail</a> and its built-in real-name <a href="Google%20Chat">Google Chat</a> instant messenger integration in 2011 and because many people started purely moving onto <a href="Short%20Message%20Service">SMS</a> <a href="text%20messaging">text messaging</a> and later <a href="social%20networking">social networking</a> websites for instant messaging.

, one source reported AOL Instant Messenger market share had collapsed to 0.73%. However, this number only reflects installed IM applications, and not active users. The engineers responsible for AIM claimed that they were unable to convince AOL management that free was the future.

On March 3, 2012, AOL got rid of all the developing staff for AIM, effectively ending development of the application after 15 years. However the service is still active and help support is still provided.

The AIM mascot was designed by JoRoan Lazaro and was implemented in the first release in 1997. This was a yellow <a href="stick%20figures">stickman</a>-like figure, often called the 'Running Man'. The mascot appeared on all AIM logos and most wordmarks, and always appeared at the top of the buddy list. AIM's incredible popularity in the late 1990s and the 2000s led to the Running Man becoming a familiar brand on the internet. After over 14 years, the iconic logo was finally disappeared as part of the AIM rebranding in 2011. However, in August 2013 the Running Man once again returned.

In 2014, a "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" editor called it a "symbol of America". In April 2015 the Running Man was officially featured in the <a href="Virgin%20London%20Marathon">Virgin London Marathon</a>, dressed by a person for the AOL-partnered <a href="Free%20The%20Children">Free The Children</a> charity.

The standard protocol that AIM clients use to communicate is called <a href="OSCAR%20protocol">Open System for CommunicAtion in Realtime</a> (OSCAR). Most AOL-produced versions of AIM and popular third party AIM clients use this protocol. However, AOL also created a simpler protocol called <a href="TOC2%20protocol">TOC</a> that lacks many of OSCAR's features but is sometimes used for clients that only require basic chat functionality. The TOC/TOC2 protocol specifications were made available by AOL, while OSCAR is a closed protocol that third parties have had to reverse-engineer.

In January 2008, AOL introduced experimental <a href="Extensible%20Messaging%20and%20Presence%20Protocol">Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol</a> (XMPP) support for AIM, allowing AIM users to communicate using the standardized, open-source XMPP. However, in iCloud. 2008, this service was dying. In May 2011, AOL started offering limited XMPP support. On March 1, 2017, AOL announced (via XMPP-login-time messages) that the AOL XMPP gateway would be desupported, effective March 28, 2017.

For privacy regulations, AIM has strict age restrictions. AIM accounts are available only for people over the age of 13; children younger than that are not permitted access to AIM.

Under the AIM Privacy Policy, AOL has no rights to read or monitor any private communications between users. The profile of the user has no privacy.

If public content is accessed. it can be used for online, print or even broadcast advertising, etc. This is outlined in the policy and terms of service: "... you grant AOL, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to reproduce, display, perform, distribute, adapt and promote this Content in any medium". This allows anything one posts to be used without a separate request for permission.

The issue of AIM's security has been called into question. AOL states that it has taken great steps to insure that personal information will not be accessed by unauthorized members, but that it cannot guarantee that that will not happen.

AIM is different from other clients, such as <a href="Yahoo%21%20Messenger">Yahoo! Messenger</a>, in that it does not require approval from one buddy to be added to another's buddy list. As a result, it is possible for users to keep other unsuspecting users on their buddy list to see when they are online, read their status and away messages, and read their profiles. In fact, there is a Web API to display one's status and away message as a widget on one's Web page. However, one can block another user from communicating and seeing one's status, but this does not prevent the user from creating a new account that is not blocked and therefore can still track the first user's status. A more complete privacy option is to select a menu option allowing communication only with those on one's buddy list; this causes blocking (thus appearing offline to) all users who are not on one's buddy list.

AOL and various other companies supply robots on AIM that can receive messages and send a response based on the bot's purpose. For example, bots can help with studying, like StudyBuddy. Some are made to relate to children and teenagers, like <a href="Spleak">Spleak</a>, others give advice, and others are for more general purposes, such as <a href="SmarterChild">SmarterChild</a>. The more useful chat bots have features like the ability to play games, get sport scores, weather forecasts or financial stock information. Users were able to talk to automated chat bots that could respond to natural human language. They were primarily put into place as a marketing strategy and for unique advertising options. It was used by advertisers to market products or build better consumer relations.

Before the inclusions of such bots, the other bots DoorManBot and AIMOffline provided features that are provided today by AOL for those who needed it. <a href="ZolaOnAOL">ZolaOnAOL</a> and <a href="ZoeOnAOL">ZoeOnAOL</a> were short lived bots that ultimately retired their features in favor of <a href="SmarterChild">SmarterChild</a>. As of November 18, 2008, the <a href="SmarterChild">SmarterChild</a> bot for AIM was retired and is no longer offering any services.

AOL Instant Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra <a href="URI%20scheme">URI scheme</a> ("protocol") handler into some Web browsers, so URIs beginning "aim:" can open a new AIM window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the mailto: URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a Web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the AIM user "notarealuser":

To specify a message body, the codice_2 parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:

To specify an away message, the message parameter is used, so the link location might look like this:
When placing this inside a URL link, an AIM user could click on the URL link and the away message "Hello, my name is Bill" would instantly become their away message.

To add a buddy, the addbuddy message is used, with the screenname parameter
This type of link is commonly found on forum profiles, to easily add contacts

AIM has security weaknesses that have enabled <a href="exploit%20%28computer%20security%29">exploits</a> to be created that use third-party software to perform malicious acts on users' computers. Although most are relatively harmless, such as being kicked off the AIM service, others perform potentially dangerous actions such as sending <a href="computer%20virus">viruses</a>. Some of these exploits rely on <a href="social%20engineering%20%28computer%20security%29">social engineering</a> to spread by automatically sending instant messages that contain a <a href="Uniform%20Resource%20Locator">URL</a> accompanied by text suggesting the receiving user click on it, an action which leads to infection. These messages can easily be mistaken as coming from a friend and contain a link to a Web address that installs software on the user's computer to restart the cycle.

Users have also reported sudden additions of toolbars and advertisements from third parties in the newer version of AIM. Multiple complaints about the lack of control of third party involvement have caused many users to stop using the service.

On March 6, 2008, during <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>'s <a href="iPhone%20SDK">iPhone SDK</a> event, AOL announced that they would be releasing an AIM application for <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> users. The application is available for free from the App Store, but the company also provides a paid version, which displays no advertisements. Both are available from the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a>. The AIM client for <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> supports standard AIM accounts as well as <a href="MobileMe">MobileMe</a> accounts. There is also an express version of AIM accessible through the <a href="Safari%20%28web%20browser%29">Safari</a> browser on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

In 2011 AOL launched a massive overhaul of their Instant Messaging service. Included in the update was a brand new <a href="iOS">iOS</a> application for <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a> which incorporated all the latest features. A brand new icon was used for the application, featuring the new cursive logo for AIM. The user-interface was entirely redone for the features including: a new buddy list, group messaging, in-line photos and videos, as well as improved file-sharing.

Currently the application is in version 5.0.5, which was updated as of March 2012. In the latest iteration, it supports more social stream features, much like Facebook and Twitter, as well as the ability to send voice messages up to 60 seconds long.

On April 3, 2010 Apple released the first generation iPad. Along with this newly released device AOL released the AIM application for iPad. It was built entirely from scratch for the new version iOS with a specialized user-interface for the device. It supports geo location, Facebook status updates and chat, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare and many social networking platforms.

AIM Express ran in a pop-up browser window. It was intended for use by people who are unwilling or unable to install a standalone application or those at computers that lack the AIM application. AIM Express supported many of the standard features included in the stand-alone client, but did not provide advanced features like file transfer, audio chat, video conferencing, or buddy info. It was implemented in <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash</a>. It was an upgrade to the prior AOL Quick Buddy, which was later available for older systems that cannot handle Express before being discontinued. Express and Quick Buddy were similar to <a href="MSN%20Messenger%23MSN%20Web%20Messenger">MSN Web Messenger</a> and <a href="Yahoo%21%20Messenger%23Web%20Messenger">Yahoo! Web Messenger</a>. This web version has evolved into AIM.com's web-based messenger.

AIM Pages was released in May 2006, allowing the 63 million AIM users to create an online, dynamic profile. The buddy list serves as the basis for the AIM Page <a href="social%20networking%20service">social networking service</a>. An AIM Page is built using modules following the ModuleT <a href="microformat">microformat</a>. AIM Pages was discontinued in late 2007.

AOL released an all-new AIM for the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> on September 29, 2008 and the final build on December 15, 2008. The redesigned AIM for Mac is a full <a href="universal%20binary">universal binary</a> <a href="Cocoa%20API">Cocoa API</a> application that supports both Tiger and Leopard – <a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a> 10.4.8 (and above) or Mac OS X 10.5.3 (and above). On October 1, 2009, AOL released AIM 2.0 for Mac.

This feature is available for AIM 7 and allows for a user to see what the other is typing as it is being done. It was developed and built with assistance from Trace Research and Development Centre at <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> and <a href="Gallaudet%20University">Gallaudet University</a>. The application provides visually impaired users the ability to convert messages from text (words) to speech. For the application to work users must have AIM 6.8 or higher, as it is not compatible with older versions of AIM software, AIM for Mac or iChat.

This feature allows <a href="text%20messaging">text messaging</a> to a phone number (<a href="messaging%23Increasing%20competition">text messaging is less functional</a> than instant messaging).

AIM Phoneline was a <a href="Voice%20over%20IP">Voice over IP</a> PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service provided via the AIM application. It was also known to work with Apple's iChat Client.

Launched on May 16, 2006, AIM Phoneline provided users the ability to have several local numbers, allowing AIM users to receive free incoming calls. The service allowed users to make calls to landlines and mobile devices through the use of a computer. The service, however, was only free for receiving and AOL charged users $14.95 a month for unlimited calling plan.

In order to use AIM Phoneline users had to install the latest free version of AIM Triton software and needed a good set of headphones with a boom microphone. It could take several days after a user signed up before it started working.

The service provided users with many interfaces such as Auto Action APIs, Ringback Tone APIs and Screen Name Services API that made the AIM Phoneline a great service.

On January 13, 2009, the service was officially closed. The closing of the free service caused the number associated with the service to be disabled and not transferrable for a different service.

AIM Call Out is a discontinued <a href="Voice%20over%20IP">Voice over IP</a> PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service provided by AOL via its AIM application that replaced the defunct AIM Phoneline service in November 2007. It did not depend on the AIM client and could be used with only an AIM screenname via the WebConnect feature or a dedicated SIP device. The AIM Call Out service was shut down on March 25, 2009.

On November 4, 2014, AIM scored 1 out of 7 points on the <a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>'s secure messaging scorecard. AIM received a point for encryption during transit but lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesn't have access to (i.e. the communications are not <a href="End-to-end%20encryption">end-to-end encrypted</a>), users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e. the service does not provide <a href="forward%20secrecy">forward secrecy</a>), the code is not open to independent review (i.e. the code is not <a href="Open-source%20software">open-source</a>), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent security audit. <a href="BlackBerry%20Messenger">BlackBerry Messenger</a>, <a href="eBuddy">Ebuddy XMS</a>, <a href="Hushmail">Hushmail</a>, <a href="Kik%20Messenger">Kik Messenger</a>, <a href="Skype">Skype</a>, <a href="Viber">Viber</a>, and <a href="Yahoo%21%20Messenger">Yahoo Messenger</a> also scored 1 out of 7 points.

<doc id="2925" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2925" title="Ackermann function">
Ackermann function

In <a href="computability%20theory">computability theory</a>, the Ackermann function, named after <a href="Wilhelm%20Ackermann">Wilhelm Ackermann</a>, is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a <a href="total%20function">total</a> <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a> that is not <a href="Primitive%20recursive%20function">primitive recursive</a>. All primitive recursive functions are total and computable, but the Ackermann function illustrates that not all total computable functions are primitive recursive.

After Ackermann's publication of his function (which had three nonnegative integer arguments), many authors modified it to suit various purposes, so that today "the Ackermann function" may refer to any of numerous variants of the original function. One common version, the two-argument Ackermann–Péter function, is defined as follows for nonnegative integers "m" and "n":

Its value grows rapidly, even for small inputs. For example, "A"(4,2) is an integer of 19,729 decimal digits.

In the late 1920s, the mathematicians <a href="Gabriel%20Sudan">Gabriel Sudan</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Ackermann">Wilhelm Ackermann</a>, students of <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, were studying the foundations of computation. Both Sudan and Ackermann are credited with discovering <a href="total%20function">total</a> <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a>s (termed simply "recursive" in some references) that are not <a href="primitive%20recursive%20function">primitive recursive</a>. Sudan published the lesser-known <a href="Sudan%20function">Sudan function</a>, then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function formula_2 (the Greek letter "<a href="phi">phi</a>"). Ackermann's three-argument function, formula_3, is defined such that for "p" = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of <a href="addition">addition</a>, <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a>, and <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a> as
and for "p" > 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that can be compared to the <a href="hyperoperation">hyperoperation</a>s:

In "On the Infinite", David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert’s personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper "On Hilbert’s Construction of the Real Numbers".

<a href="R%C3%B3zsa%20P%C3%A9ter">Rózsa Péter</a> and <a href="Raphael%20Robinson">Raphael Robinson</a> later developed a two-variable version of the Ackermann function that became preferred by many authors.

Ackermann's original three-argument function formula_3 is defined <a href="recursion">recursively</a> as follows for nonnegative integers "m", "n", and "p":

Of the various two-argument versions, the one developed by Péter and Robinson (called "the" Ackermann function by some authors) is defined for nonnegative integers "m" and "n" as follows:

It may not be immediately obvious that the evaluation of formula_10 always terminates. However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either "m" decreases, or "m" remains the same and "n" decreases. Each time that "n" reaches zero, "m" decreases, so "m" eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair ("m", "n") decreases in the <a href="lexicographic%20order">lexicographic order</a> on pairs, which is a <a href="well-order">well-order</a>ing, just like the ordering of single non-negative integers; this means one cannot go down in the ordering infinitely many times in succession.) However, when "m" decreases there is no upper bound on how much "n" can increase—and it will often increase greatly.

The Péter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:


For small values of "m" like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to "n" (at most <a href="exponential%20growth">exponentially</a>). For "m" ≥ 4, however, it grows much more quickly; even "A"(4, 2) is about 2, and the decimal expansion of "A"(4, 3) is very large by any typical measure.

One interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.

A single-argument version f(n) = A(n, n) that increases both "m" and "n" at the same time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the <a href="exponential%20function">exponential function</a>, the factorial function, multi- and <a href="superfactorial">superfactorial</a> functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that f(n) is roughly comparable to f(n) in the <a href="fast-growing%20hierarchy">fast-growing hierarchy</a>. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that "f", which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a> and so is a <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a>, grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.

In a category with <a href="Exponential%20object">exponentials</a>, using the isomorphism formula_17 (in computer science, this is called <a href="currying">currying</a>), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:

where is the usual <a href="successor%20function">successor function</a> and Iter denotes the <a href="functional%20power">functional power</a> operator, defined by primitive recursion as well:

The function formula_20 defined in this way agrees with the Ackermann function formula_21 defined above: formula_22.

To see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, we can fully evaluate formula_23 in the following way:

To demonstrate how formula_25's computation results in many steps and in a large number:

Computing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. We place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left, then look up the required number in the previous row, at the position given by the number just taken. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed "1" in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:

! "m"\"n"
! 0
! 1
! 2

This inverse appears in the time <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">complexity</a> of some <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s, such as the <a href="disjoint-set%20data%20structure">disjoint-set data structure</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Chazelle">Chazelle</a>'s algorithm for <a href="minimum%20spanning%20tree">minimum spanning tree</a>s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the "−3" and similar terms.

A two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where formula_39 is the <a href="floor%20function">floor function</a>:
This function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, "m" represents the number of operations while "n" represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, "m" represents the number of edges while "n" represents the number of vertices.
Several slightly different definitions of α("m", "n") exist; for example, log "n" is sometimes replaced by "n", and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a <a href="ceiling%20function">ceiling</a>.

Other studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.

The Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a <a href="compiler">compiler</a>'s ability to optimize recursion. The first published use of Ackermann's function in this way was in 1971 by Yngve Sundblad.

Sundblad's seminal paper was taken up by Brian Wichmann (co-author of the <a href="Whetstone%20%28benchmark%29">Whetstone benchmark</a>) in a trilogy of papers written between 1975 and 1982.

Antarctic

The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a <a href="polar%20region">polar region</a>, specifically the <a href="region">region</a> around the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a>, opposite the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> region around the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> and the island territories located on the <a href="Antarctic%20Plate">Antarctic Plate</a>. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the <a href="ice%20shelf">ice shelves</a>, waters, and <a href="island">island</a> territories in the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> situated south of the <a href="Antarctic%20Convergence">Antarctic Convergence</a>, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and <a href="ice%20shelf">ice shelves</a> south of <a href="60th%20parallel%20south">60°S latitude</a> are administrated under the <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty%20System">Antarctic Treaty System</a>. In a <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> sense, the <a href="Antarctic%20ecozone">Antarctic ecozone</a> is one of eight <a href="ecozone">ecozone</a>s of the Earth's land surface.

The maritime part of the region constitutes the area of application of the international <a href="Convention%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Antarctic%20Marine%20Living%20Resources">Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources</a> (CCAMLR), where for technical reasons the Convention uses an approximation of the Convergence line by means of a line joining specified points along <a href="Circle%20of%20latitude">parallels of latitude</a> and <a href="Meridian%20%28geography%29">meridians of longitude</a>. The implementation of the Convention is managed through an international Commission headquartered in <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>, Australia, by an efficient system of annual <a href="fishing">fishing</a> quotas, licenses and international inspectors on the fishing vessels, as well as <a href="satellite">satellite</a> surveillance.

Most of the Antarctic region is situated south of 60°S latitude parallel, and is governed in accordance with the international legal regime of the <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty%20System">Antarctic Treaty System</a>. The Treaty area covers the continent itself and its immediately adjacent islands, as well as the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>s of the <a href="South%20Orkney%20Islands">South Orkney Islands</a>, <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a>, <a href="Peter%20I%20Island">Peter I Island</a>, <a href="Scott%20Island">Scott Island</a> and <a href="Balleny%20Islands">Balleny Islands</a>.

The islands situated between 60°S latitude parallel to the south and the <a href="Antarctic%20Convergence">Antarctic Convergence</a> to the north, and their respective <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a>s fall under the national jurisdiction of the countries that possess them: <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a> (United Kingdom; also an <a href="European%20Union">EU</a> <a href="Overseas%20Countries%20and%20Territories%23Overseas%20countries%20and%20territories">Overseas territory</a>), <a href="Bouvet%20Island">Bouvet Island</a> (Norway), and <a href="Heard%20Island%20and%20McDonald%20Islands">Heard and McDonald Islands</a> (Australia).

<a href="Kerguelen%20Islands">Kerguelen Islands</a> (France; also an EU Overseas territory) are situated in the Antarctic Convergence area, while the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, <a href="Isla%20de%20los%20Estados">Isla de los Estados</a>, <a href="Hornos%20Island">Hornos Island</a> with <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, <a href="Diego%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20Islands">Diego Ramírez Islands</a>, <a href="Campbell%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Campbell Island</a>, <a href="Macquarie%20Island">Macquarie Island</a>, <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Saint-Paul">Saint Paul</a> Islands, <a href="Crozet%20Islands">Crozet Islands</a>, <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Islands">Prince Edward Islands</a>, and <a href="Gough%20Island">Gough Island</a> and <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha">Tristan da Cunha group</a> remain north of the Convergence and thus outside the Antarctic region.

A variety of animals live in Antarctica for at least some of the year, including:

Most of the Antarctic continent is permanently covered by ice and snow; less than 1% of the land is exposed. There are only two species of flowering plant, <a href="Antarctic%20hair%20grass">Antarctic hair grass</a> and <a href="Antarctic%20pearlwort">Antarctic pearlwort</a>, but a range of <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="liverwort">liverwort</a>s, <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s and <a href="macrofungi">macrofungi</a>.

The first Antarctic land discovered was the island of <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands%23Geography">South Georgia</a>, visited by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> merchant <a href="Anthony%20de%20la%20Roch%C3%A9">Anthony de la Roché</a> in 1675. Although myths and speculation about a "<a href="Terra%20Australis">Terra Australis</a>" ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent of <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the <a href="List%20of%20Russian%20explorers">Russian expedition</a> of <a href="Fabian%20Gottlieb%20von%20Bellingshausen">Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen</a> and <a href="Mikhail%20Lazarev">Mikhail Lazarev</a> on "<a href="Vostok%20%28sloop-of-war%29">Vostok</a>" and "<a href="Mirny%20%28sloop-of-war%29">Mirny</a>". The first human born in the Antarctic was <a href="Solveig%20Gunbj%C3%B8rg%20Jacobsen">Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen</a> born on 8 October 1913 in <a href="Grytviken">Grytviken</a>, South Georgia.

The Antarctic region had no <a href="indigenous%20population">indigenous population</a> when first discovered, and its present inhabitants comprise a few thousand transient <a href="science">scientific</a> and other personnel working on tours of duty at the several dozen <a href="Research%20stations%20in%20Antarctica">research stations</a> maintained by various countries. However, the region is visited by more than 40,000 tourists annually, the most popular destinations being the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a> area (especially the <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a>) and <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands%23Geography">South Georgia Island</a>.

In December 2009, the growth of <a href="Tourism%20in%20Antarctica">tourism</a>, with consequences for both the ecology and the safety of the travellers in its great and remote wilderness, was noted at a conference in New Zealand by experts from signatories to the <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>. The definitive results of the conference was presented at the Antarctic Treaty states' meeting in Uruguay in May 2010.

The Antarctic hosts the world's largest <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a> comprising 1.07 million km, the South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Marine Protection Area created in 2012. The latter exceeds the surface area of another vast protected territory, the <a href="Greenland%20National%20Park">Greenland National Park</a>’s 972,000 km. (While the <a href="Ross%20Sea">Ross Sea</a> Marine Protection Area established in 2016 is still larger at 1.55 million km, its protection is set to expire in 35 years.)

Because Antarctica surrounds the South Pole, it is theoretically located in all <a href="time%20zone">time zone</a>s. For practical purposes, time zones are usually based on <a href="Territorial%20claims%20in%20Antarctica">territorial claims</a> or the time zone of a station's owner country or supply base.

Albanians

Albanians () are a nation and <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>, native to <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and other countries who share a common <a href="Culture%20of%20Albania">culture</a>, <a href="Cultural%20heritage">ancestry</a> and speak the <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> as a native tongue. Legally, the term is used to refer to the citizens of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Albania">Republic of Albania</a>. Ethnic Albanians speak the <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> and more than half of ethnic Albanians live in <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. A large Albanian population lives in <a href="Albanians%20in%20greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="Albanians%20in%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, with smaller Albanian populations located in <a href="Albanians%20in%20Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Albanians%20in%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a>.

Albanians produced many prominent figures such as <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>, leader of the medieval Albanian resistance to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> conquest and others during the <a href="Albanian%20National%20Awakening">Albanian National Awakening</a> seeking self-determination. During the 17th and 18th century Albanians in large numbers converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, often to escape higher taxes levied on Christian subjects as well as a plethora of other reasons including ecclesiastical decay, coercion by Ottoman authorities in times of war, and the privileged legal and social position of Muslims. As Muslims, some Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world. Albania gained its independence in 1912 and between 1945–1992, Albanians lived under a repressive communist regime. Albanians within <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> underwent periods of discrimination and eventual self-determination that concluded with the breakup of that state in the early 1990s culminating with Albanians living in new countries and Kosovo. Outside the southwestern Balkans of where Albanians have traditionally been located, Albanian populations through the course of history have formed new communities contributing to the cultural, economic, social and political life of their host populations and countries while also at times assimilating too.

Between the 11th and 18th centuries, sizable numbers of Albanians migrated from the area of contemporary Albania to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest. One population which became the <a href="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> settled down in southern Greece who starting from the 16th century though mainly during the 19th century onwards assimilated and today self identify as Greeks. Another population, who became the <a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people">Arbëreshë</a> settled in southern Italy and form the oldest continuous <a href="Albanian%20diaspora">Albanian diaspora</a> producing influential and many prominent figures. Smaller populations dating to migrations during the 18th century are located on Croatia's <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>n coast and scattered communities across southern Ukraine.

The <a href="Albanian%20diaspora">Albanian diaspora</a> also exists in a number of other countries. One of these is located in <a href="Albanians%20in%20Turkey">Turkey</a>. It was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration for economic reasons and later sociopolitical circumstances of discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in <a href="Balkans">Balkan countries</a>. Due to the Ottoman legacy, smaller populations of Albanians also exist in Egypt and the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, in particular Syria. In Western countries, a large and influential Albanian population exists in the <a href="Albanian%20Americans">United States</a> formed from continuous emigration dating back to the 19th century. Other Albanians populations due to emigration between the 19th and 21th centuries are located in <a href="Albanian%20Australians">Australia</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Albanian%20Canadians">Canada</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, France, Sweden, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Albanians%20of%20Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Albanians%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>.

The Albanians () and their country Albania () have been identified by many <a href="Ethnonym">ethnonyms</a>. The most common native <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> is "Shqiptar", plural "Shqiptarë"; the name "Albanians" (<a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a>: "Albanoi/Arbanitai/Arbanites"; <a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "Albanenses/Arbanenses") was used in medieval documents, that gradually entered <a href="European%20Languages">European languages</a> from which other similar derivative names emerged. 

From these <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a>s, names for Albanians were also derived in other languages, that were or still are in use. In <a href="English%20language">English</a> "Albanians"; <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> "Albanesi"; <a href="German%20language">German</a> "Albaner"; <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "Arvanites", "Alvanitis" (Αλβανίτης) plural: "Alvanites" (Αλβανίτες), "Alvanos" (Αλβανός) plural: "Alvanoi" (Αλβανοί); <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> "Arnaut", "Arnavut"; <a href="South%20Slavic%20languages">South Slavic languages</a> "Arbanasi", "Albanci" (Албанци); <a href="Aromanian%20language">Aromanian</a> "Arbineş" and so on. 

The term for a people located in the area of Albania is first encountered in the works of Byzantine historian <a href="Michael%20Attaliates">Michael Attaliates</a>. He referred to them as "Albanoi" having taken part in a revolt against the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in 1043 and to the "Arbanitai" as subjects of the Duke of Dyrrachium (modern <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a>). These references have been disputed as to whether they refer to Albanians in an ethnic sense. A later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078 is undisputed. In later Byzantine usage, the terms "Arbanitai" and "Albanoi" with a range of variants were used interchangeably, while sometimes the same groups were also called by the classicising name Illyrians. The first reference to the Albanian language dates to the latter 13th century (around 1285).

The ethnonym "Albanian" has been hypothesized to be connected to and stem from the "<a href="Albanoi">Albanoi</a>", an Illyrian tribe mentioned by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> with their centre at the city of <a href="Albanopolis">Albanopolis</a>. Linguists believe that the "alb" part in the root word originates from an Indo-European term for a type of mountainous topography, of which other words such as "<a href="alps">alps</a>" is derived from. Through the root word "alban" and its rhotacized equivalents "arban", "albar", and "arbar", the term in Albanian became rendered as "Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë" for the people and "Arbënia/Arbëria" for the country. The Albanian language was referred to as "Arbnisht" and "Arbërisht". While the <a href="exonym">exonym</a> Albania for the general region inhabited by the Albanians does have connotations to Classical Antiquity, the Albanian language employs a different ethnonym, with modern Albanians referring to themselves as "Shqip(ë)tarë" and to their country as "Shqipëria". Two etymologies have been proposed for this ethnonym: one, derived from the etymology from the Albanian word for eagle (shqipe, var., shqiponjë). In Albanian <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a>, this word denotes a bird <a href="totem">totem</a>, dating from the times of Skanderbeg as displayed on the <a href="Albanian%20flag">Albanian flag</a>. The other is within scholarship that connects it to the verb 'to speak' ("me shqiptue") from the Latin ""excipere"". In this instance the Albanian endonym like "<a href="Slav%20%28ethnonym%29">Slav</a>" <a href="Endonym%23Tendencies%20in%20the%20development%20of%20exonyms">and others</a> would originally have been a term connoting "those who speak [intelligibly, the same language]". The new ethnonyms "Shqip(ë)tarë" and "Shqipëria" emerged and replaced the older ethnonyms "Arbëneshë/Arbëreshë" and "Arbënia/Arbëria" between the late 17th and early 18th centuries. That era brought about religious and other sociopolitical changes. As such a new and generalised response by Albanians based on ethnic and linguistic consciousness to this new and different Ottoman world emerging around them was a change in ethnonym.

What is possibly the earliest written reference to the Albanians is that to be found in an old Bulgarian text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century. It was discovered in a Serbian manuscript dated 1628 and was first published in 1934 by Radoslav Grujic. This fragment of a legend from the time of <a href="Tsar%20Samuel">Tsar Samuel</a> endeavours, in a catechismal 'question and answer' form, to explain the origins of peoples and languages. It divides the world into seventy-two languages and three religious categories: Orthodox, half-believers (i.e. non-Orthodox Christians) and non-believers. The Albanians find their place among the nations of half-believers. If the dating of Grujic is accepted, which is based primarily upon the contents of the text as a whole, this would be the earliest written document referring to the Albanians as a people or language group.

It can be seen that there are various languages on earth. Of them, there are five Orthodox languages: Bulgarian, Greek, Syrian, Iberian (Georgian) and Russian. Three of these have Orthodox alphabets: Greek, Bulgarian and Iberian. There are twelve languages of half-believers: Alamanians, <a href="Franks">Franks</a>, Magyars (Hungarians), Indians, Jacobites, Armenians, <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, Lechs (Poles), Arbanasi (Albanians), Croatians, Hizi, Germans.

The first undisputed mention of Albanians in the historical record is attested in Byzantine source for the first time in 1079–1080, in a work titled "History" by Byzantine historian <a href="Michael%20Attaliates">Michael Attaliates</a>, who referred to the "Albanoi" as having taken part in a revolt against <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1043 and to the "Arbanitai" as subjects of the duke of <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Dyrrachium</a>. It is disputed, however, whether the "Albanoi" of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether "Albanoi" is a reference to <a href="Normans">Normans</a> from <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> under an archaic name (there was also a tribe in Italy by the name of "Albanoi"). However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaleiates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion around 1078, is undisputed. At this point, they are already fully Christianized, although <a href="Albanian%20mythology">Albanian mythology</a> and folklore are part of the <a href="Paleo-Balkan%20mythology">Paleo-Balkan</a> pagan mythology, in particular showing Greek influence.

From the late 11th century the Albanians were called Arbën/Arbër and their country as <a href="Arbanon">Arbanon</a>, a mountainous area to the west of Lake Ochrida and the upper valley of the river Shkumbin. It was in 1190, when the rulers of Arbanon (local Albanian noble called <a href="Progon%20of%20Kruja">Progon</a> and his sons Dhimitër and Gjin) created their <a href="Principality%20of%20Arb%C3%ABr">principality</a> with its capital at <a href="Kruj%C3%AB">Krujë</a>. After the fall of <a href="House%20of%20Progon">Progon Dynasty</a> in 1216, the principality came under <a href="Grigor%20Kamona">Grigor Kamona</a> and <a href="Gulam%20of%20Albania">Gulam of Albania</a>. Finally the Principality was dissolved in 1255. Around 1230 the two main centers of Albanian settlements, one around <a href="Devoll%20%28river%29">Devoll river</a> in what is now central Albania, and the other around the region which was known with the name Arbanon.

In 1271 <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Naples">Charles of Anjou</a> created the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">Kingdom of Albania</a>, after he captured a part of the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a>. A major attempt to advance further in direction of Constantinople failed at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Berat%20%281280%E2%80%931281%29">Siege of Berat (1280–1281)</a>. A Byzantine counteroffensive soon ensued, which drove the <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Angevins</a> out of the interior by 1281. The <a href="Sicilian%20Vespers">Sicilian Vespers</a> further weakened the position of Charles, and the Kingdom was soon reduced by the <a href="Epirus%20%28region%29">Epirotes</a> to a small area around <a href="Durr%C3%ABs">Durrës</a>. The kingdom however held out until 1368, when the city was captured by <a href="Karl%20Topia">Karl Thopia</a>. The presence of the kingdom reinforced the influence of Catholicism and the conversion to its rite, not only in the region of Durrës but in other parts of the country. A new wave of Catholic dioceses, churches and monasteries were founded, a number of different religious orders began spreading into the country, and papal missionaries also reached the territories of the Kingdom of Albania. Those who were not Catholic in Central and North Albania converted and a great number of Albanian clerics and monks were present in the Dalmatian Catholic institutions.

In the 14th century a number of <a href="Albanian%20principalities">Albanian principalities</a> were created. These included <a href="Principality%20of%20Kastrioti">Principality of Kastrioti</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Dukagjini">Principality of Dukagjini</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania%20%28medieval%29">Princedom of Albania</a>, and <a href="Principality%20of%20Gjirokast%C3%ABr">Principality of Gjirokastër</a>. At the beginning of the 15th century these principalities became stronger, especially because of the fall of the <a href="Serbian%20Empire">Serbian Empire</a>. Some of these principalities were united in 1444 under the military alliance called <a href="League%20of%20Lezh%C3%AB">League of Lezha</a>.

At the dawn of the establishment of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in <a href="Southeast%20Europe">Southeast Europe</a>, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small <a href="Principalities%20of%20albania">principalities</a>. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout <a href="southern%20Albania">southern Albania</a> by 1415 and established formal jurisdiction over most of Albania by 1431. However, in 1443 a great and longstanding revolt broke under the lead of the Albanian national hero <a href="Gjergj%20Kastrioti%20Skanderbeg">Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg</a>, which lasted until 1479, many times defeating major Ottoman armies led by sultans <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a> and <a href="Mehmed%20the%20Conqueror">Mehmed II</a>. Skanderbeg united initially the Albanian princes and later established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming <a href="Skanderbeg">Lord of Albania</a>. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He frustrated every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples, the papacy, <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, and <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a>. Finally after decades of resistance, Ottomans captured <a href="Siege%20of%20Shkodra">Shkodër in 1479</a> and Durrës in 1501. Skanderbeg's long struggle to keep Albania free became highly significant to the Albanian people, as it strengthened their solidarity, made them more conscious of their national identity, and served later as a great source of inspiration in their struggle for national unity, freedom, and independence. The invasion triggered a several waves of migration of Albanians from Albania, Epirus and <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> to the south of Italy, constituting an <a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people">Arbereshe</a> community. Albanians were recruited all over Europe as a light cavalry known as <a href="stratioti">stratioti</a>. The stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern).
By the 16th century, Ottoman rule over Southeast Europe was largely secure. The Ottomans proceeded in stages, first appointing a <a href="qadi">qadi</a> along with governors and then military retainers in the cities. <a href="Timar">Timar</a> holders, not necessarily converts to Islam, would occasionally rebel, the most famous case of which is <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>. His figure would be used later in the 19th century as a central component of Albanian national identity. Ottoman control over the Albanian territories was secured in 1571 when <a href="Ulcinj">Ulcinj</a>, presently in <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, was captured.

The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual <a href="Islamization">Islamization</a> process of a large majority of the population, although such a process only became widespread in the 17th century. Mainly <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> converted in the 17th century, while the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Orthodox</a> Albanians became <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> mainly in the following century. Initially confined to the main city centres of <a href="Elbasan">Elbasan</a> and <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkodër</a>, by this time the countryside was also embracing the new religion. In Elbasan Muslims made up just over half the population in 1569–70 whereas in Shkodër this was almost 90% and in <a href="Berat">Berat</a> closer to 60%. In the 17th century, however, Catholic conversion to Islam increased, even in the countryside. The motives for conversion according to scholars were diverse, depending on the context. The lack of source-material does not help when investigating such issues. Reasons in various different contexts included the incentive to escape high taxes levied on Christian subjects, ecclesiastical decay, coercion by Ottoman authorities in times of war, and the privileged position Muslims had over Christians in the Empire.

Areas such as Albania, Western Macedonia, Southern Serbia, Kosovo, parts of northern Greece and southern Montenegro in Ottoman sources were referred to as "Arnavudluk" or Albania. The Ottoman period that followed in Albania after the end of Skanderbeg's resistance was characterized by other changes. Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government such as: <a href="Iljaz%20Hoxha">Iljaz Hoxha</a>, <a href="Hamza%20Kastrioti">Hamza Kastrioti</a>, <a href="Koca%20Davud%20Pasha">Koca Davud Pasha</a>, <a href="Za%C4%9Fanos%20Pasha">Zağanos Pasha</a>, <a href="K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC%20Mehmed%20Pasha">Köprülü Mehmed Pasha</a> (head of the Köprülü family of Grand Viziers), the <a href="Bushati%20family">Bushati family</a>, <a href="Sulejman%20Pasha">Sulejman Pasha</a>, <a href="Edhem%20Pasha">Edhem Pasha</a>, <a href="Nezim%20Frakulla">Nezim Frakulla</a>, <a href="Haxhi%20Shekreti">Haxhi Shekreti</a>, <a href="Hasan%20Zyko%20Kamberi">Hasan Zyko Kamberi</a>, <a href="Ali%20Pasha%20of%20Gucia">Ali Pasha of Gucia</a>, <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a> and <a href="Ali%20Pasha%20of%20Tepelena">Ali Pasha of Tepelena</a> who rose to become one of the most powerful Muslim Albanian rulers in western <a href="Rumelia">Rumelia</a>. During the Ottoman era Albanians involved in imperial service could also be found across the empire in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and across the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> as vital military and administrative retainers.

In the 1870s, the <a href="Sublime%20Porte">Sublime Porte</a>'s reforms aimed at checking the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>'s disintegration had clearly failed. The image of the "Turkish yoke" had become fixed in the nationalist mythologies and psyches of the people in the <a href="Balkan%20Peninsula">Balkan peninsula</a>, and their march toward independence quickened. Because of the higher degree of Islamic influence, the Albanians internal social divisions, and the fear that they would lose their <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian-inhabited</a> territories to the emerging Balkan states, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, were the last of the peoples in the Balkans to desire division from the Ottomans. 

The national awakening as a coherent political movement began after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a>, according to which Albanian-inhabited territories were to be ceded to other states of the Balkans, and focused on preventing that partition. The Treaty of San Stefano was the impetus for the nation-building movement, which was based more on fear of partition than national identity. Even after, Albania became <a href="Declaration%20of%20independence%20of%20Albania">independent</a> on 28 November 1912, national identity was fragmented and possible non-existent in much of the new country. The state of disunity and fragmentation would remain until the communist period following <a href="Second%20world%20war">second World War</a>, when the communist nation-building project would achieve greater success in nation-building and reach more people than any previous regime, thus creating Albanian national communist identity.

Approximately 7 million Albanians are to be found within the <a href="Balkan%20peninsula">Balkan peninsula</a> with about half this number residing in <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and the other divided between <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and to a much smaller extent <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, and <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>. An estimated 2.2 million Albanians live in the territory of <a href="Former%20Yugoslavia">Former Yugoslavia</a>, the greater part (close to two million) in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. Rights to use the <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> in education and government were given and guaranteed by the 1974 Constitution of <a href="SFRY">SFRY</a> and were widely utilized in Macedonia and in Montenegro before the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20Yugoslavia">Dissolution of Yugoslavia</a>.

The Albanian presence in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and in the adjacent <a href="Toplica%20District">Toplica</a> and <a href="Moravac">Morava</a> regions is recorded since the medieval period. As the Serbs expelled a large number of Albanians from the wider Toplica and Morava regions in southern Serbia, which the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> of 1878 had given to the <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade Principality</a>, a large number of them settled in Kosovo. In Kosovo they and their descendants are known as "muhaxher" (meaning "the exiled", from the Arabic muhajir).

An estimated 275,000–600,000 Albanians live in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, forming the largest immigrant community in the country. They are economic migrants whose migration began in 1991, following the collapse of the <a href="Socialist%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Albania">Socialist People's Republic of Albania</a>.

The <a href="Arvanites">Arvanites</a> and <a href="Albanian-speakers%20of%20Western%20Thrace">Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace</a> are a group descended from <a href="Tosks">Tosks</a> who migrated to southern and central Greece between the 13th and 16th centuries. They are Greek Orthodox Christians, and though they traditionally speak a dialect of <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosk Albanian</a> known as <a href="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a>, they have fully assimilated into the Greek nation and do not identify as Albanians. Arvanitika is in a state of attrition due to language shift towards Greek and large-scale internal migration to the cities and subsequent intermingling of the population during the 20th century.

The <a href="Cham%20Albanians">Cham Albanians</a> were a group that formerly inhabited a region of <a href="Epirus%20%28region%29">Epirus</a> known as <a href="Chameria">Chameria</a>, nowadays <a href="Thesprotia">Thesprotia</a> in northwestern Greece. Many Cham Albanians converted to Islam during the Ottoman era. <a href="Islam">Muslim</a> Chams were <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Cham%20Albanians">expelled</a> from Greece during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, by an <a href="EDES">anti-communist resistance group</a>, as a result of their participation in a <a href="EAM-ELAS">communist resistance group</a> and the <a href="Axis-Cham%20Albanian%20collaboration">collaboration</a> with the <a href="Axis%20occupation%20of%20Greece%20during%20World%20War%20II">Axis occupation</a>, while Orthodox Chams have largely assimilated into the Greek nation.

Italy has a historical Albanian minority of 260,000 which are scattered across <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a> known as <a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people">Arbëreshë</a>. They had settled in Italy between the 15th and 16th century, displaced by the changes brought about by the expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. The Arbëreshë were offered refuge by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a> (both under <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Aragonese</a> rule) and given their own villages and protection. The Arbëreshë speak "<a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%20language">Arbërisht</a>", an old variant of Albanian spoken in southern Albania, known as <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosk Albanian</a>. The Arbëreshë are scattered throughout southern Italy and Sicily, and in small numbers also in other parts of Italy. They are in great numbers in North and Latin America, especially in the USA, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Canada. The Arbëreshë constitute one of the largest minorities in Italy. The majority of Albanians in Italy arrived in 1991 and have since surpassed the older populations of Arbëreshë. After the breakdown of the communist regime in Albania in 1990, Italy had been the main immigration target for Albanians leaving their country. This was because Italy had been a symbol of the West for many Albanians during the communist period, because of its geographic proximity.

There are small Albanian populations dating to migrations from the 18th century. One group known as the "<a href="Arbanas">Arbanas</a>" are located on Croatia's Dalmatian coast and fled Ottoman repression. The second known as the "Албанці" (Albantsi) are located in scattered communities across southern Ukraine and descend from Albanian warriors who fought against the Ottoman Empire during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Russo-Turkish%20wars">Russo-Turkish wars</a> and allowed to settle in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. The actual number of the Albanian population in Romania is unofficially estimated at around 10,000 persons. Most members of the community live in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, while the rest mainly live in larger urban centers such as <a href="Timi%C8%99oara">Timișoara</a>, <a href="Ia%C8%99i">Iași</a>, Constanțaand <a href="Cluj-Napoca">Cluj-Napoca</a>. Most families in Romania are Orthodox and trace their origins to the area around <a href="Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB">Korçë</a>.

Approximately 1 million are dispersed throughout the rest of Europe. These are mainly refugees from Kosovo that migrated during the Kosovo war. During the Kosovo war in 1999, many Kosovo Albanians sought asylum in the Federal Republic of Germany. By the end of 1999, the number of Kosovo Albanians in Germany was about 480,000, about 100,000 had returned voluntarily after the war in their homeland or been forcibly removed. The cities with the largest population of Germans of Albanian descent are the metropolitan regions of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>. In Berlin in 1999, there were about 25,000 Albanians; the number dropped because of remigration and Germany's general population decline. In Sweden, Albanians number approximately 54,000. As of 2011 there are approximately 100,000 Albanians living in the United Kingdom.

The Albanian diaspora in Turkey was formed during the Ottoman era through economic migration and early years of the Turkish republic through migration due to sociopolitical discrimination and violence experienced by Albanians in Balkan countries. According to a 2008 report prepared for the <a href="National%20Security%20Council%20%28Turkey%29">National Security Council</a> of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, there were approximately 1,300,000 people of Albanian descent living in Turkey. According to that study, more than 500,000 Albanian descendants still recognize their ancestry and or their language, culture and traditions. There are also other estimates regarding the Albanian population in Turkey that range from being 3–4 million people up to a total of 5 million in number, although most of these are Turkish citizens of either full or partial Albanian ancestry being no longer fluent in Albanian (cf. <a href="German%20Americans">German Americans</a>). This was due to various degrees of either linguistic and or cultural assimilation occurring amongst the Albanian diaspora in Turkey. Nonetheless, a sizable proportion of the Albanian community in Turkey, such as that of <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, has maintained its distinct Albanian identity. Albanians are active in the civic life of Turkey.

In <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> there are 18,000 Albanians, mostly <a href="Tosk">Tosk</a> speakers. Many are descendants of the <a href="Janissaries">Janissaries</a> of <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Pasha">Muhammad Ali Pasha</a>, an Albanian who became <a href="W%C4%81li">Wāli</a>, and self-declared <a href="Khedive">Khedive</a> of Egypt and <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>. In addition to the <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Dynasty">dynasty</a> that he established, a large part of the former Egyptian and Sudanese <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> was of Albanian origin. Albanian Sunnis, Bektashis and Orthodox Christians were all represented in this diaspora, whose members at some point included major <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> figures ("Rilindasit"), including Thimi Mitko, Spiro Dine, Andon Zako Çajupi, Milo Duçi, Fan Noli and others who lived in Egypt for a time. With the ascension of <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> in Egypt and rise of <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalism</a>, the last remnants of Albanian community there were forced to leave. Albanians have been present in <a href="Arab%20world">Arab</a> countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and for about five centuries as a legacy of <a href="Ottoman%20Turk">Ottoman Turk</a>ish rule.

According to the 2010 American Community Survey, there are 193,813 <a href="Albanian%20Americans">Albanian Americans</a> (American citizens of full or partial Albanian descent). In <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> there are a total of 22,000 Albanians. Albanians are also known to reside in China, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore, but the numbers are generally small.

The <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian language</a> occupies an <a href="Language%20isolate">independent</a> branch of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a> tree. It is considered an isolate within the Indo-European tree; no other language has been conclusively linked to its branch. 

A traditional view, based mainly on the territory, where the languages were spoken, links the origin of <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> with <a href="Illyrian%20languages">Illyrian languages</a>. However, not enough Illyrian archaeological evidence is left behind, to come to a definite conclusion. Another theory links the Albanian as originating from the <a href="Thracian%20language">Thracian language</a>. However this theory takes exception to the territory, since the language was spoken in an area distinct from Albania, and no significant population movements have been recorded in the period when the shift from one language to the other is supposed to have occurred. Today, it is the official language of <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and is spoken fluently by the majority of the countries populations. Albanian is a recognised minority language in <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and Serbia. Albanian is the second most spoken language in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> (<a href="Arvanitika">Arvanitika</a> and <a href="Cham%20Albanian%20dialect">Cham</a>), <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a> and the third most spoken language in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Due to the large <a href="Albanian%20diaspora">Albanian diaspora</a>, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe. 

Albanian can be divided into two cultural and linguistic groups such as the northern <a href="Gheg%20Albanian">Ghegs</a> and the southern <a href="Tosk%20Albanian">Tosks</a>. The geographic border between the two groups, based on dialect is the <a href="Shkumbin%20River">Shkumbin River</a>. The Gheg dialect is mostly spoken, along with the <a href="Albanians%20of%20Croatia">Albanians of Croatia</a> (<a href="Arbanasi%20people">Arbanasi</a>), <a href="Kosovo%20Albanians">Kosovo</a>, <a href="Albanians%20in%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, and northwestern <a href="Albanians%20in%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>. However, the Tosks includes the Albanians of <a href="Albanians%20in%20greece">Greece</a> (<a href="Arvanites">Arvanites</a>, <a href="Cham%20Albanians">Çam</a>), southwestern <a href="Albanians%20in%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, and southern Italy (<a href="Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB%20people">Arbëreshë</a>). The diversity between the Ghegs and Tosks can be substantial, both sides identify strongly with the common national and ethnic culture.

The majority of Albanians are nominally <a href="Islam">Muslim</a>s (mainly <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a>, with a smaller <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a>, <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> and <a href="Bektashi">Bektashi</a> component), and a minority are nominally <a href="Christian">Christian</a>s (<a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a>).

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. All Albanians were <a href="Orthodox%20Christians">Orthodox Christians</a> until the middle of the 13th century when the <a href="Ghegs">Ghegs</a> were converted to <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> as a mean to resist the <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a>. <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> was later overtaken by <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, which kept the scepter of the major religion during the period of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> Turkish rule from the 15th century until 1912. <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> continued to be practiced with less frequency.

During the 20th century the monarchy and later the <a href="totalitarian%20state">totalitarian state</a> followed a systematic secularization of the nation and the national culture. This policy was chiefly applied within the borders of the current Albanian state. It produced a secular majority in the population. All forms of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a> and other religious practices were prohibited except for old non-institutional <a href="pagan">pagan</a> practices in the rural areas, which were seen as identifying with the national culture. The current Albanian state has revived some pagan festivals, such as the <a href="Spring%20Day">Spring</a> festival () held yearly on 14 March in the city of <a href="Elbasan">Elbasan</a>. It is a national holiday.
According to 2011 census, 58.79% of Albania adheres to Islam, making it the largest religion in the country. The majority of Albanian Muslims are Secular Sunni with a significant <a href="Bektashi">Bektashi</a> Shia minority. Christianity is practiced by 16.99% of the population, making it the second largest religion in the country. The remaining population is either <a href="irreligious">irreligious</a> or belongs to other religious groups. Before World War II, there was given a distribution of 70% Muslims, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholics. Today, Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays a role in the lives of only 39% of Albanians, and ranks Albania the thirteenth least religious country in the world.
The results of the 2011 census, however, have been criticized as questionable on a number of grounds, and have been said to drastically underrepresent the number of Orthodox, Bektashi and irreligious Albanians, with problems including whole communities reporting that they had not been contacted, workers filling out questions without even asking the respondents and a drastic difference between the final results and the preliminary results with regard to religion (which showed over 70% declining to answer the question about religion).

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first <a href="state%20atheism">atheist state</a>. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> branch) are found throughout the country whereas <a href="Albanian%20Orthodox%20Church">Albanian Orthodox Christians</a> as well as <a href="Bektashi">Bektashi</a>s are concentrated in the south; Roman Catholics are found primarily in the north of the country.

For part of its history, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Albania">Albania has also had a Jewish community</a>. Members of the Jewish community were saved by a group of Albanians during the Nazi occupation. Many left for Israel c. 1990–1992 after borders were open due to fall of communist regime in Albania, while in modern times about 200 Albanian Jews still live in Albania.

A modest amount of literature written by early Albanians was about religious themes. The earliest known use of written Albanian is a <a href="Formula%20e%20pag%C3%ABzimit">baptismal formula</a> (1462) written by the Archbishop of Durrës <a href="Paulus%20Angelus">Paulus Angelus</a>. In 1555, a Catholic clergyman <a href="Gjon%20Buzuku">Gjon Buzuku</a> from the Shestan region published the earliest known book written in Albanian titled "<a href="Meshari">Meshari</a>" (The Missal) regarding Catholic prayers and rites containing archaic medieval language, lexemes and expressions obsolete in contemporary Albanian. Other Christian clergy such as <a href="Luca%20Matranga">Luca Matranga</a> in the Arbëresh diaspora published (1592) in the Tosk dialect while other notable authors were from northern Albanian lands and included <a href="Pjet%C3%ABr%20Budi">Pjetër Budi</a>, <a href="Frang%20Bardhi">Frang Bardhi</a>, and <a href="Pjet%C3%ABr%20Bogdani">Pjetër Bogdani</a>. With the conversion to Islam of many Albanians, Muslim poetic and other literary traditions were adopted giving rise to authors such as the "<a href="Bejtexhinj">Bejtexhinj</a>" (Albanian poets) and included individuals like <a href="Nezim%20Frakulla">Nezim Frakulla</a>, <a href="Hasan%20Zyko%20Kamberi">Hasan Zyko Kamberi</a>, <a href="Muhamet%20Ky%C3%A7yku">Muhamet Kyçyku</a>, and brothers <a href="Shahin%20Frash%C3%ABri">Shahin</a> and <a href="Dalip%20Frash%C3%ABri">Dalip Frashëri</a>. They compiled Albanian literature infused with expressions, language and themes stemming from the Middle East and their local socio-cultural environment. Albanian literature was composed in the Arbëresh diaspora by individuals such as <a href="Giulio%20Variboba">Giulio Variboba</a>, <a href="Nicola%20Chetta">Nicola Chetta</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Schir%C3%B2">Giuseppe Schirò</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Serembe">Giuseppe Serembe</a>, <a href="Girolamo%20de%20Rada">Girolamo de Rada</a> and others relating to religious, secular, poetic and eventually patriotic themes like Skanderbeg. From the 19th century "Rilindja" (Albanian national awakening), a corpus of Albanian literature with patriotic and other themes emerged calling for Albanian unity, self determination and celebrating Albanian culture, language, legends and other figures of sociopoltical, cultural and historic importance. Figures who left their mark during this period were the poet brothers <a href="Naim%20Frash%C3%ABri">Naim</a> and <a href="Sami%20Frash%C3%ABri">Sami Frashëri</a>, <a href="Pashko%20Vasa">Pashko Vasa</a>, <a href="Luigj%20Gurakuqi">Luigj Gurakuqi</a> and others.

Albanian independence (1912) until the advent of the Second World War marked a transition from patriotic and political Rilindja related literature to more distinctive, expressive and matured forms of Albanian literature, prose and poetry focusing upon additional themes of contemporary life. <a href="Andon%20Zako%20%C3%87ajupi">Andon Zako Çajupi</a>, <a href="Ndre%20Mjeda">Ndre Mjeda</a>, <a href="Faik%20Konitza">Faik Konitza</a>, <a href="Fan%20Noli">Fan Noli</a> who translated many foreign works into Albanian, <a href="Gjergj%20Fishta">Gjergj Fishta</a> who composed the epic the "<a href="The%20Highland%20Lute">Highland Lute</a>", <a href="Ernest%20Koliqi">Ernest Koliqi</a>, modernist poets <a href="Migjeni">Migjeni</a> and <a href="Lasgush%20Poradeci">Lasgush Poradeci</a> and others. Albania, post World War Two emerged as a communist state and Socialist realism became part of the literary scene. Authors and poets emerged such as <a href="Sejfulla%20Mal%C3%ABshova">Sejfulla Malëshova</a>, <a href="Dritero%20Agolli">Dritero Agolli</a> and <a href="Ismail%20Kadare">Ismail Kadare</a> who has become an internationally acclaimed novelist and others who challenged the regime through various sociopolitical and historic themes in their works. <a href="Martin%20Camaj">Martin Camaj</a> wrote in the diaspora while in neighbouring Yugoslavia, the emergence of Albanian cultural expression resulted in sociopolitical and poetic literature by notable authors like <a href="Adem%20Dema%C3%A7i">Adem Demaçi</a>, <a href="Rexhep%20Qosja">Rexhep Qosja</a>, <a href="Jusuf%20Buxhovi">Jusuf Buxhovi</a>. The Albanian literary scene at the beginning of the 21st century remains vibrant producing new novelists, authors, poets and other writers.

<a href="Music%20of%20Albania">Albanian folk music</a> displays a variety of influences. Albanian folk music traditions differ by region, with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the <a href="Ghegs">Ghegs</a> in the north and <a href="Tosks">Tosks</a> in the south. Modern popular music has developed around the centers of <a href="Korca">Korca</a>, <a href="Shkod%C3%ABr">Shkodër</a> and <a href="Tirana">Tirana</a>. Since the 1920s, some composers such as <a href="Fan%20S.%20Noli">Fan S. Noli</a> have also produced works of Albanian <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a>.

ACM is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 <a href="Special%20Interest%20Group">Special Interest Group</a>s (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the <a href="University%20of%20Louisiana%20at%20Lafayette">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>.

Many of the SIGs, such as <a href="ACM%20SIGGRAPH">SIGGRAPH</a>, <a href="SIGPLAN">SIGPLAN</a>, <a href="SIGCSE">SIGCSE</a> and <a href="SIGCOMM">SIGCOMM</a>, sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide <a href="ACM%20International%20Collegiate%20Programming%20Contest">ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest</a> (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> and the <a href="IBM%20Deep%20Blue">IBM Deep Blue</a> computer.

ACM publishes over 50 journals including the prestigious "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20ACM">Journal of the ACM</a>", and two general magazines for computer professionals, "<a href="Communications%20of%20the%20ACM">Communications of the ACM</a>" (also known as "Communications" or "CACM") and "<a href="ACM%20Queue">Queue</a>". Other publications of the ACM include:

Although "Communications" no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid <a href="subscriber">subscriber</a>s online at its <a href="%23Digital%20Library">Digital Library</a> and also has a <a href="ACM%20Guide%20to%20Computing%20Literature">Guide to Computing Literature</a>. Individual members additionally have access to <a href="Safari%20Books%20Online">Safari Books Online</a> and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

In 1997, ACM Press published "Wizards and Their Wonders: Portraits in Computing" (), written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by <a href="Louis%20Fabian%20Bachrach%2C%20Jr.">Louis Fabian Bachrach</a>. The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry.

The ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM. 
Its core are two main sections: ACM Digital Library and the <a href="ACM%20Guide%20to%20Computing%20Literature">ACM Guide to Computing Literature</a>.

The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries.
The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.

ACM adopted a hybrid <a href="Open%20access">Open Access</a> (OA) publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement.

ACM was a "green" publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.

All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including <a href="abstracts">abstracts</a>, linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the <a href="Open%20access%20%28publishing%29">open access</a> movement. Some authors see a centralized peer–review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like <a href="arXiv">arXiv</a>. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as <a href="Journal%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Research">Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)</a>, <a href="Journal%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20Research">Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)</a> and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.

In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and "demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers".

The <a href="ACM%20Fellow">ACM Fellow</a>s Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 "to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM." There are presently about 958 Fellows out of about 75,000 professional members.

In 2006 ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and "have made a significant impact on the computing field". Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called "Distinguished Member" and was changed about two years later to "Distinguished Educator". Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.

Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. Senior Members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership.

ACM has three kinds of chapters: <a href="Special%20Interest%20Group">Special Interest Group</a>s, Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters.

As of 2011, ACM has professional & SIG Chapters in 56 countries.

As of 2014, there exist ACM student chapters in 41 different countries.

ACM and its Special Interest Groups (SIGs) sponsors numerous conferences with 170 hosted worldwide in 2017. <a href="http%3A//www.acm.org/conferences">ACM Conferences page</a> has an up-to-date complete list while a partial list is shown below. Most of the SIGs also have an annual conference. ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive. For example, the 2007 <a href="SIGGRAPH">SIGGRAPH</a> conference attracted about 30000 visitors, and CIKM only accepted 15% of the long papers that were submitted in 2005.


The ACM is a co–presenter and founding partner of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) with the <a href="Anita%20Borg%20Institute%20for%20Women%20and%20Technology">Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology</a>.

There are some conferences hosted by ACM student branches; this includes <a href="Reflections%20Projections">Reflections Projections</a>, which is hosted by UIUC ACM. . In addition, ACM sponsors regional conferences. Regional conferences facilitate increased opportunities for collaboration between nearby institutions and they are well attended.

For additional non-ACM conferences, see this <a href="list%20of%20computer%20science%20conferences">list of computer science conferences</a>.

The ACM presents or co–presents a number of awards for outstanding technical and professional achievements and contributions in computer science and information technology. 


Over 30 of ACM's Special Interest Groups also award individuals for their contributions with a few listed below.

The President of ACM for 2016–2018 is <a href="Vicki%20L.%20Hanson">Vicki L. Hanson</a>, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Information Sciences and Technologies at the <a href="Rochester%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> and Professor and Chair of Inclusive Technologies at the <a href="University%20of%20Dundee">University of Dundee</a>, UK. She is successor of <a href="Alexander%20L.%20Wolf">Alexander L. Wolf</a> (2014–2016), Dean of the <a href="Jack%20Baskin%20School%20of%20Engineering">Jack Baskin School of Engineering</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>; <a href="Vint%20Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> (2012–2014), an American computer scientist who is recognized as one of "the fathers of the Internet"; Alain Chesnais (2010–2012), a French citizen living in <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>, Canada, where he runs his company named Visual Transitions; and <a href="Wendy%20Hall">Dame Wendy Hall</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Southampton">University of Southampton</a>, UK (2008–2010).

ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members–At–Large. This institution is often referred to simply as "Council" in "Communications of the ACM".

ACM has five "Boards" that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:

<a href="ACM-W">ACM-W</a>, the ACM council on <a href="women%20in%20computing">women in computing</a>, supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACM–W's main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively. ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the <a href="Anita%20Borg%20Institute">Anita Borg Institute</a>, the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Women%20%26amp%3B%20Information%20Technology">National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)</a>, and .

The ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science. This program began in 2006. Speakers are nominated by SIG officers.

ACM's primary partner has been the <a href="IEEE%20Computer%20Society">IEEE Computer Society</a> (IEEE-CS), which is the largest subgroup of the <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers</a> (IEEE). The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards. ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE. <a href="Eckert-Mauchly%20Award">Eckert-Mauchly Award</a> and <a href="Ken%20Kennedy%20Award">Ken Kennedy Award</a>, both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS. They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.

ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the <a href="Society%20for%20Industrial%20and%20Applied%20Mathematics">Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics</a> (SIAM).

Anabaptism

Anabaptism (from <a href="New%20Latin%20language">Neo-Latin</a> "anabaptista", from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> : "re-" and "baptism") is a <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="Christian%20denomination">movement</a> which traces its origins to the <a href="Radical%20Reformation">Radical Reformation</a> in Europe. The movement is generally seen as an offshoot of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, although this view has been challenged by some Anabaptists.

Anabaptists are <a href="Christians">Christians</a> who believe that <a href="baptism">baptism</a> is valid only when the candidate confesses his or her faith in Christ and wants to be baptized. This <a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a> is opposed to <a href="infant%20baptism">baptism of infants</a>, who are not able to make a conscious decision to be baptized. Anabaptists are those who are in a traditional line with the early Anabaptists of the 16th century. Other Christian groups with different roots also practice believer's baptism, such as <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, but these groups are not seen as Anabaptist. The <a href="Amish">Amish</a>, <a href="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>, and <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a> are direct descendants of the early Anabaptist movement. <a href="Schwarzenau%20Brethren">Schwarzenau Brethren</a>, <a href="Bruderhof">Bruderhof</a>, and the <a href="Apostolic%20Christian%20Church">Apostolic Christian Church</a> are considered later developments among the Anabaptists.

The name Anabaptist means "one who baptizes again". Their persecutors named them this, referring to the practice of baptizing persons when they converted or declared their faith in Christ, even if they had been "baptized" as infants. Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates be able to make a confession of faith that is freely chosen and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that infant baptism was not part of scripture and was therefore null and void. They said that baptizing self-confessed believers was their first true baptism:
Anabaptists were heavily persecuted during the 16th century and into the 17th century by both <a href="Magisterial%20Reformation">Magisterial Protestants</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a>, largely because of their interpretation of scripture which put them at odds with official state church interpretations and with government. Most Anabaptists adhered to a <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount%23Analysis%20and%20interpretation">literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount</a> which precluded taking oaths, participating in military actions, and participating in civil government. Some groups who practiced rebaptism felt otherwise (though they are now extinct) and complied with these requirements of civil society. They were thus technically Anabaptists, even though conservative <a href="Amish">Amish</a>, <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>, <a href="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>, and some historians consider them outside true Anabaptism. <a href="Conrad%20Grebel">Conrad Grebel</a> wrote in a letter to <a href="Thomas%20M%C3%BCntzer">Thomas Müntzer</a> in 1524:

Anabaptists are considered to have begun with the Radical Reformers in the 16th century, but historians classify certain people and groups as their forerunners because of a similar approach to the interpretation and application of the Bible. For instance, <a href="Petr%20Chel%C4%8Dick%C3%BD">Petr Chelčický</a>, a 15th-century <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n reformer, taught most of the beliefs considered integral to Anabaptist theology. Medieval antecedents may include the <a href="Brethren%20of%20the%20Common%20Life">Brethren of the Common Life</a>, the <a href="Hussite">Hussite</a>s, Dutch Sacramentists, and some forms of <a href="monasticism">monasticism</a>. The <a href="Waldensian">Waldensian</a>s also represent a faith similar to the Anabaptists.

Medieval dissenters and Anabaptists who held to a literal interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount share in common the following affirmations:

On December 27, 1521, <a href="Zwickau%20prophets">three "prophets"</a> appeared in <a href="Wittenberg">Wittenberg</a> from <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> who were influenced by (and, in turn, influencing) <a href="Thomas%20M%C3%BCntzer">Thomas Müntzer</a>—Thomas Dreschel, <a href="Nicholas%20Storch">Nicholas Storch</a>, and Mark Thomas Stübner. They preached an apocalyptic, radical alternative to Lutheranism. Their preaching helped to stir the feelings concerning the social crisis which erupted in the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a> in southern <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in 1525 as a revolt against feudal oppression. Under the leadership of Müntzer, it became a war against all constituted authorities and an attempt to establish by revolution an ideal Christian commonwealth, with absolute equality among persons and the community of goods. The Zwickau prophets were not Anabaptists (that is, they did not practise "rebaptism"); nevertheless, the prevalent social inequities and the preaching of men such as these have been seen as laying the foundation for the Anabaptist movement. The social ideals of the Anabaptist movement coincided closely with those of leaders in the German Peasants' War. Studies have found a very low percentage of later Anabaptists to have been active participants in the peasant uprising.

Research on the origins of the Anabaptists has been tainted both by the attempts of their enemies to slander them and by the attempts of their supporters to vindicate them. It was long popular to classify all Anabaptists as Munsterites and radicals associated with the <a href="Zwickau%20prophets">Zwickau prophets</a>, <a href="Jan%20Matthys">Jan Matthys</a>, <a href="John%20of%20Leiden">John of Leiden</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20M%C3%BCntzer">Thomas Müntzer</a>. Those desiring to correct this error tended to over-correct and deny all connections between the larger Anabaptist movement and the most radical elements.

The modern era of Anabaptist historiography arose with Roman Catholic scholar <a href="Carl%20Adolf%20Cornelius">Carl Adolf Cornelius</a>' publication of "Die Geschichte des Münsterischen Aufruhrs" (The History of the Münster Uprising) in 1855. Baptist historian <a href="Albert%20Henry%20Newman">Albert Henry Newman</a> (1852–1933), who <a href="Harold%20S.%20Bender">Harold S. Bender</a> said occupied "first position in the field of American Anabaptist historiography", made a major contribution with his "A History of Anti-Pedobaptism" (1897).

Three main theories on origins of the Anabaptists are the following:

A number of scholars (e.g. Harold S. Bender, William Estep, Robert Friedmann) consider the Anabaptist movement to have developed from the <a href="Swiss%20Brethren">Swiss Brethren</a> movement of <a href="Conrad%20Grebel">Conrad Grebel</a>, <a href="Felix%20Manz">Felix Manz</a>, <a href="George%20Blaurock">George Blaurock</a>, et al. They generally held that Anabaptism had its origins in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, and that the Anabaptism of the Swiss Brethren was transmitted to southern Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, where it developed into its various branches. The monogenesis theory usually rejects the Münsterites and other radicals from the category of true Anabaptists. In the monogenesis view the time of origin is January 21, 1525, when Conrad Grebel baptized George Blaurock, and Blaurock in turn baptized several others immediately. These baptisms were the first "re-baptisms" known in the movement. This continues to be the most widely accepted date posited for the establishment of Anabaptism.

<a href="James%20M.%20Stayer">James M. Stayer</a>, <a href="Werner%20O.%20Packull">Werner O. Packull</a>, and <a href="Klaus%20Deppermann">Klaus Deppermann</a> disputed the idea of a single origin of Anabaptists in a 1975 essay entitled "From Monogenesis to Polygenesis", suggesting that February 24, 1527, at Schleitheim is the proper date of the origin of Anabaptism. On this date the <a href="Swiss%20Brethren">Swiss Brethren</a> wrote a declaration of belief called the <a href="Schleitheim%20Confession">Schleitheim Confession</a>. The authors of the essay noted the agreement among previous Anabaptist historians on polygenesis, even when disputing the date for a single starting point: "Hillerbrand and Bender (like Holl and Troeltsch) were in agreement that there was a single dispersion of Anabaptism ..., which certainly ran through Zurich. The only question was whether or not it went back further to Saxony." After criticizing the standard polygenetic history, the authors found six groups in early Anabaptism which could be collapsed into three originating "points of departure": "South German Anabaptism, the Swiss Brethren, and the Melchiorites." According to their polygenesis theory, South German–Austrian Anabaptism "was a diluted form of <a href="Rhineland%20mysticism">Rhineland mysticism</a>", Swiss Anabaptism "arose out of Reformed <a href="Congregationalist%20polity">congregationalism</a>", and Dutch Anabaptism was formed by "Social unrest and the apocalyptic visions of <a href="Melchior%20Hoffman">Melchior Hoffman</a>". As examples of how the Anabaptist movement was influenced from sources other than the Swiss Brethren movement, mention has been made of how <a href="Pilgram%20Marpeck">Pilgram Marpeck</a>'s "Vermanung" of 1542 was deeply influenced by the "Bekenntnisse" of 1533 by Münster theologian <a href="Bernhard%20Rothmann">Bernhard Rothmann</a>. Melchior Hoffman influenced the Hutterites when they used his commentary on the Apocalypse shortly after he wrote it.

Others who have written in support of polygensis include Grete Mecenseffy and Walter Klaassen, who established links between Thomas Müntzer and Hans Hut. In another work, Gottfried Seebaß and Werner Packull showed the influence of Thomas Müntzer on the formation of South German Anabaptism. Similarly, author Steven Ozment linked <a href="Hans%20Denck">Hans Denck</a> and <a href="Hans%20Hut">Hans Hut</a> with Thomas Müntzer, <a href="Sebastian%20Franck">Sebastian Franck</a>, and others. Author Calvin Pater showed how <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a> influenced Swiss Anabaptism in various areas, including his view of Scripture, doctrine of the church, and views on baptism.

<a href="Baptist%20successionism">Baptist successionists</a> have, at times, pointed to 16th-century Anabaptists as part of an <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a> of churches ("church perpetuity") from the time of Christ. This view is held by some Baptists, some Mennonites, and a number of "true church" movements.

The opponents of the Baptist successionism theory emphasize that these non-Catholic groups clearly differed from each other, that they held some heretical views, or that the groups had no connection with one another and had origins that were separate both in time and in place.

A different strain of successionism is the theory that the Anabaptists are of <a href="Waldensians">Waldensian</a> origin. Some hold the idea that the Waldensians are part of the apostolic succession, while others simply believe they were an independent group out of whom the Anabaptists arose. Ludwig Keller, Thomas M. Lindsay, H. C. Vedder, Delbert Grätz, <a href="John%20T.%20Christian">John T. Christian</a> and <a href="Thieleman%20J.%20van%20Braght">Thieleman J. van Braght</a> (author of <a href="Martyrs%20Mirror">Martyrs Mirror</a>) all held, in varying degrees, the position that the Anabaptists were of Waldensian origin.

Anabaptism in Switzerland began as an offshoot of the church reforms instigated by <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Ulrich Zwingli</a>. As early as 1522 it became evident that Zwingli was on a path of reform preaching when he began to question or criticize such Catholic practices as tithes, the mass, and even infant baptism. Zwingli had gathered a group of reform-minded men around him, with whom he studied classical literature and the scriptures. However, some of these young men began to feel that Zwingli was not moving fast enough in his reform. The division between Zwingli and his more radical disciples became apparent in an October 1523 disputation held in Zurich. When the discussion of the mass was about to be ended without making any actual change in practice, <a href="Conrad%20Grebel">Conrad Grebel</a> stood up and asked "what should be done about the mass?" Zwingli responded by saying the council would make that decision. At this point, Simon Stumpf, a radical priest from Hongg, answered saying, "The decision has already been made by the Spirit of God."

This incident illustrated clearly that Zwingli and his more radical disciples had different expectations. To Zwingli, the reforms would only go as fast as the city Council allowed them. To the radicals, the council had no right to make that decision, but rather the Bible was the final authority of church reform. Feeling frustrated, some of them began to meet on their own for Bible study. As early as 1523, William Reublin began to preach against infant baptism in villages surrounding Zurich, encouraging parents to not baptize their children.

Seeking fellowship with other reform-minded people, the radical group wrote letters to <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20M%C3%BCntzer">Thomas Müntzer</a>. <a href="Felix%20Manz">Felix Manz</a> began to publish some of Karlstadt's writings in Zurich in late 1524. By this time the question of infant baptism had become agitated and the Zurich council had instructed Zwingli to meet weekly with those who rejected infant baptism "until the matter could be resolved". Zwingli broke off the meetings after two sessions, and Felix Manz petitioned the Council to find a solution, since he felt Zwingli was too hard to work with. The council then called a meeting for January 17, 1525.
The Council ruled in this meeting that all who continued to refuse to baptize their infants should be expelled from Zurich if they did not have them baptized within one week. Since Conrad Grebel had refused to baptize his daughter Rachel, born on January 5, 1525, the Council decision was extremely personal to him and others who had not baptized their children. Thus, when sixteen of the radicals met on Saturday evening, January 21, 1525, the situation seemed particularly dark. The Hutterian Chronicle records the event:

After Blaurock was baptized, he in turn baptized others at the meeting. Even though some had rejected infant baptism before this date, these baptisms marked the first re-baptisms of those who had been baptized as infants and thus, technically, Swiss Anabaptism was born on that day.

Anabaptism appears to have come to <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> through the labors of George Blaurock. Similar to the <a href="German%20Peasants%27%20War">German Peasants' War</a>, the Gasmair uprising set the stage by producing a hope for social justice. <a href="Michael%20Gasmair">Michael Gasmair</a> had tried to bring religious, political, and economical reform through a violent peasant uprising, but the movement was squashed. Although little hard evidence exists of a direct connection between Gasmair's uprising and Tyrolian Anabaptism, at least a few of the peasants involved in the uprising later became Anabaptists. While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.

Before Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican. Some of those who participated in conventicles where Protestant ideas were presented later became Anabaptists. As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. George Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area. Another visit through the area in 1529 reinforced these ideas, but he was captured and burned at the stake in <a href="Klausen%2C%20South%20Tyrol">Klausen</a> on September 6, 1529.

<a href="Jacob%20Hutter">Jacob Hutter</a> was one of the early converts in South Tyrol, and later became a leader among the <a href="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>, who received their name from him. Hutter made several trips between Moravia and Tyrol, and most of the Anabaptists in South Tyrol ended up emigrating to Moravia because of the fierce persecution unleashed by <a href="Ferdinand%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Ferdinand I</a>. In November 1535, Hutter was captured near Klausen and taken to Innsbruck where he was burned at the stake on February 25, 1536. By 1540 Anabaptism in South Tyrol was beginning to die out, largely because of the emigration to Moravia of the converts because of incessant persecution.

<a href="Melchior%20Hoffman">Melchior Hoffman</a> is credited with the introduction of Anabaptist ideas into the Low Countries. Hoffman had picked up Lutheran and Reformed ideas, but on April 23, 1530 he was "re-baptized" at <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> and within two months had gone to <a href="Emden">Emden</a> and baptized about 300 persons. For several years Hoffman preached in the Low Countries until he was arrested and imprisoned at Strasbourg, where he died about 10 years later. Hoffman's apocalyptic ideas were indirectly related to the <a href="M%C3%BCnster%20Rebellion">Münster Rebellion</a>, even though he was "of a different spirit". <a href="Obbe%20Philips">Obbe</a> and <a href="Dirk%20Philips">Dirk Philips</a> had been baptized by disciples of <a href="Jan%20Matthijs">Jan Matthijs</a>, but were opposed to the violence that occurred at Münster. Obbe later became disillusioned with Anabaptism and withdrew from the movement in about 1540, but not before ordaining <a href="David%20Joris">David Joris</a>, his brother <a href="Dirk%20Philips">Dirk</a>, and <a href="Menno%20Simons">Menno Simons</a>, the latter from whom the <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s received their name. David Joris and Menno Simons parted ways, with Joris placing more emphasis on "spirit and prophecy", while Menno emphasized the authority of the Bible. For the Mennonite side, the emphasis on the "inner" and "spiritual" permitted compromise to "escape persecution", while to the Joris side, the Mennonites were under the "dead letter of the Scripture". Because of persecution and expansion, many of the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Country</a> Mennonites emigrated to <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and from there to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (which at the time was part of <a href="Russia">Russia</a>). In the late 1800s, many of the <a href="History%20of%20Germans%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Russian</a> <a href="Volga%20Germans">Mennonites</a> emigrated to the prairie states and provinces of the U.S. and Canada; to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>; to <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, and to South America (especially <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>) where thousands of them still live in colonies.

Although Moravian Anabaptism was a transplant from other areas of Europe, Moravia soon became a center for the growing movement, largely because of the greater religious tolerance found there. <a href="Hans%20Hut">Hans Hut</a> was an early evangelist in the area, with one historian crediting him with baptizing more converts in two years than all the other Anabaptist evangelists put together. The coming of <a href="Balthasar%20H%C3%BCbmaier">Balthasar Hübmaier</a> to <a href="Nikolsburg">Nikolsburg</a> was a definite boost for Anabaptist ideas to the area. With the great influx of religious refugees from all over Europe, many variations of Anabaptism appeared in Moravia, with Jarold Zeman documenting at least ten slightly different versions. Soon, one-eyed Jacob Wiedemann appeared at Nikolsburg, and began to teach the pacifistic convictions of the <a href="Swiss%20Brethren">Swiss Brethren</a>, on which Hübmaier had been less authoritative. This would lead to a division between the "Schwertler" (sword-bearing) and the "Stäbler" (staff-bearing). Wiedemann and those with him also promoted the practice of <a href="community%20of%20goods">community of goods</a>. With orders from the lords of <a href="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> to leave Nikolsburg, about 200 "Stäbler" withdrew to Moravia to form a community at Austerlitz.

Persecution in <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a> brought many refugees to Moravia, many of whom formed into communities that practised community of goods. <a href="Jacob%20Hutter">Jacob Hutter</a> was instrumental in organizing these into what became known as the <a href="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>. But others came from <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, German lands, and the Low Countries. With the passing of time and persecution, all the other versions of Anabaptism would die out in Moravia, leaving only the Hutterites. Even the Hutterites would be dissipated by persecution, with a remnant fleeing to <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, then to the Ukraine, and finally to North America in 1874.

South German Anabaptism had its roots in <a href="German%20mysticism">German mysticism</a>. <a href="Andreas%20Karlstadt">Andreas Karlstadt</a>, who first worked alongside <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, is seen as a forerunner of South German Anabaptism because of his reforming theology that rejected many Catholic practices, including infant baptism. However, Karlstadt is not known to have been "rebaptized", nor to have taught it. <a href="Hans%20Denck">Hans Denck</a> and <a href="Hans%20Hut">Hans Hut</a>, both with German Mystical background (in connection with <a href="Thomas%20Muntzer">Thomas Muntzer</a>) both accepted "rebaptism", but Denck eventually backed off from the idea under pressure. Hans Hut is said to have brought more people into early Anabaptism than all the other Anabaptist evangelists of his time put together. However, there may have been confusion about what his baptism (at least some of the times it was done by making the sign of the <a href="Tau%23Symbolism">Tau</a> on the forehead) may have meant to the recipient. Some seem to have taken it as a sign by which they would escape the apocalyptical revenge of the Turks that Hut predicted. Hut even went so far as to predict a 1528 coming of the kingdom of God. When the prediction failed, some of his converts became discouraged and left the Anabaptist movement. The large congregation of Anabaptists at Augsburg fell apart (partly because of persecution) and those who stayed with Anabaptist ideas were absorbed into Swiss and Moravia Anabaptist congregations. <a href="Pilgram%20Marpeck">Pilgram Marpeck</a> was another notable leader in early South German Anabaptism.

Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement. The Protestants under <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Zwingli</a> were the first to persecute the Anabaptists, with <a href="Felix%20Manz">Felix Manz</a> becoming the first martyr in 1527. On May 20 or 21st, 1527, Roman Catholic authorities executed <a href="Michael%20Sattler">Michael Sattler</a>. King Ferdinand declared drowning (called the "third baptism") "the best antidote to Anabaptism". The Tudor regime, even the Protestant monarchs (<a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI of England</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>), persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability. The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> and <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> that were passed against the <a href="Donatists">Donatists</a>, which decreed the death penalty for any who practised rebaptism. "<a href="Martyrs%20Mirror">Martyrs Mirror</a>", by <a href="Thieleman%20J.%20van%20Braght">Thieleman J. van Braght</a>, describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists in various parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> was largely responsible for the mass emigrations to North America by <a href="Amish">Amish</a>, <a href="Hutterites">Hutterites</a>, and <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>.

Unlike <a href="Calvinists">Calvinists</a>, Anabaptists failed to get a recognition in the <a href="Peace%20of%20Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia</a> of 1648 and persecution continued in Europe well after that treaty.

Different types exist among the Anabaptists, although the categorizations tend to vary with the scholar's viewpoint on origins. Estep claims that in order to understand Anabaptism, one must "distinguish between the Anabaptists, inspirationists, and rationalists". He classes the likes of Blaurock, Grebel, <a href="Balthasar%20Hubmaier">Balthasar Hubmaier</a>, Manz, Marpeck, and Simons as Anabaptists. He groups Müntzer, Storch, et al. as inspirationists, and anti-trinitarians such as <a href="Michael%20Servetus">Michael Servetus</a>, <a href="Juan%20de%20Valdes">Juan de Valdés</a>, <a href="Sebastian%20Castellio">Sebastian Castellio</a>, and <a href="Faustus%20Socinus">Faustus Socinus</a> as <a href="rationalism">rationalists</a>. Mark S. Ritchie follows this line of thought, saying, "The Anabaptists were one of several branches of 'Radical' reformers (i.e. reformers that went further than the mainstream Reformers) to arise out of the Renaissance and <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. Two other branches were Spirituals or Inspirationists, who believed that they had received direct revelation from the Spirit, and rationalists or anti-Trinitarians, who rebelled against traditional Christian doctrine, like Michael Servetus."

Those of the polygenesis viewpoint use "Anabaptist" to define the larger movement, and include the inspirationists and rationalists as true Anabaptists. James M. Stayer used the term "Anabaptist" for those who "rebaptized" persons already "baptized" in infancy. Walter Klaassen was perhaps the first Mennonite scholar to define "Anabaptists" that way in his 1960 Oxford dissertation. This represents a rejection of the previous standard held by Mennonite scholars such as Bender and Friedmann.

Another method of categorization acknowledges regional variations, such as Swiss Brethren (Grebel, Manz), Dutch and <a href="Frisia">Frisia</a>n Anabaptism (Menno Simons, <a href="Dirk%20Philips">Dirk Philips</a>), and South German Anabaptism (Hübmaier, Marpeck).

Historians and sociologists have made further distinctions between radical Anabaptists, who were prepared to use violence in their attempts to build a <a href="New%20Jerusalem">New Jerusalem</a>, and their pacifist brethren, later broadly known as <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>. Radical Anabaptist groups included the Münsterites, who occupied and held the German city of <a href="M%C3%BCnster">Münster</a> in 1534–1535, and the <a href="Batenburgers">Batenburgers</a>, who persisted in various guises as late as the 1570s.

Within the inspirationist wing of the Anabaptist movement, it was not unusual for <a href="Charismatic%20Christianity">charismatic</a> manifestations to appear, such as dancing, falling under the power of the Holy Spirit, "prophetic processions" (at Zurich in 1525, at Munster in 1534 and at Amsterdam in 1535), and speaking in tongues. In Germany some Anabaptists, "excited by mass hypnosis, experienced healings, glossolalia, contortions and other manifestations of a camp-meeting revival". The Anabaptist congregations that later developed into the Mennonite and Hutterite churches tended not to promote these manifestations, but did not totally reject the miraculous. <a href="Pilgram%20Marpeck">Pilgram Marpeck</a>, for example, wrote against the exclusion of miracles: "Nor does Scripture assert this exclusion ... God has a free hand even in these last days." Referring to some who had been raised from the dead, he wrote: "Many of them have remained constant, enduring tortures inflicted by sword, rope, fire and water and suffering terrible, tyrannical, unheard-of deaths and martyrdoms, all of which they could easily have avoided by recantation. Moreover one also marvels when he sees how the faithful God (Who, after all, overflows with goodness) raises from the dead several such brothers and sisters of Christ after they were hanged, drowned, or killed in other ways. Even today, they are found alive and we can hear their own testimony ... Cannot everyone who sees, even the blind, say with a good conscience that such things are a powerful, unusual, and miraculous act of God? Those who would deny it must be hardened men." The <a href="Hutterite">Hutterite</a> Chronicle and The <a href="Martyrs%20Mirror">Martyrs Mirror</a> record several accounts of miraculous events, such as when a man named Martin prophesied while being led across a bridge to his execution in 1531: "this once yet the pious are led over this bridge, but no more hereafter". Just "a short time afterwards such a violent storm and flood came that the bridge was demolished".

The Anabaptists insisted upon the "free course" of the Holy Spirit in worship, yet still maintained it all must be judged according to the Scriptures. The Swiss Anabaptist document titled "Answer of Some Who Are Called (Ana-)Baptists – Why They Do Not Attend the Churches". One reason given for not attending the state churches was that these institutions forbade the congregation to exercise spiritual gifts according to "the Christian order as taught in the gospel or the Word of God in 1 Corinthians 14". "When such believers come together, 'Everyone of you (note every one) hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation', and so on. When someone comes to church and constantly hears only one person speaking, and all the listeners are silent, neither speaking nor prophesying, who can or will regard or confess the same to be a spiritual congregation, or confess according to 1 Corinthians 14 that God is dwelling and operating in them through His Holy Spirit with His gifts, impelling them one after another in the above-mentioned order of speaking and prophesying."

Several existing denominational bodies are the direct successors of the continental Anabaptists. <a href="Mennonite">Mennonite</a>s, <a href="Amish">Amish</a> and <a href="Hutterite">Hutterite</a>s are in a direct and unbroken line back to the Anabapists of the early 16th century. <a href="Schwarzenau%20Brethren">Schwarzenau Brethren</a> and <a href="River%20Brethren">River Brethren</a> emerged in the 18th century and adopted many Anabapist elements. The same is true for the <a href="Bruderhof%20Communities">Bruderhof Communities</a> that emerged in the early 20th century. Sometimes the <a href="Apostolic%20Christian%20Church">Apostolic Christian Church</a> is seen as "Neutäufer" ("Neo-Anabaptist"). Some historical connections have been demonstrated for all of these spiritual descendants, though perhaps not as clearly as the noted institutionally lineal descendants.

Although many see the more well-known Anabaptist groups (Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites) as ethnic groups, only the Amish and the Hutterites today are composed almost totally of descendants of the continental Anabaptists, while among the Mennonites there are <a href="Ethnic%20Mennonite">Ethnic Mennonite</a>s and others who are not. Brethren groups have mostly lost their ethnic distinctiveness.

Total worldwide membership of the Mennonite, <a href="Brethren%20in%20Christ">Brethren in Christ</a> and related churches totals 1,616,126 (as of 2009) with about 60 percent in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In 2015 there were some 300,000 Amish, more than 200,000 <a href="Russian%20Mennonites">"Russian" Mennonites</a> in Latin America, some 60,000 to 80,000 <a href="Old%20Order%20Mennonites">Old Order Mennonites</a> and some 50,000 <a href="Hutterite">Hutterite</a>s, who have preserved their ethnicity, their German dialects (<a href="Pennsylvania%20German%20language">Pennsylvania German</a>, <a href="Plautdietsch">Plautdietsch</a>, <a href="Hutterisch">Hutterisch</a>), <a href="Plain%20dress">Plain dress</a> and many other old traditions.

The <a href="Bruderhof%20Communities">Bruderhof Communities</a> were founded in Germany by <a href="Eberhard%20Arnold">Eberhard Arnold</a> in 1920, establishing and organisationally joining the Hutterites in 1930. The group moved to England after the <a href="Nazi%20Dissolution%20of%20the%20Bruderhof">Gestapo confiscated their property</a> in 1933, and subsequently to Paraguay to avoid military conscription, and by settlement then moved the United States after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Groups deriving from the <a href="Schwarzenau%20Brethren">Schwarzenau Brethren</a>, often called <a href="German%20Baptist">German Baptist</a>s, while not directly descended from the 16th-century Anabaptists, are usually considered Anabaptist because of an almost identical doctrine and practice. The modern-day Brethren movement is a combination of Anabaptism and <a href="Radical%20Pietism">Radical Pietism</a>.

The relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the then five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>s of England and their <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> branch arose independently, and although they may have been informed by Anabaptist theology, they clearly differentiate themselves from Anabaptists as seen in the London Baptist Confession of Faith A.D. 1644, "Of those Churches which are commonly (though falsely) called ANABAPTISTS". Moreover, Baptist historian Chris Traffanstedt maintains that Anabaptists share "some similarities with the early General Baptists, but overall these similarities are slight and not always relational. In the end, we must come to say that this group of Christians does not reflect the historical teaching of the Baptists". German Baptists are not related to the English Baptist movement and were inspired by central European Anabaptists. Upon moving to the United States, they associated with Mennonites and Quakers.

Anabaptist characters exist in popular culture, most notably <a href="Chaplain%20Tappman">Chaplain Tappman</a> in <a href="Joseph%20Heller">Joseph Heller</a>'s novel "<a href="Catch-22">Catch-22</a>", James (Jacques) in <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s novella "<a href="Candide">Candide</a>", <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>'s opera "<a href="Le%20proph%C3%A8te">Le prophète</a>" (1849), and the central character in the novel "<a href="Q%20%28novel%29">Q</a>", by the collective known as "Luther Blissett".

The term "Neo-Anabaptist" has been used to describe a late twentieth and early twenty-first century theological movement within American <a href="evangelical%20Christianity">evangelical Christianity</a> which draws inspiration from theologians located within the Anabaptist tradition while remaining ecclesiastically outside of it. Neo-Anabaptists have been noted for its "low church, counter-cultural, prophetic-stance-against-empire ethos" and for focusing on <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a>, <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and <a href="poverty">poverty</a>. The works of Mennonite theologians <a href="Ron%20Sider">Ron Sider</a> and <a href="John%20Howard%20Yoder">John Howard Yoder</a> are frequently cited as having a strong influence on the movement.

Persons often associated with the Neo-Anabaptist movement include <a href="Stanley%20Hauerwas">Stanley Hauerwas</a>, <a href="Scot%20McKnight">Scot McKnight</a>, <a href="Rob%20Bell">Rob Bell</a>, <a href="Brian%20McLaren">Brian McLaren</a>, <a href="Jim%20Wallis">Jim Wallis</a>, and <a href="Shane%20Claiborne">Shane Claiborne</a>.

Common Anabaptist beliefs and practices of the 16th century continue to influence modern Christianity and Western society.

The Anabaptists were early promoters of a free church and freedom of religion (sometimes associated with separation of church and state). When it was introduced by the Anabaptists in the 15th and 16th centuries, religious freedom independent of the state was unthinkable to both clerical and governmental leaders. Religious liberty was equated with anarchy; Kropotkin traces the birth of anarchist thought in Europe to these early Anabaptist communities.

Southeast Alaska is the northern terminus of the <a href="Inside%20Passage">Inside Passage</a>, a protected waterway of convoluted passages between islands and fjords, beginning in <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> state. This was an important travel corridor for <a href="Tlingit%20people">Tlingit</a> and <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a> Native peoples, as well as gold-rush era steamships. In modern times it is an important route for <a href="Alaska%20Marine%20Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a> ferries as well as <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a>s. 
Southeast Alaska has a land area of comprising seven entire <a href="county-equivalent">borough</a>s and two <a href="census%20area">census area</a>s, in addition to the portion of the <a href="Yakutat%20City%20and%20Borough%2C%20Alaska">Yakutat Borough</a> lying east of <a href="141st%20meridian%20west">141° West</a> longitude.

There are also many towns and villages with around 100 people, such as <a href="Baranof%20Warm%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Baranof Warm Springs</a>, <a href="Edna%20Bay%2C%20Alaska">Edna Bay</a>, <a href="Elfin%20Cove%2C%20Alaska">Elfin Cove</a>, <a href="Excursion%20Inlet%2C%20Alaska">Excursion Inlet</a>, <a href="Funter%20Bay%2C%20Alaska">Funter Bay</a>, <a href="Meyers%20Chuck%2C%20Alaska">Meyers Chuck</a>, <a href="Pelican%2C%20Alaska">Pelican</a>, <a href="Port%20Alexander%2C%20Alaska">Port Alexander</a>, <a href="Port%20Frederick%2C%20Alaska">Port Frederick</a>, <a href="Port%20Protection%2C%20Alaska">Port Protection</a>, and <a href="Tenakee%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Tenakee Springs</a>. This region is also home to the easternmost town in Alaska, <a href="Hyder%2C%20Alaska">Hyder</a>.

This area is the traditional homeland of the <a href="Tlingit%20people">Tlingit</a>, and home of a historic settling of <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a> as well as a modern settlement of <a href="Tsimshian">Tsimshian</a>. The region is closely connected to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> and the American <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> economically and culturally.

In modern times, southeastern Alaskans can often be identified by their fashion choices, notably
<a href="Xtratuf">Xtratuf</a> boots, and "shirtjacs" (a garment having aspects of both <a href="shirt">shirt</a> and <a href="jacket">jacket</a>).
Major industries in Southeast Alaska include <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial fishing</a> and <a href="tourism">tourism</a> (primarily the cruise ship industry). 

<a href="Logging">Logging</a> has been an important industry in the past, but has been steadily declining with competition from other areas and the closure of the region's major pulp mills; the Alaska Forest Association described the situation as "desperate" in 2011. Its members include Alcan Forest Products (owned by Canadian Transpac Group, one of the top 5 log exporters in North America) and Viking Lumber, which had been founded in Maine. Debates over whether to expand logging in the federally owned Tongass are not uncommon.

Mining remains important in the northern area with the <a href="Juneau%20mining%20district">Juneau mining district</a> and <a href="Admiralty%20mining%20district">Admiralty mining district</a> hosting active mines as of 2015. Gold was discovered in 1880 and played an important part in the early history of the region.

In the 2010s, mines increasingly begun to be explored and eventually completed in neighboring <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, upstream of important rivers such as the <a href="Unuk%20River">Unuk</a> and the <a href="Stikine%20River">Stikine</a>, which became known as the transboundary mining issue. In 2014, the <a href="Mount%20Polley%20mine%20disaster">Mount Polley Mine disaster</a> focused attention on the issue, and an agreement between Canada and Alaska was drafted in 2015.

The proposed <a href="Kerr%20Sulphurets%20Mitchell">Kerr Sulphurets Mitchell</a> exploration is upstream of the Unuk. Mines upstream of the Stikine include the Red Chris, which is owned by the same company (Imperial Metals) as the Mount Polley mine.

The border between the Canadian province of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> and Alaska is known as the <a href="Alaska%20boundary%20dispute">Alaska boundary dispute</a>, where the United States, Canada and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and British Columbia claimed different borderlines at the Alaskan Panhandle. While the British foreign affairs were in favor of support of the Canadian argument, the event resulted in what was thought of as a betrayal, leading to <a href="Alaska_boundary_dispute%23Canadian_controversy">alienation of the British</a> from the new nation of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>.

Historian <a href="Patricia%20Roppel">Patricia Roppel</a> authored thirteen books and more than 100 articles, many of which regarded the region.

Due to the extremely rugged, mountainous nature of Southeastern Alaska, almost all communities (with the exception of <a href="Hyder%2C%20Alaska">Hyder</a>, <a href="Skagway">Skagway</a>, and <a href="Haines%2C%20Alaska">Haines</a>) have no road connections outside of their locale, so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport. The <a href="Alaska%20Marine%20Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a> passes through this region.

<a href="Alaska%20Airlines">Alaska Airlines</a> is by far the largest air carrier in the region, with Juneau's <a href="Juneau%20International%20Airport">Juneau International Airport</a> serving as the aerial hub for all of Southeast and Ketchikan's <a href="Ketchikan%20International%20Airport">Ketchikan International Airport</a> serving as a secondary hub for southern Southeast Alaska. Alaska's <a href="Bush%20aviation">bush airlines</a> and <a href="air%20taxi">air taxi</a>s serve many of the smaller and more isolated communities and villages in the regions. Many communities are accessible by air only by <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>, as proper runways are often difficult to construct on the steep island slopes.

Southeast Alaska is primarily served by the state-run <a href="Alaska%20Marine%20Highway">Alaska Marine Highway</a>, which links Skagway, Haines, <a href="Hoonah%2C%20Alaska">Hoonah</a>, <a href="Juneau">Juneau</a>, <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>, <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Alaska">Petersburg</a>, <a href="Wrangell%2C%20Alaska">Wrangell</a>, <a href="Ketchikan%2C%20Alaska">Ketchikan</a> and other outlying communities with <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20BC">Prince Rupert, BC</a> and <a href="Bellingham%2C%20Washington">Bellingham, Washington</a>; and secondarily by the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Island%20%28Alaska%29">Prince of Wales Island</a>-based <a href="Inter-Island%20Ferry%20Authority">Inter-Island Ferry Authority</a>, which provides the only scheduled passenger and auto ferry service to the island. A new Authority, the Rainforest Islands Ferry Authority, was created and in 2014 may possibly operate the North End route. The Authority would connect Coffman Cove with Wrangell and Petersburg. Small companies like Sitka-based Allen Marine and other independent operators in the <a href="Lynn%20Canal">Lynn Canal</a> occasionally also offer marine passenger service. Ship traffic in the area is seasonally busy with <a href="cruise%20ship">cruise ship</a>s.

Interior Alaska

Interior Alaska is the central region of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>'s territory, roughly bounded by the <a href="Alaska%20Range">Alaska Range</a> to the south and the <a href="Brooks%20Range">Brooks Range</a> to the north. It is largely <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a>. Mountains include <a href="Denali">Denali</a> in the <a href="Alaska%20Range">Alaska Range</a>, the <a href="Wrangell%20Mountains">Wrangell Mountains</a>, and the <a href="Ray%20Mountains">Ray Mountains</a>. The <a href="Alaska%20Natives">native people</a> of the interior are <a href="Alaskan%20Athabaskans">Alaskan Athabaskans</a>. The largest city in the interior is <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>'s second-largest city, in the <a href="Tanana%20Valley">Tanana Valley</a>. Other towns include <a href="North%20Pole%2C%20Alaska">North Pole</a>, just southeast of Fairbanks, <a href="Eagle%2C%20Alaska">Eagle</a>, <a href="Tok%2C%20Alaska">Tok</a>, <a href="Glennallen%2C%20Alaska">Glennallen</a>, <a href="Delta%20Junction%2C%20Alaska">Delta Junction</a>, <a href="Nenana%2C%20Alaska">Nenana</a>, <a href="Anderson%2C%20Alaska">Anderson</a>, <a href="Healy%2C%20Alaska">Healy</a> and <a href="Cantwell%2C%20Alaska">Cantwell</a>.

Interior Alaska experiences extreme seasonal temperature variability. Winter temperatures in Fairbanks average −12 °<a href="Fahrenheit">F</a> (−24 °<a href="Celsius">C</a>) and summer temperatures average +62 °F (+17 °C). Temperatures there have been recorded as low as −65 °F (−54 °C) in mid-winter, and as high as +99 °F (+37 °C) in summer. Both the highest and lowest temperature records for the state were set in the Interior, with 100 °F (38 °C) in <a href="Fort%20Yukon%2C%20Alaska">Fort Yukon</a> and −80 °F (−64 °C) in <a href="Prospect%20Creek%2C%20Alaska">Prospect Creek</a>. Temperatures within a given winter are highly variable as well; extended cold snaps of forty below zero can be followed by unseasonable warmth with temperatures above freezing due to <a href="chinook%20wind">chinook wind</a> effects.

Summers can be warm and dry for extended periods creating ideal fire weather conditions. Weak thunderstorms produce mostly dry lightning, sparking wildfires that are mostly left to burn themselves out as they are often far from populated areas. The <a href="2004%20Alaska%20fire%20season">2004 season</a> set a new record with over burned.

The average annual precipitation in Fairbanks is 11.3 inches (28.7 cm). Most of this comes in the form of snow during the winter. Most storms in the interior of Alaska originate in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Alaska">Gulf of Alaska</a>, south of the state, though these storms often have limited precipitation due to a <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> effect caused by the <a href="Alaska%20Range">Alaska Range</a>.

On clear winter nights, the <a href="aurora%20borealis">aurora borealis</a> can often be seen dancing in the sky. Like all subarctic regions, the months from May to July in the summer have no night, only a twilight during the night hours. The months of November to January have little daylight. Fairbanks receives an average 21 hours of daylight between May 10 and August 2 each summer, and an average of less than four hours of daylight between November 18 and January 24 each winter.

The interior of Alaska is largely underlined by discontinuous <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a>, which grades to continuous permafrost as the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a> is approached.

While the vast majority of indigenous <a href="Alaska%20Natives">Native</a> people of Interior Alaska are <a href="Alaskan%20Athabaskans">Athabaskan Indians</a>, a significant Eskimo (<a href="Yup%27ik">Yup'ik</a> and <a href="I%C3%B1upiaq">Iñupiaq</a>) population resides in <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks</a>.
