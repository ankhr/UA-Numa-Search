Apatosaurus

Apatosaurus (; meaning "deceptive lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of extinct <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s that lived in <a href="Laurentia">North America</a> during the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a>. <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> described and named the first-known species, A. ajax, in 1877, and a second species, A. louisae, was discovered and named by William H. Holland in 1916. "Apatosaurus" lived about 152 to 151 million years ago (mya), during the early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> age, and are now known from <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s in the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> of modern-day <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in the United States. "Apatosaurus" had an average length of , and an average mass of . A few specimens indicate a maximum length of 11–30% greater than average and a mass of .

The <a href="cervical%20vertebrae">cervical vertebrae</a> of "Apatosaurus" are less elongated and more heavily constructed than those of "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", a <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a> like "Apatosaurus", and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that "Apatosaurus" was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. "Apatosaurus" had a single <a href="claw">claw</a> on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The "Apatosaurus" skull, long thought to be similar to "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>", is much more similar to that of "Diplodocus". "Apatosaurus" was a generalized <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a> that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, "Apatosaurus" had <a href="air%20sacs">air sacs</a> that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.

The skull of "Apatosaurus" was confused with that of "Camarasaurus" and "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>" until 1909, when the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "A. louisae" was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away from the front of the neck. <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> disagreed with this association, and went on to mount a skeleton of "Apatosaurus" with a "Camarasaurus" skull cast. Until 1970, "Apatosaurus" skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to "Diplodocus" were more likely from "Apatosaurus".

"Apatosaurus" is a genus in the family Diplodocidae. It is one of the more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> genera, with only "<a href="Amphicoelias">Amphicoelias</a>" and possibly a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a> was named in 1929, the group was not used <a href="valid%20name%20%28zoology%29">validly</a> until an extensive 2015 study. Only "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>" is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as <a href="diplodocinae">diplodocines</a>. "Brontosaurus" has long been considered a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Apatosaurus"; its only species was reclassified as "A.excelsus" in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that "Brontosaurus" is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from "Apatosaurus", but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North America during the late Jurassic, "Apatosaurus" would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>".

"Apatosaurus" was a large, long-necked, <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al animal with a long, whip-like tail. Its <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s were slightly shorter than its <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a>s. Most size estimates are based on specimen <a href="Carnegie%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">CM</a>3018, the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> of "A.louisae". In 1936 this was measured to be , by measuring the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>. Current estimates are similar, finding that the individual was long and had a mass of . A 2015 study that estimated the mass of volumetric models of "<a href="Dreadnoughtus">Dreadnoughtus</a>", "Apatosaurus", and "<a href="Giraffatitan">Giraffatitan</a>" estimates CM3018 at , similar in mass to "Dreadnoughtus". Past estimates have put the creature's mass as high as . Some specimens of "A.ajax" (such as <a href="Oklahoma%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">OMNH</a>1670) represent individuals 1130% longer, suggesting masses twice that of CM3018 or , potentially rivalling the largest <a href="titanosaur">titanosaur</a>s.
The skull is small in relation to the size of the animal. The jaws are lined with spatulate (chisel-like) teeth suited to an <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> diet. The snout of "Apatosaurus" and similar <a href="diplodocoidea">diplodocoids</a> is squared, with only "<a href="Nigersaurus">Nigersaurus</a>" having a squarer skull. The braincase of "Apatosaurus" is well preserved in specimen BYU17096, which also preserved much of the skeleton. A phylogenetic analysis found that the braincase had a morphology similar to those of other diplodocoids. Some skulls of "Apatosaurus" have been found still in articulation with their teeth. Those teeth that have the <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> surface exposed do not show any scratches on the surface; instead, they display a sugary texture and little wear.

Like those of other sauropods, the neck vertebrae are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of "A.louisae" is 15cervicals, 10<a href="thoracic%20vertebrae">dorsals</a>, 5<a href="Sacrum%23Other%20animals">sacrals</a>, and 82<a href="Vertebra%23Other%20animals">caudals</a>. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" are stouter and more robust than those of other <a href="diplodocid">diplodocid</a>s and were found to be most similar to "Camarasaurus" by <a href="Charles%20Whitney%20Gilmore">Charles Whitney Gilmore</a>. In addition, they support <a href="Cervical%20rib%23Other%20animals">cervical ribs</a> that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In "Apatosaurus louisae", the <a href="atlas%20%28anatomy%29">atlas</a>-<a href="axis%20%28anatomy%29">axis</a> complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. "Apatosaurus" has ten dorsal ribs on either side of the body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. "Apatosaurus", like its close relative "<a href="Supersaurus">Supersaurus</a>", has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. "Apatosaurus" also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.
The limb bones are also very robust. Within <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a>, the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> of "Apatosaurus louisae" is intermediate in morphology between those of "A.ajax" and "Brontosaurus excelsus". The arm bones are stout, so the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> of "Apatosaurus" resembles that of "Camarasaurus", as well as "Brontosaurus". However, the humeri of "Brontosaurus" and "A.ajax" are more similar to each other than they are to "A.louisae". In 1936 <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a> noted that previous reconstructions of "Apatosaurus" forelimbs erroneously proposed that the <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> could cross; in life they would have remained parallel. "Apatosaurus" had a single large claw on each forelimb, a feature shared by all sauropods more derived than "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>". The first three toes had claws on each hindlimb. The phalangeal formula is 2-1-1-1-1, meaning the innermost finger (phalanx) on the forelimb has two bones and the next has one. The single manual claw bone (<a href="ungual">ungual</a>) is slightly curved and squarely <a href="%3Awikt%3Atruncated">truncated</a> on the anterior end. The pelvic girdle includes the robust <a href="ilium%20bone">ilia</a>, and the fused (co-ossified) <a href="pubic%20bone">pubes</a> and <a href="ischium">ischia</a>. The femora of "Apatosaurus" are very stout and represent some of the most robust femora of any member of Sauropoda. The tibia and fibula bones are different from the slender bones of "Diplodocus" but are nearly indistinguishable from those of "Camarasaurus". The fibula is longer and slenderer than the tibia. The foot of "Apatosaurus" has three claws on the innermost digits; the digit formula is 3-4-5-3-2. The first metatarsal is the stoutest, a feature shared among diplodocids.

The name "Apatosaurus ajax" was coined in 1877 by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, Professor of <a href="Paleontology">Paleontology</a> at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, based on a nearly complete skeleton (holotype, <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">YPM</a>1860) discovered in the eastern foothills of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in <a href="Gunnison%20County%2C%20Colorado">Gunnison County, Colorado</a>. The composite term "Apatosaurus" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words "apatē" ()/"apatēlos" () meaning "deception"/"deceptive", and "sauros" () meaning "lizard"; thus, "deceptive lizard". Marsh gave it this name based on the <a href="chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevron</a> bones, which are dissimilar to those of other dinosaurs; instead, the chevron bones of "Apatosaurus" showed similarities with those of <a href="mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s. During excavation and transportation, the bones of the holotype skeleton were mixed with those of another "Apatosaurus" individual originally described as "Atlantosaurus immanis"; as a consequence, some elements cannot be ascribed to either specimen with confidence. Marsh distinguished the new genus "Apatosaurus" from "<a href="Atlantosaurus">Atlantosaurus</a>" on the basis of the number of sacral vertebrae, with "Apatosaurus" possessing three and "Atlantosaurus" four. Two years later, Marsh announced the discovery of a larger and more complete specimen at <a href="Como%20Bluff">Como Bluff</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. He gave this specimen a new name based on the conventions of his age and the relatively sparse fossil record available at that time. It was later recognised that the features he had used to distinguish genera and species were in fact more widespread among sauropods. He named the new species "Brontosaurus excelsus". All specimens currently considered "Apatosaurus" were from the Morrison Formation, the location of the excavations of Marsh and his rival <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>.
Another specimen, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, which is occasionally assigned to "Apatosaurus", is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and sections of the tail are missing, and it was the first sauropod skeleton mounted. The specimen was found north of <a href="Medicine%20Bow%2C%20Wyoming">Medicine Bow, Wyoming</a>, in 1898 by <a href="Walter%20W.%20Granger">Walter Granger</a>, and took the entire summer to extract. To complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of "Diplodocus"which was later found to be more accuratebut was based on "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries". These skulls were likely those of "Camarasaurus", the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find "Apatosaurus" skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was "largely conjectural and based on that of "Morosaurus"" (now "Camarasaurus").

In 1903 <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer Riggs</a> published a study that described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the <a href="Grand%20Valley%20%28Colorado-Utah%29">Grand River Valley</a> near <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita, Colorado</a>, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh had described "Brontosaurus". Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both "Brontosaurus" and "Apatosaurus ajax", Riggs realized that the holotype of "A.ajax" was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since "Apatosaurus" was the earlier name, "Brontosaurus" should be considered a junior synonym of "Apatosaurus". Because of this, Riggs recombined "Brontosaurus excelsus" as "Apatosaurus excelsus". Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to "Apatosaurus", Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to "A.excelsus".

Despite Riggs' publication, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>, who was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa, labeled the "Apatosaurus" mount of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> "Brontosaurus". Because of this decision the name "Brontosaurus" was commonly used outside of scientific literature for what Riggs considered "Apatosaurus", and the museum's popularity meant that "Brontosaurus" became one of the best known dinosaurs, even though it was invalid throughout nearly all of the 20th and early 21st centuries.

It was not until 1909 that an "Apatosaurus" skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would become known as the Carnegie Quarry at <a href="Dinosaur%20National%20Monument">Dinosaur National Monument</a>. The skull was found a short distance from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species "Apatosaurus louisae", named after <a href="Louise%20Whitfield%20Carnegie">Louise Carnegie</a>, wife of <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. The skull was designated CM11162; it was very similar to the skull of "Diplodocus". Another smaller skeleton of "A.louisae" was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. The skull was accepted as belonging to the "Apatosaurus" specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, museum staff placed a cast of a "Camarasaurus" skull on the mount.

While most other museums were using cast or sculpted "Camarasaurus" skulls on "Apatosaurus" mounts, the Yale Peabody Museum decided to sculpt a skull based on the lower jaw of a "Camarasaurus", with the cranium based on Marsh's 1891 illustration of the skull. The skull also included forward-pointing nasalssomething different to any dinosaurand fenestrae differing from both the drawing and other skulls.

No "Apatosaurus" skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of "Diplodocus" and "Apatosaurus". They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that "Apatosaurus" had a "Diplodocus"-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to "Diplodocus" might instead be those of "Apatosaurus". They reassigned multiple skulls to "Apatosaurus" based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, it was noted that "Apatosaurus" might have possessed a "Camarasaurus"-like skull, based on a disarticulated "Camarasaurus"-like tooth found at the precise site where an "Apatosaurus" specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of "Apatosaurus" was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>". In 2011 the first specimen of "Apatosaurus" where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, <a href="Cincinnati%20Museum%20Center">CMC</a>VP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from "A.louisae", but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with "A.ajax". Another well-preserved skull is <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>.

Almost all modern paleontologists agreed with Riggs that the two dinosaurs should be classified together in a single genus. According to the rules of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a> (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name "Apatosaurus", having been published first, has priority as the official name; "Brontosaurus" was considered a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> and was therefore long discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologist<a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>argued in the 1990s that "A.ajax" and "A.excelsus" were in fact sufficiently distinct for the latter to merit a separate genus.

In 2015 Emanuel Tschopp, <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Mateus">Octávio Mateus</a>, and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics, and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by thirteen differing characters, and species separated based on six. The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that "A.ajax" and "A.louisae" differ in twelve characters, and "Diplodocus carnegiei" and "D.hallorum" differ in eleven characters. Thus, thirteen characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera. The six differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species, with only one differing character in "D.carnegiei" and "A.louisae", but five differing features in "B.excelsus". Therefore, Tschopp etal. argued that "Apatosaurus excelsus", originally classified as "Brontosaurus excelsus", had enough morphological differences from other species of "Apatosaurus" that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again. The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals. Among the many notable differences are the widerand presumably strongerneck of "Apatosaurus" species compared to "B.excelsus". Other species previously assigned to "Apatosaurus", such as "Elosaurus parvus" and "Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin" were also reclassified as "Brontosaurus". Some features proposed to separate "Brontosaurus" from "Apatosaurus" include: posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide; the scapula rear to the <a href="acromion">acromial edge</a> and the distal blade being excavated; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bearing a rounded expansion; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the <a href="Talus%20bone">astragalus</a> 0.55 or greater. Sauropod expert <a href="Michael%20Daniel%20D%27Emic">Michael Daniel D'Emic</a> pointed out that the criteria chosen were to an extent arbitrary and that they would require abandoning the name "Brontosaurus" again if newer analyses obtained different results. Mammal palaeontologist <a href="Donald%20Prothero">Donald Prothero</a> criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature, concluding that he would keep "Brontosaurus" in quotes and not treat the name as a valid genus.

Many species of "Apatosaurus" have been designated from scant material. Marsh named as many species as he could, which resulted in many being based upon fragmentary and indistinguishable remains. In 2005 Paul Upchurch and colleagues published a study that analyzed the species and specimen relationships of "Apatosaurus". They found that "A.louisae" was the most basal species, followed by FMNHP25112, and then a <a href="polytomy">polytomy</a> of "A.ajax", "A.parvus", and "A.excelsus". Their analysis was revised and expanded with many additional diplodocid specimens in 2015, which resolved the relationships of "Apatosaurus" slightly differently, and also supported separating "Brontosaurus" from "Apatosaurus".


The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below is the result of an analysis by Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). The authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus.


"Apatosaurus" is a member of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Diplodocidae">Diplodocidae</a>, a <a href="cladistics">clade</a> of gigantic <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. The family includes some of the longest creatures ever to walk the earth, including "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", "Supersaurus", and "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>". "Apatosaurus" is sometimes classified in the subfamily <a href="Apatosaurinae">Apatosaurinae</a>, which may also include "<a href="Suuwassea">Suuwassea</a>", "Supersaurus", and "Brontosaurus". <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a> described "Apatosaurus" as allied to "Atlantosaurus" within the now-defunct group <a href="Atlantosauridae">Atlantosauridae</a>. In 1878 Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including "Apatosaurus", "Atlantosaurus", "Morosaurus" (="Camarasaurus") and "Diplodocus". He classified this group within Sauropoda, a group he erected in the same study. In 1903 <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer S. Riggs</a> said the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names; he grouped "Apatosaurus" within <a href="Opisthocoelia">Opisthocoelia</a>. Sauropoda is still used as the group name. In 2011, John Whitlock published a study that placed "Apatosaurus" a more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> diplodocid, sometimes less basal than "Supersaurus".

<a href="Cladogram">Cladogram</a> of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015).

It was believed throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like "Apatosaurus" were too massive to support their own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now thought to have been fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square <a href="snout">snout</a>, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of the teeth of "Apatosaurus" suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>. It may have eaten <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="cycadeoid">cycadeoid</a>s, <a href="seed%20fern">seed fern</a>s, <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s, and <a href="algae">algae</a>. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.

A 2015 study of the necks of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" found many differences between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that the necks of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" were used for <a href="intraspecific%20combat">intraspecific combat</a>. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.

Trackways of sauropods like "Apatosaurus" show that they may have had a range of around per day, and that they could potentially have reached a top speed of per hour. The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to their minimal muscling, or to recoil after strides. A trackway of a juvenile has led some to believe that they were capable of bipedalism, though this is disputed.

Diplodocids like "Apatosaurus" are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like "Apatosaurus" were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.

Other studies by Taylor find that all <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a>s appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. "Apatosaurus", like "Diplodocus", would have held its neck angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state "Apatosaurus" had a great feeding range; its neck could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed at the level of the feet.

Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, finding that large muscles and cartilage would have limited movement of the neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like "Diplodocus" were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of the neck of "Apatosaurus" and "Diplodocus". He found that the neck of "Apatosaurus" was very flexible.

Given the large body mass and long neck of sauropods like "Apatosaurus", physiologists have encountered problems determining how these animals breathed. Beginning with the assumption that, like <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns, "Apatosaurus" did not have a <a href="thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, the <a href="dead%20space%20%28physiology%29">dead-space volume</a> (the amount of unused air remaining in the mouth, trachea, and air tubes after each breath) has been estimated at about for a specimen. Paladino calculates its <a href="lung%20volumes">tidal volume</a> (the amount of air moved in or out during a single breath) at with an avian respiratory system, if mammalian, and if reptilian.

On this basis, its respiratory system would likely have been <a href="parabronchi">parabronchi</a>, with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in <a href="avian%20lungs">avian lungs</a>, and a flow-through lung. An avian respiratory system would need a lung volume of about compared with a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of "Apatosaurus" has been estimated at , allowing for a , four-chambered heart and a lung capacity. That would allow about for the necessary tissue. Evidence for the avian system in "Apatosaurus" and other sauropods is also present in the <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumaticity</a> of the vertebrae. Though this plays a role in reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.

James Spotila et al. (1991) concludes that the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates because they would not have been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.

James Farlow (1987) calculates that an "Apatosaurus"-sized dinosaur about would have possessed of fermentation contents. Assuming "Apatosaurus" had an avian respiratory system and a reptilian resting-metabolism, Frank Paladino etal. (1997) estimate the animal would have needed to consume only about of water per day.

A 1999 microscopic study of "Apatosaurus" and "Brontosaurus" bones concluded the animals grew rapidly when young and reached near-adult sizes in about 10years. In 2008, a study on the growth rates of sauropods was published by Thomas Lehman and Holly Woodward. They said that by using growth lines and length-to-mass ratios, "Apatosaurus" would have grown to 25t (25 long tons; 28 short tons) in 15years, with growth peaking at in a single year. An alternative method, using limb length and body mass, found "Apatosaurus" grew per year, and reached its full mass before it was about 70years old. These estimates have been called unreliable because the calculation methods are not sound; old growth lines would have been obliterated by bone remodelling. One of the first identified growth factors of "Apatosaurus" was the number of sacral vertebrae, which increased to five by the time of the creature's maturity. This was first noted in 1903 and again in 1936.

Long-bone histology enables researchers to estimate the age that a specific individual reached. A study by Eva Griebeler etal. (2013) examined long-bone histological data and concluded the "Apatosaurus" sp.SMA0014 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 21years, and died aged 28. The same growth model indicated "Apatosaurus" sp.BYU 601–17328 weighed , reached sexual maturity at 19years, and died aged 31.

Compared with most sauropods, a relatively large amount of juvenile material is known from "Apatosaurus". Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of "Apatosaurus"; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic girdles, some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish "Apatosaurus" from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.

An article published in 1997 reported research of the mechanics of "Apatosaurus" tails by <a href="Nathan%20Myhrvold">Nathan Myhrvold</a> and paleontologist <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a>. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like "Apatosaurus" was a very long, tapering structure resembling a <a href="bullwhip">bullwhip</a>. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.

A pathology has been identified on the tail of "Apatosaurus", caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might have been caused by the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>" and <a href="mamenchisaurid">mamenchisaurid</a>s, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.

The <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>, dates from between 156.3<a href="Year%23Abbreviations%20yr%20and%20ya">mya</a> at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late <a href="Oxfordian%20stage">Oxfordian</a>, <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a>, and early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> <a href="faunal%20stages">stages</a> of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a> environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the <a href="Front%20Range">Front Range</a> of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a> in Portugal and the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru Formation</a> in Tanzania.
"Apatosaurus" was the second most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after "Camarasaurus". "Apatosaurus" may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. "Supersaurus" has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. "Apatosaurus" fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of "Apatosaurus ajax" are known exclusively from the upper <a href="Brushy%20Basin%20Member">Brushy Basin Member</a>, about 152–151 mya. "A.louisae" fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional "Apatosaurus" remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to "Brontosaurus".

The Morrison Formation records a time when the local environment was dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the theropods "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "<a href="Saurophaganax">Saurophaganax</a>", and "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>"; the sauropods "Brontosaurus", "Brachiosaurus", "Camarasaurus", and "Diplodocus"; and the <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Apatosaurus" is commonly found at the same sites as "Allosaurus", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", and "Stegosaurus". "Allosaurus" accounted for 70–75% of theropod specimens and was at the top <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> of the Morrison food web. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are of the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks of the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a>mainly "Allosaurus", "Ceratosaurus", and "Torvosaurus"or have a close counterpart"Brachiosaurus" and "<a href="Lusotitan">Lusotitan</a>", "Camptosaurus" and "<a href="Draconyx">Draconyx</a>", and "Apatosaurus" and "<a href="Dinheirosaurus">Dinheirosaurus</a>". Other vertebrates that are known to have shared this paleo-environment include <a href="actinopterygii">ray-finned fishes</a>, frogs, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s, turtles, <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodonts</a>, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorpha</a>ns, and several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>. Shells of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been evidenced in fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, <a href="equisetum">horsetails</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>es, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s with fern <a href="understory">understory</a> (<a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s), to fern <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s with occasional trees such as the "<a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>"-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

Allosaurus

Allosaurus () is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of large <a href="theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived 155 to 150 million years ago during the <a href="late%20Jurassic">late Jurassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">period</a> (<a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> to early <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a>). The name ""Allosaurus"" means "different lizard". It is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> /"allos" ("different, other") and /"sauros" ("lizard / generic reptile"). The first fossil remains that could definitively be ascribed to this genus were described in 1877 by paleontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>. These remains became known as "<a href="Antrodemus">Antrodemus</a>". As one of the first well-known theropod dinosaurs, it has long attracted attention outside of <a href="paleontology">paleontological</a> circles. Indeed, it has been a top feature in several <a href="film">film</a>s and <a href="documentary%20film">documentaries</a> about prehistoric life.

"Allosaurus" was a large <a href="biped">biped</a>al <a href="predation">predator</a>. Its <a href="skull">skull</a> was large and equipped with dozens of sharp, serrated <a href="tooth">teeth</a>. It averaged in length, though fragmentary remains suggest it could have reached over . Relative to the large and powerful hindlimbs, its three-fingered forelimbs were small, and the body was balanced by a long and heavily muscled tail. It is classified as an <a href="allosaurid">allosaurid</a>, a type of <a href="carnosauria">carnosauria</a>n theropod dinosaur. The genus has a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, and includes an uncertain number of valid <a href="species">species</a>, the best known of which is "A. fragilis". The bulk of "Allosaurus" remains have come from <a href="North%20America">North America</a>'s <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>, with material also known from <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> and possibly <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. It was known for over half of the 20th century as "<a href="Antrodemus">Antrodemus</a>", but a study of the copious remains from the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a> brought the name ""Allosaurus"" back to prominence and established it as one of the best-known dinosaurs.

As the most abundant large predator in the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>, "Allosaurus" was at the top of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>, probably preying on contemporaneous large herbivorous dinosaurs, and perhaps even other predators. Potential prey included <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a>s, <a href="stegosaurid">stegosaurid</a>s, and <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s. Some paleontologists interpret "Allosaurus" as having had cooperative <a href="social%20behavior">social behavior</a>, and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses. It may have attacked large prey by ambush, using its upper jaw like a <a href="hatchet">hatchet</a>.

"Allosaurus" was a typical large <a href="theropod">theropod</a>, having a massive <a href="skull">skull</a> on a short <a href="neck">neck</a>, a long <a href="tail">tail</a> and reduced forelimbs. "Allosaurus fragilis", the best-known species, had an average length of , with the largest definitive "Allosaurus" specimen (<a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">AMNH</a> 680) estimated at long, and an estimated weight of . In his 1976 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on "Allosaurus", <a href="James%20Henry%20Madsen%20Jr.">James H. Madsen</a> mentioned a range of bone sizes which he interpreted to show a maximum length of . As with dinosaurs in general, weight estimates are debatable, and since 1980 have ranged between , , and for <a href="mode%20%28statistics%29">modal</a> adult weight (not maximum). John Foster, a specialist on the Morrison Formation, suggests that is reasonable for large adults of "A. fragilis", but that is a closer estimate for individuals represented by the average-sized <a href="femur">thigh bones</a> he has measured. Using the subadult specimen nicknamed "Big Al", researchers using computer modelling arrived at a best estimate of for the individual, but by varying parameters they found a range from approximately to approximately .

Several <a href="Specimens%20of%20Allosaurus">gigantic specimens</a> have been attributed to "Allosaurus", but may in fact belong to other genera. The closely related genus "<a href="Saurophaganax">Saurophaganax</a>" (<a href="Sam%20Noble%20Oklahoma%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">OMNH</a> 1708) reached perhaps in length, and its single species has sometimes been included in the genus "Allosaurus" as "Allosaurus maximus", though recent studies support it as a separate genus. Another potential <a href="Specimens%20of%20Allosaurus">specimen of "Allosaurus"</a>, once assigned to the genus "<a href="Epanterias">Epanterias</a>" (AMNH 5767), may have measured in length. A more recent discovery is a partial skeleton from the Peterson Quarry in Morrison rocks of <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>; this large allosaurid may be another individual of "Saurophaganax".

The skull and teeth of "Allosaurus" were modestly proportioned for a theropod of its size. Paleontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> gives a length of for a skull belonging to an individual he estimates at long. Each <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> (the bones that formed the tip of the snout), held five teeth with D-shaped cross-sections, and each <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth; the number of teeth does not exactly correspond to the size of the bone. Each <a href="dentary">dentary</a> (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, narrower, and more curved toward the back of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges. They were shed easily, and were replaced continually, making them common fossils.

The skull had a pair of <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a> above and in front of the eyes. These horns were composed of extensions of the <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>s, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a <a href="keratin">keratin</a> sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in <a href="tyrannosauridae">tyrannosaurids</a>.

Inside the lacrimal bones were depressions that may have held <a href="gland">gland</a>s, such as <a href="salt%20gland">salt gland</a>s. Within the maxillae were <a href="Maxillary%20sinus">sinuses</a> that were better developed than those of more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> theropods such as "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Marshosaurus">Marshosaurus</a>"; they may have been related to the <a href="sense%20of%20smell">sense of smell</a>, perhaps holding something like <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">Jacobson's organ</a>. The roof of the braincase was thin, perhaps to improve <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> for the <a href="brain">brain</a>. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> and <a href="frontal%20bone">frontals</a> may also have had a joint.

"Allosaurus" had nine <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e in the neck, 14 in the back, and five in the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; <a href="James%20Henry%20Madsen%20Jr.">James Madsen</a> estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">anterior</a> back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held <a href="Parabronchi">air sacs</a> used in <a href="respiratory%20system">respiration</a>. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> theropods like "Ceratosaurus". "Allosaurus" had <a href="gastralium">gastralia</a> (belly ribs), but these are not common findings, and they may have <a href="ossification">ossified</a> poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A <a href="furcula">furcula</a> (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>, the main hip bone, was massive, and the <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubic bone</a> had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a>, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual characteristic</a>, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.

The forelimbs of "Allosaurus" were short in comparison to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed <a href="claw">claw</a>s. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2 <a href="ulna">ulna</a>/<a href="humerus">humerus</a> ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate <a href="carpus">carpal</a> also found in more derived theropods like <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>ns. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or <a href="thumb">thumb</a>) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a>s, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more <a href="hoof">hoof</a>-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner <a href="dewclaw">dewclaw</a>, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) <a href="metatarsus">metatarsal</a>, perhaps used as a lever between the <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a> and foot.

"Allosaurus" was an allosaurid, a member of a <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of large theropods within the larger group <a href="Carnosauria">Carnosauria</a>. The family name <a href="Allosauridae">Allosauridae</a> was created for this genus in 1878 by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, but the term was largely unused until the 1970s in favor of <a href="Megalosauridae">Megalosauridae</a>, another family of large theropods that eventually became a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a>. This, along with the use of "Antrodemus" for "Allosaurus" during the same period, is a point that needs to be remembered when searching for information on "Allosaurus" in publications that predate James Madsen's 1976 monograph. Major publications using the name "Megalosauridae" instead of "Allosauridae" include <a href="Charles%20Gilmore">Gilmore</a>, 1920, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">von Huene</a>, 1926, <a href="Alfred%20Sherwood%20Romer">Romer</a>, 1956 and 1966, Steel, 1970, and <a href="Alick%20Walker">Walker</a>, 1964.
Following the publication of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae for a variety of large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to "Allosaurus" included "<a href="Indosaurus">Indosaurus</a>", "<a href="Piatnitzkysaurus">Piatnitzkysaurus</a>", "<a href="Piveteausaurus">Piveteausaurus</a>", "<a href="Yangchuanosaurus">Yangchuanosaurus</a>", "<a href="Acrocanthosaurus">Acrocanthosaurus</a>", "<a href="Chilantaisaurus">Chilantaisaurus</a>", "<a href="Compsosuchus">Compsosuchus</a>", "<a href="Stokesosaurus">Stokesosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Szechuanosaurus">Szechuanosaurus</a>". Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity and the advent of cladistic study of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like "Acrocanthosaurus" and "Yangchuanosaurus", are members of closely related families.

Below is a cladogram by Benson "et al." in 2010.

Allosauridae is one of four families in Carnosauria; the other three are <a href="Neovenatoridae">Neovenatoridae</a>, <a href="Carcharodontosauridae">Carcharodontosauridae</a> and <a href="Sinraptoridae">Sinraptoridae</a>. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the <a href="Tyrannosauridae">Tyrannosauridae</a> (which would make it <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's "Predatory Dinosaurs of the World", but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the <a href="Coelurosauria">Coelurosauria</a>. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only "Saurophaganax" and a currently unnamed <a href="France">French</a> <a href="allosauroidea">allosauroid</a> accepted as possible valid <a href="genus">genera</a> besides "Allosaurus" in the most recent review. Another genus, "Epanterias", is a potential valid member, but it and "Saurophaganax" may turn out to be large examples of "Allosaurus". Recent reviews have kept the genus "Saurophaganax" and included "Epanterias" with "Allosaurus".

The discovery and early study of "Allosaurus" is complicated by the multiplicity of names coined during the <a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a> of the late 19th century. The first described <a href="fossil">fossil</a> in this history was a bone obtained secondhand by <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandiveer%20Hayden">Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden</a> in 1869. It came from <a href="Middle%20Park%20%28Colorado%20basin%29">Middle Park</a>, near <a href="Granby%2C%20Colorado">Granby, Colorado</a>, probably from <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a> rocks. The locals had identified such bones as "petrified <a href="horse">horse</a> hoofs". Hayden sent his specimen to <a href="Joseph%20Leidy">Joseph Leidy</a>, who identified it as half of a tail vertebra, and tentatively assigned it to the European dinosaur genus "<a href="Poekilopleuron">Poekilopleuron</a>" as "Poicilopleuron" "valens". He later decided it deserved its own genus, "Antrodemus".

"Allosaurus" itself is <a href="holotype">based on</a> <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">YPM</a> 1930, a small collection of fragmentary bones including parts of three vertebrae, a rib fragment, a tooth, a toe bone, and, most useful for later discussions, the shaft of the right humerus (upper arm). Othniel Charles Marsh gave these remains the formal name "Allosaurus fragilis" in 1877. "Allosaurus" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "allos/αλλος", meaning "strange" or "different" and "sauros/σαυρος", meaning "lizard" or "reptile". It was named 'different lizard' because its vertebrae were different from those of other dinosaurs known at the time of its discovery. The species epithet "fragilis" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "fragile", referring to lightening features in the vertebrae. The bones were collected from the Morrison Formation of <a href="Garden%20Park%2C%20Colorado">Garden Park</a>, north of <a href="Ca%C3%B1on%20City%2C%20Colorado">Cañon City</a>. Marsh and <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a>, who were in scientific competition, went on to coin several other genera based on similarly sparse material that would later figure in the taxonomy of "Allosaurus". These include Marsh's "Creosaurus" and "Labrosaurus", and Cope's "Epanterias".

In their haste, Cope and Marsh did not always follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the discovery by <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Mudge">Benjamin Mudge</a> of the type specimen of "Allosaurus" in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete "Allosaurus" and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the <a href="Como%20Bluff">Como Bluff</a> area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it was found to be one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>" skeleton as if <a href="scavenger">scavenging</a> it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.

The multiplicity of early names complicated later research, with the situation compounded by the terse descriptions provided by Marsh and Cope. Even at the time, authors such as <a href="Samuel%20Wendell%20Williston">Samuel Wendell Williston</a> suggested that too many names had been coined. For example, Williston pointed out in 1901 that Marsh had never been able to adequately distinguish "Allosaurus" from "Creosaurus". The most influential early attempt to sort out the convoluted situation was produced by <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Charles W. Gilmore</a> in 1920. He came to the conclusion that the tail vertebra named "Antrodemus" by Leidy was indistinguishable from those of "Allosaurus", and "Antrodemus" thus should be the preferred name because as the older name it had priority. "Antrodemus" became the accepted name for this familiar genus for over fifty years, until James Madsen published on the Cleveland-Lloyd specimens and concluded that "Allosaurus" should be used because "Antrodemus" was based on material with poor, if any, diagnostic features and locality information (for example, the <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a> that the single bone of "Antrodemus" came from is unknown). ""Antrodemus"" has been used informally for convenience when distinguishing between the skull Gilmore restored and the composite skull restored by Madsen.

Although sporadic work at what became known as the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a> in <a href="Emery%20County%2C%20Utah">Emery County</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a> had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by <a href="William%20Lee%20Stokes">William L. Stokes</a> in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40 institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965. The quarry is notable for the predominance of "Allosaurus" remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod "Allosaurus fragilis" (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46 "A. fragilis" have been found there, out of at minimum 73 dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to <a href="drought">drought</a>-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved "Allosaurus" remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods. Skeletal remains from the quarry pertain to individuals of almost all ages and sizes, from less than to long, and the disarticulation is an advantage for describing bones usually found fused.

The period since Madsen's monograph has been marked by a great expansion in studies dealing with topics concerning "Allosaurus" in life (<a href="paleobiology">paleobiological</a> and <a href="paleoecology">paleoecological</a> topics). Such studies have covered topics including skeletal variation, growth, skull construction, hunting methods, the <a href="brain">brain</a>, and the possibility of gregarious living and parental care. Reanalysis of old material (particularly of large 'allosaur' specimens), new discoveries in Portugal, and several very complete new specimens have also contributed to the growing knowledge base.

In 1991 "Big Al" (<a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Rockies">MOR</a> 693), a 95% complete, partially articulated specimen of "Allosaurus" was discovered. It measured about 8 meters (about 26 ft) in length. MOR 693 was excavated near <a href="Shell%2C%20Wyoming">Shell, Wyoming</a>, by a joint Museum of the Rockies and <a href="University%20of%20Wyoming">University of Wyoming</a> Geological Museum team. This skeleton was discovered by a Swiss team, led by Kirby Siber. In 1996 the same team discovered a second "Allosaurus", "Big Al Two", which is the best preserved skeleton of its kind to date.

The completeness, preservation, and scientific importance of this skeleton gave "Big Al" its name; the individual itself was below the average size for "Allosaurus fragilis", and was a subadult estimated at only 87% grown. The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of <a href="infection">infection</a>, which may have contributed to "Big Al's" death. <a href="Paleopathology">Pathologic</a> bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a>, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait. Al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an <a href="involucrum">involucrum</a>. The infection was long lived, perhaps up to 6 months. Big Al Two is also known to have multiple injuries.

There are currently four valid and one undescribed species of "Allosaurus" ("A. amplus", "A. europaeus", the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "A. fragilis", the as-yet not formally described "A. jimmadseni", and "A. lucasi").

"A. fragilis", "A. jimmadseni", "A. amplus", and "A. lucasi" are all known from remains discovered in the <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a>–<a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a> <a href="Upper%20Jurassic">Upper Jurassic</a>-age Morrison Formation of the United States, spread across the states of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>, Utah, and Wyoming. "A. fragilis" is regarded as the most common, known from the remains of at least sixty individuals. For a while in the late 1980s and early 1990s it was common to recognize "A. fragilis" as the short-snouted species, with the long-snouted taxon being "A. atrox"; however, subsequent analysis of specimens from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Como Bluff, and Dry Mesa Quarry showed that the differences seen in the Morrison Formation material could be attributed to individual variation. A study of skull elements from the Cleveland-Lloyd site found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species-level distinctions based on such features as the shape of the lacrimal horns, and the proposed differentiation of "A. jimmadseni" based on the shape of the <a href="jugal">jugal</a>. "A. europaeus" was found in the Kimmeridgian-age Porto Novo Member of the <a href="Lourinh%C3%A3%20Formation">Lourinhã Formation</a>, but may be the same as "A. fragilis".

"Allosaurus tendagurensis" was found in Kimmeridgian-age rocks of <a href="Tendaguru">Tendaguru</a>, in <a href="Mtwara%20Region">Mtwara</a>, Tanzania. Subsequent studies classified it as a non-coelurosaurian tetanuran, either a megalosaurid or carcharodontosaur. Although obscure, it was a large theropod, possibly around long and in weight.

"Allosaurus" is regarded as senior synonym of the genera "Creosaurus", "Epanterias", and "Labrosaurus". Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of "A. fragilis", or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is "Labrosaurus ferox", named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was <a href="pathology">pathologic</a>, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of "A. fragilis."

Other remains formerly thought to pertain to "Allosaurus" were described from <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, but these fossils have been reassessed as belonging to other dinosaurs.

The issue of synonyms is complicated by the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> of "Allosaurus fragilis" (catalog number <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">YPM</a> 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have interpreted the type specimen as potentially dubious, and thus the genus "Allosaurus" itself or at least the species "A. fragilis" would be a "nomen dubium" ("dubious name", based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). To address this situation, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> (2010) submitted a petition to the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a> to have the name ""A. fragilis"" officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a <a href="Hapantotype">neotype</a>). This request is currently pending review.

The wealth of "Allosaurus" fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows scientists to study how the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of "Allosaurus". Based on <a href="Histology">histological</a> analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears to stop at around 22 to 28 years, which is comparable to that of other large theropods like "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age 15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150 kilograms (330 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>) per year.

Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, mineralization located inside the medulla of the long bones in gravid female birds) has been reported in at least one "Allosaurus" specimen, a <a href="tibia">shin bone</a> from the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry</a>. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply <a href="calcium">calcium</a> to shells. Its presence in the "Allosaurus" individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this "Allosaurus" individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this "Allosaurus" individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of "Tyrannosaurus", it may be possible to ascertain whether or not the "Allosaurus" in question was indeed female.
The discovery of a juvenile specimen with a nearly complete hindlimb shows that the legs were relatively longer in juveniles, and the lower segments of the leg (shin and foot) were relatively longer than the thigh. These differences suggest that younger "Allosaurus" were faster and had different hunting strategies than adults, perhaps chasing small prey as juveniles, then becoming ambush hunters of large prey upon adulthood. The thigh bone became thicker and wider during growth, and the cross-section less circular, as muscle attachments shifted, muscles became shorter, and the growth of the leg slowed. These changes imply that juvenile legs has less predictable stresses compared with adults, which would have moved with more regular forward progression. Conversely, the skull bones appear to have generally grown <a href="allometry">isometrically</a>, increasing in size without changing in proportion.

Paleontologists accept "Allosaurus" as an active predator of large animals. There is dramatic evidence for allosaur attacks on "Stegosaurus", including an "Allosaurus" tail vertebra with a partially healed puncture wound that fits a "Stegosaurus" <a href="thagomizer">tail spike</a>, and a "Stegosaurus" neck plate with a U-shaped wound that correlates well with an "Allosaurus" snout. <a href="Sauropod">Sauropod</a>s seem to be likely candidates as both live prey and as objects of <a href="scavenging">scavenging</a>, based on the presence of scrapings on sauropod bones fitting allosaur teeth well and the presence of shed allosaur teeth with sauropod bones. However, as Gregory Paul noted in 1988, "Allosaurus" was probably not a predator of fully grown sauropods, unless it hunted in packs, as it had a modestly sized skull and relatively small teeth, and was greatly outweighed by contemporaneous sauropods. Another possibility is that it preferred to hunt juveniles instead of fully grown adults. Research in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century may have found other solutions to this question. <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>, comparing "Allosaurus" to <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> sabre-toothed carnivorous mammals, found similar adaptations, such as a reduction of jaw muscles and increase in neck muscles, and the ability to open the jaws extremely wide. Although "Allosaurus" did not have sabre teeth, Bakker suggested another mode of attack that would have used such neck and jaw adaptations: the short teeth in effect became small serrations on a <a href="saw">saw</a>-like cutting edge running the length of the upper jaw, which would have been driven into prey. This type of jaw would permit slashing attacks against much larger prey, with the goal of weakening the victim.

Similar conclusions were drawn by another study using <a href="finite%20element%20analysis">finite element analysis</a> on an "Allosaurus" skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148 <a href="Newton%20%28unit%29">N</a>, less than the values for <a href="alligator">alligator</a>s (13,000 N), <a href="lion">lion</a>s (4,167 N), and <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s (2,268 N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500 N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that "Allosaurus" used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike "Tyrannosaurus", which is thought to have been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that "Allosaurus" itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the <a href="palate">palate</a> and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like "Allosaurus" were "flesh grazers" which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager "et al." from the University of Bristol also indicate "Allosaurus" could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with "Tyrannosaurus" and the therizinosaurid "<a href="Erlikosaurus">Erlikosaurus</a>" in the same study, it was found that "Allosaurus" had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.

A <a href="biomechanics">biomechanical</a> study published in 2013 by Eric Snively and colleagues found that "Allosaurus" had an unusually low attachment point on the skull for the <a href="longissimus%20capitis%20superficialis">longissimus capitis superficialis</a> neck muscle compared to other theropods such as "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". This would have allowed the animal to make rapid and forceful vertical movements with the skull. The authors found that vertical strikes as proposed by Bakker and Rayfield are consistent with the animal's capabilities. They also found that the animal probably processed carcasses by vertical movements in a similar manner to <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s, such as <a href="kestrel">kestrel</a>s: the animal could have gripped prey with the skull and feet, then pulled back and up to remove flesh. This differs from the prey-handling envisioned for tyrannosaurids, which probably tore flesh with lateral shakes of the skull, similar to crocodilians. In addition, "Allosaurus" was able to "move its head and neck around relatively rapidly and with considerable control", at the cost of power.

Other aspects of feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The shape of the skull of "Allosaurus" limited potential <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> to 20° of width, slightly less than that of modern <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns. As with crocodilians, this may have been enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of "Allosaurus" has been estimated at 30 to 55 kilometers per hour (19 to 34 miles per hour).

A new paper on the cranio-dental morphology of "Allosaurus" and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack unlikely, reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off to allow for the widened gape.

It has been speculated since the 1970s that "Allosaurus" preyed on sauropods and other large dinosaurs by hunting in groups.
Such a depiction is common in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior to parental care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions with members of the same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named "Labrosaurus ferox" is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a <a href="pack%20hunter">pack</a> or to settle <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> disputes.

Although "Allosaurus" may have hunted in packs, it has been argued that "Allosaurus" and other theropods had largely aggressive interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s in general, and modern <a href="diapsid">diapsid</a> carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and <a href="cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">cannibalize</a> intruders of the same species, and will also do the same to smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple "Allosaurus" individuals at the same site, e.g. in the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry</a>, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that "Allosaurus" individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s and <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>s. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in "Allosaurus", including "Allosaurus" shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a <a href="scapula">shoulder blade</a>, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.

The brain of "Allosaurus", as interpreted from spiral <a href="computed%20tomography">CT scanning</a> of an <a href="endocranial%20cast">endocast</a>, was more consistent with <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>n brains than those of the other living <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s, birds. The structure of the <a href="vestibular%20system">vestibular apparatus</a> indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> was like that of a crocodilian, and so "Allosaurus" probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for <a href="stress%20fractures">stress fractures</a> and <a href="tendon%20avulsions">tendon avulsions</a> in <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or <a href="animal%20migration">migration</a>, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. "Allosaurus" was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that "Allosaurus" had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than "<a href="Albertosaurus">Albertosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornithomimus">Ornithomimus</a>" or "<a href="Archaeornithomimus">Archaeornithomimus</a>". Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones "were distributed to the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximal</a> <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>" and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in "statistically indistinguishable" numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined "Allosaurus" fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in "Allosaurus" provide evidence for "very active" predation-based rather than scavenging diets.

The left <a href="scapula">scapula</a> and <a href="fibula">fibula</a> of an "<a href="Allosaurus%20fragilis">Allosaurus fragilis</a>" specimen catalogued as USNM 4734 are both pathological, both probably due to healed fractures. The specimen USNM 8367 preserved several pathological gastralia which preserve evidence of healed fractures near their middle. Some of the fractures were poorly healed and "formed pseudoarthroses." A specimen with a fractured rib was recovered from the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry</a>. Another specimen had fractured ribs and fused vertebrae near the end of the tail. An apparent subadult male "<a href="Allosaurus%20fragilis">Allosaurus fragilis</a>" was reported to have extensive pathologies, with a total of fourteen separate injuries. The specimen MOR 693 had pathologies on five ribs, the sixth neck vertebra the third eighth and thirteenth back vertebrae, the second tail vertebra and its chevron, the <a href="gastralia">gastralia</a> right scapula, manual phalanx I left <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> metatarsals III and V, the first phalanx of the third toe and the third phalanx of the second. The ilium had "a large hole... caused by a blow from above".The near end of the first phalanx of the third toe was afflicted by an <a href="involucrum">involucrum</a>.

Other pathologies reported in "Allosaurus" include: <a href="Willow%20breaks">Willow breaks</a> in two ribs. Healed fractures in the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> and <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a>.

"Allosaurus" was the most common large theropod in the vast tract of <a href="American%20West">Western American</a> fossil-bearing rock known as the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>, accounting for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens, and as such was at the top <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> of the Morrison <a href="food%20chain">food web</a>. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a> environment with distinct <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>s, and flat <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s. Vegetation varied from <a href="river">river</a>-lining forests of <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s, and <a href="fern">fern</a>s (<a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s), to fern <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s with occasional trees such as the "<a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>"-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

The Morrison Formation has been a rich fossil hunting ground. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of <a href="chlorophyta">green algae</a>, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="equisetum">horsetails</a>, ferns, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>es, and several families of <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s. Animal fossils discovered include <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="actinopterygii">ray-finned fishes</a>, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s, <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodonts</a>, <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, terrestrial and aquatic <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorpha</a>ns, several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>, numerous dinosaur species, and early <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s such as <a href="docodonta">docodonts</a>, <a href="multituberculata">multituberculates</a>, <a href="symmetrodonta">symmetrodonts</a>, and <a href="triconodonta">triconodonts</a>. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "<a href="Tanycolagreus">Tanycolagreus</a>", and "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>", the <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s "<a href="Haplocanthosaurus">Haplocanthosaurus</a>", "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>", "<a href="Cathetosaurus">Cathetosaurus</a>", "<a href="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Suuwassea">Suuwassea</a>", "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>", "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>", "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>", "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>", "<a href="Supersaurus">Supersaurus</a>", and "<a href="Amphicoelias">Amphicoelias</a>", and the <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Allosaurus" is commonly found at the same sites as "Apatosaurus", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", and "Stegosaurus". The Late Jurassic formations of Portugal where "Allosaurus" is present are interpreted as having been similar to the Morrison but with a stronger <a href="ocean">marine</a> influence. Many of the dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation are the same genera as those seen in Portuguese rocks (mainly "Allosaurus", "Ceratosaurus", "Torvosaurus", and "Stegosaurus"), or have a close counterpart ("Brachiosaurus" and "<a href="Lusotitan">Lusotitan</a>", "Camptosaurus" and "<a href="Draconyx">Draconyx</a>").

"Allosaurus" coexisted with fellow large theropods "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>" in both the United States and Portugal. The three appear to have had different <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. Ceratosaurs and torvosaurs may have preferred to be active around waterways, and had lower, thinner bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas allosaurs were more compact, with longer legs, faster but less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. "Ceratosaurus", better known than "Torvosaurus", differed noticeably from "Allosaurus" in functional anatomy by having a taller, narrower skull with large, broad teeth. "Allosaurus" was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an "Allosaurus" <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubic foot</a> marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>" or "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>". The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs), and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton, indicates that the "Allosaurus" was being scavenged.

Along with "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", "Allosaurus" has come to represent the quintessential large, carnivorous dinosaur in western popular culture. It is a common dinosaur in American museums, due in particular to the excavations at the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a>; by 1976, as a result of cooperative operations, 38 museums in eight countries on three continents had Cleveland-Lloyd allosaur material or casts. "Allosaurus" is the official <a href="state%20fossil">state fossil</a> of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>.

"Allosaurus" has been depicted in popular culture since the early years of the 20th century. It is top predator in both <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s 1912 novel, "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%28Conan%20Doyle%20novel%29">The Lost World</a>", and its <a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%281925%20film%29">1925 film adaptation</a>, the first full-length motion picture to feature dinosaurs. "Allosaurus" was used as the starring dinosaur of the 1956 film "<a href="The%20Beast%20of%20Hollow%20Mountain">The Beast of Hollow Mountain</a>", and the 1969 film "<a href="The%20Valley%20of%20Gwangi">The Valley of Gwangi</a>", two <a href="genre">genre</a> combinations of living dinosaurs with <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a>. In "The Valley of Gwangi", Gwangi is billed as an "Allosaurus", although <a href="Ray%20Harryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a> based his model for the creature on Charles R. Knight's depiction of a "Tyrannosaurus". Harryhausen sometimes confuses the two, stating in a DVD interview "They're both meat eaters, they're both tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other." A male individual also appears in "" as the main antagonist, bent on making a meal out of the main characters. It also appears in a flashback in the <a href="The%20Land%20Before%20Time%20%28TV%20series%29">2007 TV series</a>.

"Allosaurus" appeared in the second episode of the 1999 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television series "<a href="Walking%20with%20Dinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a>" and the follow-up special "<a href="The%20Ballad%20of%20Big%20Al">The Ballad of Big Al</a>", which speculated on the life of the "Big Al" specimen, based on scientific evidence from the numerous injuries and pathologies in its skeleton. "Allosaurus" also made an appearance in the Discovery Channel series "<a href="Dinosaur%20Revolution">Dinosaur Revolution</a>". Its depiction in this series was based upon a specimen with a smashed lower jaw that was uncovered by paleontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Holtz</a>. "Allosaurus" appears in the 2011 BBC docu-mini-series "<a href="Planet%20Dinosaur">Planet Dinosaur</a>" in the episode "Fight for Life".

AK-47

The AK-47, or AK as it is officially known (), also known as the Kalashnikov, is a <a href="selective%20fire">selective-fire</a> (semi-automatic and fully automatic), <a href="gas%20operated">gas-operated</a> <a href="7.62%C3%9739mm">7.62×39mm</a> <a href="assault%20rifle">assault rifle</a>, developed in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> by <a href="Mikhail%20Kalashnikov">Mikhail Kalashnikov</a>. It is the originating firearm of the <a href="Kalashnikov%20rifle">Kalashnikov rifle</a> (or "AK") family.

Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a>. An early development of the design was the "AKS" (S—"Skladnoy" or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal <a href="stock%20%28firearms%29">shoulder stock</a>. In the spring of 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the <a href="Soviet%20Armed%20Forces">Soviet Armed Forces</a> and used by the majority of the member states of the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>.

Even after almost seven decades, the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as <a href="irregular%20military">irregular forces</a> and insurgencies worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual, crew-served and specialised firearms. As of 2004, "Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s".

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="StG%2044">Sturmgewehr 44</a> <a href="assault%20rifle">assault rifle</a> used by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> forces made a deep impression on their Soviet counterparts. The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new <a href="intermediate%20cartridge">intermediate cartridge</a>, the <a href="7.92%C3%9733mm%20Kurz">7.92×33mm Kurz</a>, and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a rifle. On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the <a href="People%27s%20Commissariat%20of%20Arms%20of%20the%20USSR">People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR</a>. The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own, to replace the <a href="PPSh-41">PPSh-41</a> submachine guns and outdated <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army.

The Soviets soon developed the <a href="7.62%C3%9739mm">7.62×39mm M43 cartridge</a>, the semi-automatic <a href="SKS">SKS carbine</a> and the <a href="RPD%20machine%20gun">RPD light machine gun</a>. Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47 assault rifle, which would quickly replace the SKS in Soviet service. In the 1960s, the Soviets introduced the <a href="RPK">RPK</a> light machine gun, an AK-47 type weapon with a stronger receiver, a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, that would eventually replace the RPD light machine gun.

<a href="Mikhail%20Kalashnikov">Mikhail Kalashnikov</a> began his career as a weapon designer in 1941, while recuperating from a shoulder wound, which he received during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bryansk">Battle of Bryansk</a>. Kalashnikov himself stated..."I was in the hospital, and a soldier in the bed beside me asked: ‘Why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two or three of our men, when the Germans have automatics?’ So I designed one. I was a soldier, and I created a machine gun for a soldier. It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova, the automatic weapon of Kalashnikov—AK—and it carried the date of its first manufacture, 1947."

The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations. "Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG44." Kalashnikov's team had access to these weapons and had no need to "reinvent the wheel". Kalashnikov himself observed: "A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so."

There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like Bulkin's TKB-415 or Simonov's AVS-31.

Kalashnikov started work on a submachine gun design in 1942 and with a light machine gun in 1943. "Early in 1944, Kalashnikov was given some M1943 7.62×39mm cartridges and informed that there were several designers working on weapons for this new Soviet small-arms cartridge. It was suggested to him that this new weapon might well lead to greater things, and he undertook work on the new rifle." In 1944, he entered a design competition with this new 7.62×39mm, semi-automatic, gas-operated, long stroke piston, carbine, strongly influenced by the American <a href="M1%20Garand">M1 Garand</a>. "The rifle that Kalashnikov designed was in the same class as the familiar <a href="SKS-45">SKS-45</a> Simonov with fixed magazine and gas tube above the barrel." However, this new Kalashnikov design lost out to a Simonov design.

In 1946, a new design competition was initiated to develop a new assault rifle. Kalashnikov submitted an entry. It was gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel, a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine, and a curved 30-round magazine. Kalashnikov's rifles AK-1 (with a milled <a href="receiver%20%28firearms%29">receiver</a>) and AK-2 (with a stamped receiver) proved to be reliable weapons and were accepted to a second round of competition along with other designs.

These prototypes (also known as the AK-46) had a rotary bolt, a two-part receiver with separate trigger unit housing, dual controls (separate safety and fire selector switches) and a non-reciprocating charging handle located on the left side of the weapon. This design had many similarities to the STG 44. In late 1946, as the rifles were being tested, one of Kalashnikov's assistants, Aleksandr Zaitsev, suggested a major redesign to improve reliability. At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaitsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov.

In November 1947, the new prototypes (AK-47s) were completed. It utilized a long-stroke gas piston above the barrel. The upper and lower receivers were combined into a single receiver. The selector and safety were combined into a single control-lever/dust-cover on the right side of the rifle. And, the bolt-handle was simply attached to the bolt-carrier. This simplified the design and production of the rifle. The first army trial series began in early 1948. The new rifle proved to be reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics. In 1949, it was adopted by the Soviet Army as "7.62 mm Kalashnikov assault rifle (AK)".

There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal <a href="receiver%20%28firearms%29">receivers</a> with a milled trunnion and butt stock insert, and a stamped body. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates. Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim <a href="SKS">SKS</a> rifle continued.

Once the manufacturing difficulties of non milled receivers had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the <a href="AKM">AKM</a> (M for "modernized" or "upgraded"; in Russian: "Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy])" was introduced in 1959. This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted <a href="muzzle%20brake">muzzle brake</a> on the end of the <a href="gun%20barrel">barrel</a> to compensate for <a href="muzzle%20rise">muzzle rise</a> under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or fully automatic fire. This is also sometimes referred to as a "cyclic rate reducer", or simply "rate reducer", as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during fully automatic fire. It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model.

Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types. In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the "Kalashnikov" or "AK". The differences between the milled and stamped receivers includes the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine.

In 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the <a href="AK-74">AK-74</a>, which uses <a href="5.45%C3%9739mm">5.45×39mm</a> ammunition. This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the <a href="Collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union collapsed</a>, drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc.

The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s. The AK-47 uses a <a href="Gas-operated%20reloading%23Long-stroke%20piston">long stroke gas system</a> that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions. The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle.

The AK fires the 7.62×39mm <a href="cartridge%20%28weaponry%29">cartridge</a> with a muzzle velocity of .
The cartridge weight is , the projectile weight is . The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain <a href="boat-tail%20bullet">boat-tail bullet</a>s with a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, and some lead between the core and the jacket. The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62×39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone. The 7.62×39mm round produces significant wounding in cases where the bullet tumbles (yaws) in tissue, but produces relatively minor wounds in cases where the bullet exits before beginning to yaw. In the absence of yaw, the M43 round can pencil through tissue with relatively little injury.

Most, if not all, of the 7.62×39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about , nearly earlier in tissue than the M43 round. This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~ for the newer M67 round versus ~ for the older M43 round. However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws.

To fire, the operator inserts a loaded <a href="Magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazine</a>, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the <a href="Trigger%20%28firearms%29">trigger</a>. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. In fully automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. After ignition of the cartridge primer and propellant, rapidly expanding propellant gases are diverted into the gas cylinder above the barrel through a vent near the muzzle. The build-up of gases inside the gas cylinder drives the long-stroke piston and <a href="Bolt%20%28firearm%29">bolt</a> carrier rearward and a cam guide machined into the underside of the bolt carrier along with an ejector spur on the bolt carrier rail guide, rotates the bolt approximately 35° and unlocks it from the barrel extension via a camming pin on the bolt. The moving assembly has about of free travel, which creates a delay between the initial recoil impulse of the piston and the bolt unlocking sequence, allowing gas pressures to drop to a safe level before the seal between the chamber and the bolt is broken. The AK-47 does not have a gas valve; excess gases are ventilated through a series of radial ports in the gas cylinder. The Kalashnikov operating system offers no primary extraction upon bolt rotation, but uses an extractor claw to eject the spent cartridge case.

The rifle received a barrel with a <a href="Chrome%20plating">chrome-lined</a> bore and four right-hand grooves at a 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The gas block contains a gas channel that is installed at a slanted angle in relation to the bore axis. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a <a href="muzzle%20brake">muzzle brake</a> or a <a href="blank-firing%20adaptor">blank-firing adaptor</a>.

The gas block of the AK-47 features a cleaning rod capture or sling loop. Gas relief ports that alleviate gas pressure are placed horizontally in a row on the gas cylinder.

The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe. It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and has 3 settings: safe (up), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (down). The reason for this is that under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto. To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever. To operate the fire selector lever, right handed shooters have to briefly remove their right hand from the pistol grip, which is ergonomically sub-optimal. Some AK-type rifles also have a more traditional selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip. This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (backward).

The AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent <a href="iron%20sight">iron sight</a> calibrated in increments from . The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment requires a special drift tool and is done by the armory before issue or if the need arises by an armorer after issue. The sight line elements are approximately over the bore axis. The "<a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a>" battle zero setting ""П"" on the 7.62×39mm AK-47 rear tangent sight element corresponds to a zero. These settings mirror the <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> and <a href="SKS">SKS</a> rifles, which the AK-47 replaced. For the AK-47 combined with service cartridges, the 300 m battle zero setting limits the <a href="External%20ballistics%23Bullet%20drop">apparent "bullet rise"</a> within approximately relative to the line of sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle, according to Russian and former Soviet doctrine) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at , for improved night fighting.

The AK-47 was originally equipped with a buttstock, handguard and an upper heat guard made from solid wood. With the introduction of the Type 3 receiver the buttstock, lower handguard and upper heatguard were manufactured from <a href="birch">birch</a> <a href="plywood">plywood</a> <a href="laminates">laminates</a>. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. AKS and AKMS models featured a downward-folding metal butt-stock similar to that of the German <a href="MP40">MP40 submachine-gun</a>, for use in the restricted space in the <a href="BMP%20development">BMP infantry combat vehicle</a>, as well as by paratroops. All 100 series AKs use plastic furniture with side-folding stocks.

The standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds. There are also 10, 20, and 40-round box magazines, as well as 75-round <a href="drum%20magazine">drum</a> magazines.

The AK-47's standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with "feed-lips" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that "Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers". This contributes to the AK-47 magazine being more reliable, but makes it heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines.

The early slab-sided steel AK-47 30-round detachable box magazines had sheet-metal bodies and weigh empty. The later steel AKM 30-round magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing empty. To further reduce weight, a light weight magazine with an aluminum body with a prominent reinforcing waffle rib pattern weighing empty was developed for the AKM that proved to be too fragile and the small issued amount of these magazines were quickly withdrawn from service. As a replacement steel-reinforced 30-round plastic 7.62×39mm box magazines were introduced. These <a href="Rust%20%28color%29">rust-colored</a> magazines weigh empty and are often mistakenly identified as being made of <a href="Bakelite">Bakelite</a> (a <a href="phenolic%20resin">phenolic resin</a>), but were actually fabricated from two-parts of AG-S4 molding compound (a <a href="glass-filled%20polymer">glass-reinforced</a> phenol-formaldehyde binder impregnated composite), assembled using an <a href="epoxy%20resin">epoxy resin</a> adhesive. Noted for their durability, these magazines did however compromise the rifle's camouflage and lacked the small horizontal reinforcing ribs running down both sides of the magazine body near the front that were added on all later plastic magazine generations. A second generation steel-reinforced dark-brown (color shades vary from <a href="maroon">maroon</a> to <a href="Plum%20%28color%29">plum</a> to near <a href="black">black</a>) 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine was introduced in the early 1980s, fabricated from <a href="Acrylonitrile%20butadiene%20styrene">ABS</a> plastic. The third generation steel-reinforced 30-round 7.62×39mm magazine is similar to the second generation, but is darker colored and has a matte nonreflective surface finish. The current issue steel-reinforced matte true black nonreflective surface finished 7.62×39mm 30-round magazines, fabricated from ABS plastic weigh empty.

Early steel AK-47 magazines are long; the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic 7.62×39mm magazines are about shorter.

The transition from steel to mainly plastic magazines yields a significant weight reduction and allows a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight.

All 7.62×39mm AK magazines are backwards compatible with older AK variants.

10.12 kg (22.3 lb) is the maximum amount of ammo that the average soldier can comfortably carry. It also allows for best comparison of the three most common 7.62×39mm AK magazines.

Most Yugoslavian and some East German AK magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty; however, most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty.

Accessories supplied with the rifle include a long 6H3 <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> featuring a long spear point blade. The AK-47 bayonet is installed by slipping the diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base.

All current model AKM rifles can mount under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers such as the <a href="GP-25">GP-25</a> and its variants, which can fire up to 20 rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to 400 metres. The main grenade is the VOG-25 (VOG-25M) fragmentation grenade which has a 6 m (9 m) (20 ft (30 ft)) lethality radius. The VOG-25P/VOG-25PM ("jumping") variant explodes above the ground.

The AK-47 can also mount a (rarely used) <a href="Rifle%20grenade%23Cup-type">cup-type grenade launcher</a>, the <a href="Kalashnikov%20grenade%20launcher">Kalashnikov grenade launcher</a> that fires standard <a href="RGD-5">RGD-5</a> Soviet hand-grenades. The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters. This launcher can also be used to launch <a href="tear-gas">tear-gas</a> and <a href="riot%20control">riot control</a> grenades.

All current AKs (100 series) and some older models, have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices, such as the <a href="PSO-1">PSO-1 Optical Sniper Sight</a>. The side rails allow for the removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic. However, the 100 series side folding stocks cannot be folded with the optics mounted.

The AK-47 and its variants are made in dozens of countries, with "quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship." As a result, the AK-47 has a service/system life of approximately 6,000, to 10,000, to 15,000 rounds. The AK-47 was designed to be a cheap, simple, easy to manufacture assault rifle, perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items. As units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on "battlefield cannibalization" for resupply, it is actually more cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons.

The AK-47 has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds. However, "Every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage, it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit, some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon. Some parts of the AK-47 line are riveted together. Repairing these can be quite a hassle, since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced."



For the further developed AK models, see <a href="Kalashnikov%20rifle">Kalashnikov rifle</a>s.

<a href="Kalashnikov%20Concern">Kalashnikov Concern</a> (formerly Izhmash) has repeatedly claimed that the majority of foreign manufacturers are producing AK type rifles without proper <a href="license">licensing</a>.

The AK-47's accuracy has always been considered to be "good enough" to hit an adult male torso out to about , though even experts firing from prone or bench rest positions at this range were observed to have difficulty placing ten consecutive rounds on target. Later designs did not significantly improve its accuracy. An AK can fire a 10-shot group of at , and at The newer stamped-steel receiver <a href="AKM">AKM</a> models, while more rugged and less prone to metal fatigue, are actually less accurate than the forged/milled receivers of their predecessors: the milled AK-47s are capable of shooting groups at , whereas the stamped AKMs are capable of shooting groups at .

The best shooters are able to hit a man-sized target at within five shots (firing from prone or bench rest position) or ten shots (standing).

The following table represents the Russian method for determining accuracy and it is far more complex than Western methods. In the West, one fires a group of shots into the target and then simply measure the overall diameter of the group. The Russians on the other-hand, fire a group of shots into the target. They then draw two circles on the target. One for the maximum vertical dispersion of hits and one for the maximum horizontal dispersion of hits. They then disregard the hits on the outer part of the target and only count half of the hits (50% or R) on the inner part of the circles. This dramatically reduces the overall diameter of the groups. They then use both the vertical and horizontal measurements of the reduced groups to measure accuracy. This method cannot be converted and is not comparable to western methods for determining accuracy.

In general, this is an improvement with respect to firing accuracy to the AK-47 and the AKM. The vertical and horizontal mean (R) deviations with service ammunition at for AK platforms are.
The single-shot hit-probability on the NATO E-type Silhouette Target (a human upper body half and head silhouette) of the AK-47 and the later developed AK-74, M16A1 and M16A2 assault rifles were measured by the US military under ideal proving ground conditions in the 1980s as follows:

Under worst field exercise circumstances, due to range estimation and aiming errors, the hit probabilities for the tested assault rifles were drastically reduced with differences without operational significance.

Throughout the world, the AK and its variants are commonly used by governments, revolutionaries, terrorists, criminals, and civilians alike. In some countries, such as Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Congo and Tanzania, the prices for Black Market AKs are between $30 and $125 per weapon and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting. In Kenya, "an AK-47 fetches five head of cattle (about 10,000 Kenya shillings or 100 U.S. dollars) when offered for barter, but costs almost half that price when cash is paid". There are places around the world where AK type weapons can be purchased on the <a href="Black%20Market">Black Market</a> "for as little as $6, or traded for a chicken or a sack of grain".

The AK-47 has also spawned a cottage industry of sorts and has been copied and manufactured (one gun at a time) in small shops around the world (see <a href="Khyber%20Pass%20Copy">Khyber Pass Copy</a>). The estimated numbers of AK-type weapons vary greatly. The Small Arms Survey suggest that "between 70 and 100 million of these weapons have been produced since 1947". The World Bank estimates that out of the 500 million total firearms available worldwide, 100 million are of the Kalashnikov family, and 75 million are AK-47s. Because AK-type weapons have been made in many countries, often illicitly, it is impossible to know how many really exist.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as United States and other NATO nations supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces around the world. During this time the Western countries used relatively expensive automatic rifles, such as the <a href="FN%20FAL">FN FAL</a>, the <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20G3">HK G3</a>, the <a href="M14%20rifle">M14</a>, and the <a href="M16%20rifle">M16</a>. In contrast, the Russians and Chinese used the AK-47; its low production cost and ease of manufacture allow them to make AKs in vast numbers.

In the pro-communist states, the AK-47 became a symbol of third-world revolution. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by Western nations, including Middle Eastern nations such as Iran, Libya, and Syria, which welcomed Soviet Union backing against Israel. After the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">fall of the Soviet Union</a>, AK-47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash, including drug cartels and dictatorial states, and more recently they have been seen in the hands of Islamic groups such as <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a>, <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a>, and the <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> in Afghanistan and Iraq, and <a href="FARC">FARC</a>, <a href="Ej%C3%A9rcito%20de%20Liberaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional">Ejército de Liberación Nacional</a> guerrillas in Colombia.

In Russia, the Kalashnikov is a tremendous source of national pride. "The family of the inventor of the world's most famous assault rifle, Mikhail Kalashnikov, has authorized German engineering company MMI to use the well-known Kalashnikov name on a variety of not-so-deadly goods." In recent years, Kalashnikov Vodka has been marketed with souvenir bottles in the shape of the AK-47 Kalashnikov. There are also Kalashnikov watches, umbrellas, and knives.

The Kalashnikov Museum (also called the AK-47 museum) opened on 4 November 2004 in <a href="Izhevsk">Izhevsk</a>, Udmurt Republic. This city is in the <a href="Ural%20Region">Ural Region</a> of Russia. The museum chronicles the biography of General <a href="Mikhail%20Kalashnikov">Kalashnikov</a> and documents the invention of the AK-47. The museum complex of Kalashnikov's small arms, a series of halls, and multimedia exhibitions are devoted to the evolution of the AK-47 assault rifle and attracts 10,000 monthly visitors. Nadezhda Vechtomova, the museum director, stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to "separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country". On 19 September 2017 a monument of Kalashnikov was unveiled in central Moscow. A protester, later detained by police, attempted to unfurl a banner reading "a creator of weapons is a creator of death".

The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the <a href="flag%20of%20Mozambique">flag of Mozambique</a> and its <a href="Emblem%20of%20Mozambique">emblem</a>, an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their AK-47s. It is also found in the coats of arms of <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20East%20Timor">East Timor</a> and the revolution era <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, as well as in the flags of <a href="flag%20of%20Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a>, <a href="Syrian%20Resistance">Syrian Resistance</a>, <a href="FARC-EP">FARC-EP</a>, the <a href="New%20People%27s%20Army">New People's Army</a>, <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Turkey/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist">TKP/TIKKO</a> and the <a href="International%20Revolutionary%20People%27s%20Guerrilla%20Forces">International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces</a>.

Some Western countries associate the AK-47 with their enemies; both Cold War era and present-day. For example, Western movies often portray criminals, gang members and terrorists using AK-47s. For these reasons, in the U.S. and Western Europe, the AK-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents, gangsters and terrorists. Conversely, throughout the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>, the AK-47 can be positively attributed with <a href="revolutionaries">revolutionaries</a> against foreign occupation, <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>, or <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a>.

The AK-47 made an appearance in U.S. popular culture as a recurring focus in the <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a> film "<a href="Lord%20of%20War">Lord of War</a>" (2005). Numerous monologues in the movie focus on the weapon, and its effects on global conflict and the <a href="gun%20running">gun running</a> market.

In 2006, the Colombian musician and peace activist <a href="Cesar%20Lopez">César López</a> devised the "<a href="escopetarra">escopetarra</a>", an AK converted into a guitar. One sold for US$17,000 in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of <a href="anti-personnel%20mine">anti-personnel mine</a>s, while another was exhibited at the United Nations' <a href="Conference%20on%20Disarmament">Conference on Disarmament</a>.

In Mexico, the AK-47 is known as "Cuerno de Chivo" (literally "Goat's Horn") because of its curved magazine design. It is one of the weapons of choice of Mexican drug cartels. It is sometimes mentioned in Mexican folk music lyrics.

Atanasoff–Berry computer

The Atanasoff–Berry computer (ABC) was the first automatic electronic digital computer, an early <a href="electronics">electronic</a> <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a> <a href="computing">computing</a> device that has remained somewhat obscure. The ABC's priority is debated among historians of computer technology, because it was neither <a href="Computer%20program">programmable</a>, nor <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a>.

Conceived in 1937, the machine was built by <a href="Iowa%20State%20University">Iowa State College</a> mathematics and physics professor <a href="John%20Vincent%20Atanasoff">John Vincent Atanasoff</a> with the help of graduate student <a href="Clifford%20Berry">Clifford Berry</a>. It was designed only to solve systems of <a href="linear%20equation">linear equation</a>s and was successfully tested in 1942. However, its intermediate result storage mechanism, a paper card writer/reader, was not perfected, and when John Vincent Atanasoff left Iowa State College for World War II assignments, work on the machine was discontinued. The ABC pioneered important elements of modern computing, including <a href="binary%20arithmetic">binary arithmetic</a> and <a href="Electronics">electronic switching</a> elements, but its special-purpose nature and lack of a changeable, <a href="stored%20program">stored program</a> distinguish it from modern computers. The computer was designated an <a href="List%20of%20IEEE%20milestones">IEEE Milestone</a> in 1990.

Atanasoff and Berry's computer work was not widely known until it was rediscovered in the 1960s, amidst conflicting claims about the first instance of an electronic computer. At that time <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, that had been created by <a href="John%20Mauchly">John Mauchly</a> and <a href="J.%20Presper%20Eckert">J. Presper Eckert</a>, was considered to be the first computer in the modern sense, but in 1973 a U.S. District Court invalidated the ENIAC patent and concluded that the ENIAC inventors had derived the subject matter of the electronic digital computer from Atanasoff (see <a href="%23Patent%20dispute">Patent dispute</a>). When, in the mid-1970s, the secrecy surrounding the British World War II development of the <a href="Colossus%20computer">Colossus computer</a>s that pre-dated ENIAC, was lifted and Colossus was described at a conference in <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a> in June 1976, John Mauchly and <a href="Konrad%20Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a> were reported to have been astonished.

According to Atanasoff's account, several key principles of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer were conceived in a sudden insight after a long nighttime drive to <a href="Rock%20Island%2C%20Illinois">Rock Island, Illinois</a>, during the winter of 1937–38. The ABC innovations included electronic computation, binary arithmetic, <a href="Parallel%20computing">parallel processing</a>, regenerative capacitor memory, and a separation of memory and computing functions. The mechanical and logic design was worked out by Atanasoff over the next year. A grant application to build a <a href="proof%20of%20concept">proof of concept</a> prototype was submitted in March 1939 to the <a href="Agronomy">Agronomy</a> department which was also interested in speeding up computation for economic and research analysis. $5,000 of further funding () to complete the machine came from the nonprofit <a href="Research%20Corporation">Research Corporation</a> of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

The ABC was built by Atanasoff and Berry in the basement of the physics building at <a href="Iowa%20State%20College">Iowa State College</a> during 1939–42. The initial funds were released in September, and the 11-tube prototype was first demonstrated in October 1939. A December demonstration prompted a grant for construction of the full-scale machine. The ABC was built and tested over the next two years. A January 15, 1941 story in the "<a href="Des%20Moines%20Register">Des Moines Register</a>" announced the ABC as "an electrical computing machine" with more than 300 vacuum tubes that would "compute complicated algebraic equations" (but gave no precise technical description of the computer). The system weighed more than . It contained approximately of wire, 280 dual-triode <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s, 31 <a href="thyratron">thyratron</a>s, and was about the size of a desk.

It was not a <a href="Turing%20complete">Turing complete</a> computer, which distinguishes it from more general machines, like contemporary <a href="Konrad%20Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a>'s <a href="Z3%20%28computer%29">Z3</a> (1941), or later machines like the 1946 <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, the 1949 <a href="EDVAC">EDVAC</a>, the <a href="Manchester%20computers">University of Manchester</a> designs, or <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>'s post-War design of <a href="Automatic%20Computing%20Engine">ACE</a> at <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">NPL</a> and elsewhere. Nor did it implement the <a href="stored%20program%20architecture">stored program architecture</a> that made practical fully general-purpose, reprogrammable computers.

The machine was, however, the first to implement three critical ideas that are still part of every modern computer:

The memory of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was a system called "regenerative capacitor memory", which consisted of a pair of drums, each containing 1600 <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s that rotated on a common shaft once per second. The capacitors on each drum were organized into 32 "bands" of 50 (30 active bands and two spares in case a capacitor failed), giving the machine a speed of 30 additions/subtractions per second. Data was represented as 50-bit binary <a href="Fixed-point%20arithmetic">fixed-point</a> numbers. The electronics of the memory and arithmetic units could store and operate on 60 such numbers at a time (3000 bits).

The <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> <a href="utility%20frequency">power line frequency</a> of 60 Hz was the primary clock rate for the lowest-level operations.

The <a href="arithmetic%20logic%20unit">arithmetic logic functions</a> were fully electronic, implemented with vacuum tubes. The family of <a href="logic%20gate">logic gate</a>s ranged from inverters to two and three input gates. The input and output levels and operating voltages were compatible between the different gates. Each gate consisted of one inverting vacuum tube amplifier, preceded by a resistor divider input network that defined the logical function. The control logic functions, which only needed to operate once per drum rotation and therefore did not require electronic speed, were electromechanical, implemented with <a href="relay">relay</a>s.

Although the Atanasoff–Berry Computer was an important step up from earlier calculating machines, it was not able to run entirely automatically through an entire problem. An operator was needed to operate the control switches to set up its functions, much like the electro-mechanical calculators and <a href="unit%20record%20equipment">unit record equipment</a> of the time. Selection of the operation to be performed, reading, writing, converting to or from binary to decimal, or reducing a set of equations was made by front panel switches and in some cases jumpers.

There were two forms of input and output: primary user input and output and an intermediate results output and input. The intermediate results storage allowed operation on problems too large to be handled entirely within the electronic memory. (The largest problem that could be solved without the use of the intermediate output and input was two <a href="simultaneous%20equations">simultaneous equations</a>, a trivial problem.)

Intermediate results were binary, written onto paper sheets by electrostatically modifying the resistance at 1500 locations to represent 30 of the 50-bit numbers (one equation). Each sheet could be written or read in one second. The reliability of the system was limited to about 1 error in 100,000 calculations by these units, primarily attributed to lack of control of the sheets' material characteristics. In retrospect a solution could have been to add a parity bit to each number as written. This problem was not solved by the time Atanasoff left the university for war-related work.

Primary user input was decimal, via standard <a href="IBM">IBM</a> 80-column <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s and output was decimal, via a front panel display.

The ABC was designed for a specific purpose, the solution of systems of simultaneous linear equations. It could handle systems with up to twenty-nine equations, a difficult problem for the time. Problems of this scale were becoming common in physics, the department in which John Atanasoff worked. The machine could be fed two linear equations with up to twenty-nine variables and a constant term and eliminate one of the variables. This process would be repeated manually for each of the equations, which would result in a system of equations with one fewer variable. Then the whole process would be repeated to eliminate another variable.

<a href="George%20W.%20Snedecor">George W. Snedecor</a>, the head of Iowa State's Statistics Department, was very likely the first user of an electronic digital computer to solve real world mathematics problems. He submitted many of these problems to Atanasoff.

On June 26, 1947, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly were the first to file for patent on a digital computing device (ENIAC), much to the surprise of Atanasoff. The ABC had been examined by John Mauchly in June 1941, and Isaac Auerbach, a former student of Mauchly's, alleged that it influenced his later work on ENIAC, although Mauchly denied this (Shurkin, pg. 280-299). The ENIAC patent did not issue until 1964, and by 1967 <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> sued Sperry Rand in an attempt to break the ENIAC patents, arguing the ABC constituted <a href="prior%20art">prior art</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Minnesota">United States District Court for the District of Minnesota</a> released its judgement on October 19, 1973, finding in "<a href="Honeywell%20v.%20Sperry%20Rand">Honeywell v. Sperry Rand</a>" that the ENIAC patent was a derivative of John Atanasoff's invention.

Campbell-Kelly and Aspray conclude:
The case was legally resolved on October 19, 1973 when U.S. District Judge Earl R. Larson held the ENIAC patent invalid, ruling that the ENIAC derived many basic ideas from the Atanasoff–Berry Computer. Judge Larson explicitly stated,
<a href="Herman%20Goldstine">Herman Goldstine</a>, one of the original developers of ENIAC wrote:

The original ABC was eventually dismantled, when the University converted the basement to classrooms, and all of its pieces except for one memory drum were discarded.

In 1997, a team of researchers led by <a href="John%20Gustafson%20%28scientist%29">John Gustafson</a> from <a href="Ames%20Laboratory">Ames Laboratory</a> (located on the Iowa State campus) finished building a working replica of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer at a cost of $350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). The replica ABC is now on permanent display in the first floor lobby of the Durham Center for Computation and Communication at Iowa State University. As of May 2012, it is on loan to the <a href="Computer%20History%20Museum">Computer History Museum</a> in <a href="Mountain%20View%2C%20California">Mountain View, California</a> for a major exhibition.

Andes

The Andes or Andean Mountains () are the <a href="List%20of%20mountain%20ranges%23By%20length">longest</a> <a href="continental%20crust">continental</a> <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a> in the world. They form a continuous highland along the western edge of <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. This range is about long, about wide (widest between <a href="18th%20parallel%20south">18° south</a> and <a href="20th%20parallel%20south">20° south</a> <a href="latitude">latitude</a>), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>.

Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, which are separated by intermediate <a href="depression%20%28geology%29">depression</a>s. The Andes are the location of several high <a href="plateau">plateau</a>s – some of which host major cities such as <a href="Quito">Quito</a>, <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, <a href="Arequipa">Arequipa</a>, <a href="Medell%C3%ADn">Medellín</a>, <a href="Sucre">Sucre</a>, <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20M%C3%A9rida">Mérida</a> and <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a>. The <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano plateau</a> is the world's second-highest after the <a href="Tibetan%20plateau">Tibetan plateau</a>. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the <a href="Tropical%20Andes">Tropical Andes</a>, the <a href="Dry%20Andes">Dry Andes</a>, and the <a href="Wet%20Andes">Wet Andes</a>.

The Andes are the world's highest mountain range outside of <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. The highest mountain outside Asia, Mount <a href="Aconcagua">Aconcagua</a>, rises to an elevation of about above sea level. The <a href="Summit%20%28topography%29">peak</a> of <a href="Chimborazo%20%28volcano%29">Chimborazo</a> in the Ecuadorean Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the <a href="equatorial%20bulge">equatorial bulge</a> resulting from the <a href="Earth%27s%20rotation">Earth's rotation</a>. The world's highest <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es are in the Andes, including <a href="Ojos%20del%20Salado">Ojos del Salado</a> on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to .

The Andes are also part of the <a href="American%20Cordillera">American Cordillera</a>, a chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western "backbone" of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.

The etymology of the word "Andes" has been debated. The majority consensus is that it derives from the <a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua</a> word "anti", which means "east" as in "<a href="Antisuyu">Antisuyu</a>" (Quechua for "east region"), one of the four regions of the <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca Empire</a>.

The Andes can be divided into three sections:

In the northern part of the Andes, the isolated <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20de%20Santa%20Marta">Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta</a> range is often considered to be part of the Andes. The term "cordillera" comes from the Spanish word "cordel", meaning "rope". The Andes range is about wide throughout its length, except in the <a href="Orocline">Bolivian flexure</a> where it is about wide. The <a href="Leeward%20Antilles">Leeward Antilles</a> islands <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a>, <a href="Bonaire">Bonaire</a>, and <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, which lie in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> off the coast of Venezuela, were thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South American and Caribbean plates.

The Andes are a <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>–<a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> <a href="orogenic">orogenic</a> belt of mountains along the <a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>, a zone of <a href="volcanic%20activity">volcanic activity</a> that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the <a href="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> region. The Andes are the result of <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> processes, caused by the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of <a href="oceanic%20crust">oceanic crust</a> beneath the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a>. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of the western rim of the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> due to the subduction of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> and the <a href="Antarctic%20Plate">Antarctic Plate</a>. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several <a href="sedimentary%20basin">sedimentary basin</a>s, such as <a href="Orinoco">Orinoco</a>, <a href="Amazon%20Basin">Amazon Basin</a>, <a href="Madre%20de%20Dios%20River">Madre de Dios</a> and <a href="Gran%20Chaco">Gran Chaco</a>, that separate the Andes from the ancient <a href="craton">craton</a>s in eastern South America. In the south, the Andes share a long boundary with the former <a href="Patagonia%23Geology">Patagonia Terrane</a>. To the west, the Andes end at the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, although the <a href="Peru-Chile%20trench">Peru-Chile trench</a> can be considered their ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach, the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography. The Andes Mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range.

The Andean orogen has a series of bends or <a href="orocline">orocline</a>s. The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and the Andes Mountains at about 18° S. At this point the orientation of the Andes turns from Northwest in <a href="Peru">Peru</a> to South in <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The Andean segment north and south of the orocline have been rotated 15° to 20° counter clockwise and clockwise respectively. The Bolivian Orocline area overlaps with the area of maximum width of the <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano Plateau</a> and according to Isacks (1988) the orocline is related to <a href="crustal%20shortening">crustal shortening</a>. The specific point at 18° S where the coastline bends is known as the "Arica Elbow". Further south lies the Maipo Orocline or Maipo Transition Zone located between 30° S and 38°S with a break in trend at 33° S. Near the southern tip of the Andes lies the Patagonian orocline.

The western rim of the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> has been the place of several pre-Andean <a href="orogeny">orogenies</a> since at least the late <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a> and early <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>, when several <a href="terrane">terrane</a>s and <a href="microcontinent">microcontinent</a>s collided and amalgamated with the ancient <a href="craton">craton</a>s of eastern South America, by then the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American part</a> of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>.

The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> when <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a> began to break up that resulted in developing several <a href="rift">rift</a>s. The development continued through the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> Period. It was during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the <a href="Tectonic%20uplift">uplifting</a>, <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a> and <a href="Fold%20%28geology%29">folding</a> of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> and <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic</a> rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant, where different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and <a href="erosion">erosion</a>.

Tectonic forces above the <a href="subduction%20zone">subduction zone</a> along the entire west coast of South America where the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> and a part of the <a href="Antarctic%20Plate">Antarctic Plate</a> are sliding beneath the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> continue to produce an ongoing <a href="Orogeny">orogenic event</a> resulting in minor to major <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s and <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a>s to this day. In the extreme south a major <a href="transform%20fault">transform fault</a> separates <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> from the small <a href="Scotia%20Plate">Scotia Plate</a>. Across the wide <a href="Drake%20Passage">Drake Passage</a> lie the mountains of the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a> south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain. 

The regions immediately east of the Andes experience a series of changes resulting from the Andean orogeny. Parts of the <a href="Suns%C3%A1s%20orogeny">Sunsás Orogen</a> in <a href="Amazonian%20craton">Amazonian craton</a> disappeared from the surface of earth being <a href="thrust%20fault">overridden</a> by the Andes.
The <a href="Sierras%20de%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Sierras de Córdoba</a>, where the effects of the ancient <a href="Pampean%20orogeny">Pampean orogeny</a> can be observed, owe their modern uplift and relief to the <a href="Andean%20orogeny">Andean orogeny</a> in the <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a>. Further south in southern <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> the onset of the Andean orogeny caused the <a href="Magallanes%20Basin">Magallanes Basin</a> to evolve from being an <a href="extensional%20tectonics">extensional</a> <a href="back-arc%20basin">back-arc basin</a> in the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> to being a compressional <a href="Andean%20Foreland%20Basin">foreland basin</a> in the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>.

The Andes range has many active volcanoes, which are distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for <a href="calc-alkalic">calc-alkalic</a> and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of <a href="mid-ocean%20ridge">mid-ocean ridge</a>s and <a href="seamount">seamount</a> chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and <a href="magma">magma</a> ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.

The Andes Mountains host large <a href="ore">ore</a> and <a href="salt">salt</a> deposits and some of their eastern <a href="fold%20and%20thrust%20belt">fold and thrust belt</a> acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s. In the forelands of the <a href="Atacama%20desert">Atacama desert</a> some of the largest <a href="porphyry%20copper">porphyry copper</a> mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the first and second largest exporters of <a href="copper">copper</a> in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by <a href="hydrothermal%20fluid">hydrothermal fluid</a>s (mostly water) during the cooling of <a href="pluton%20%28geology%29">pluton</a>s or volcanic systems. The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of <a href="meteoric%20water">meteoric water</a>. The dry climate in the central western Andes has also led to the creation of extensive <a href="Chile%20saltpeter">saltpeter deposits</a> which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the <a href="Dry%20lake">salars</a> of <a href="Salar%20de%20Atacama">Atacama</a> and <a href="Salar%20de%20Uyuni">Uyuni</a>, the first one being the largest source of <a href="lithium">lithium</a> today and the second the world's largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> plutonism in Bolivia's Cordillera Central created the Bolivian <a href="tin">tin</a> belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of <a href="Cerro%20Rico">Cerro Rico de Potosí</a>.

The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central section is dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. <a href="Rainforest">Rainforest</a>s exist just miles away from the snow-covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The <a href="snow%20line">snow line</a> depends on the location. It is at between in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S, then descending to on Aconcagua at 32°S, at 40°S, at 50°S, and only in <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> at 55°S; from 50°S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.

The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones; the <a href="Dry%20Andes">Dry Andes</a> and the <a href="Wet%20Andes">Wet Andes</a>. Since the Dry Andes extend from the latitudes of <a href="Atacama%20Desert">Atacama Desert</a> to the area of <a href="Maule%20River">Maule River</a>, precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the <a href="ablation">ablation</a> area or in the <a href="Glacier%20ice%20accumulation">accumulation area</a>.

In the high Andes of central Chile and <a href="Mendoza%20Province">Mendoza Province</a>, <a href="rock%20glacier">rock glacier</a>s are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a>.

Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly 7000 m towering highest mountains of the Andes. This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32–34° S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers do not even reach 10 km in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness. At glacial times, however, c. 20 000 years ago, the glaciers were over ten times longer. On the east side of this section of the Mendozina Andes they flowed down to 2060 m and on the west side to c. 1220 m asl. The massifs of Cerro Aconcagua (6,961 m), Cerro Tupungato (6,550 m) and Nevado Juncal (6,110 m) are tens of kilometres away from each other and were connected by a joint ice stream network. The Andes' dendritic glacier arms, i.e. components of valley glaciers, were up to 112.5 km long, over 1020, i.e. 1250 m thick and overspanned a vertical distance of 5150 altitude metres. The climatic glacier snowline (ELA) was lowered from currently 4600 m to 3200 m at glacial times.

The Andean region cuts across several <a href="natural%20region">natural</a> and floristic regions due to its extension from <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> Venezuela to cold, windy and wet <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> passing through the hyperarid Atacama Desert. <a href="Rainforest">Rainforest</a>s and <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry%20broadleaf%20forests">tropical dry forests</a> used to encircle much of the northern Andes but are now greatly <a href="Deforestation">diminished</a>, especially in the <a href="El%20Choc%C3%B3">Chocó</a> and inter-Andean valleys of Colombia. As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several <a href="Interandean%20Valles">Interandean Valles</a>, they are typically dominated by <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> woodland, shrub and <a href="xeric">xeric</a> vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Atacama Desert.

About 30,000 species of <a href="vascular%20plants">vascular plants</a> live in the Andes, with roughly half being <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other <a href="Biodiversity%20hotspot">hotspot</a>. The small tree "<a href="Cinchona%20pubescens">Cinchona pubescens</a>", a source of <a href="quinine">quinine</a> which is used to treat <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> and <a href="potato">potato</a>es. The high-altitude "<a href="Polylepis">Polylepis</a>" forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queñua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the <a href="Inca">Inca</a>n period. Regardless, in <a href="modern%20history">modern times</a> the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly <a href="endangered">endangered</a>, with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.

The Andes are rich in fauna: With almost 3,500 species, of which roughly 2/3 are <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the region, the Andes are the most important region in the world for <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s.
The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of <a href="reptile">reptile</a> (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (about 1/3 endemic).

The <a href="vicu%C3%B1a">vicuña</a> and <a href="guanaco">guanaco</a> can be found living in the <a href="Altiplano">Altiplano</a>, while the closely related <a href="Domestication">domesticated</a> <a href="llama">llama</a> and <a href="alpaca">alpaca</a> are widely kept by locals as <a href="pack%20animal">pack animal</a>s and for their <a href="meat">meat</a> and <a href="wool">wool</a>. The crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) <a href="chinchilla">chinchilla</a>s, two threatened members of the <a href="rodent">rodent</a> order, inhabit the Andes' alpine regions. The <a href="Andean%20condor">Andean condor</a>, the largest bird of its kind in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities. Other animals found in the relatively open habitats of the high Andes include the <a href="Huemul%20%28zoology%29">huemul</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>, foxes in the genus "<a href="Pseudalopex">Pseudalopex</a>", and, for birds, certain species of <a href="tinamou">tinamou</a>s (notably members of the genus "<a href="Nothoprocta">Nothoprocta</a>"), <a href="Andean%20goose">Andean goose</a>, <a href="giant%20coot">giant coot</a>, <a href="flamingo">flamingo</a>s (mainly associated with <a href="hypersaline">hypersaline</a> lakes), <a href="lesser%20rhea">lesser rhea</a>, <a href="Andean%20flicker">Andean flicker</a>, <a href="diademed%20sandpiper-plover">diademed sandpiper-plover</a>, <a href="Geositta">miners</a>, <a href="Phrygilus">sierra-finches</a> and <a href="Diuca">diuca-finches</a>.

<a href="Lake%20Titicaca">Lake Titicaca</a> hosts several endemics, among them the highly endangered <a href="Titicaca%20flightless%20grebe">Titicaca flightless grebe</a> and <a href="Titicaca%20water%20frog">Titicaca water frog</a>. A few species of <a href="hummingbirds">hummingbirds</a>, notably some <a href="Oreotrochilus">hillstars</a>, can be seen at altitudes above , but far higher <a href="Species%20richness">diversities</a> can be found at lower altitudes, especially in the humid Andean forests ("<a href="cloud%20forest">cloud forest</a>s") growing on slopes in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and far northwestern Argentina. These forest-types, which includes the <a href="Yungas">Yungas</a> and parts of the Chocó, are very rich in flora and fauna, although few large mammals exist, exceptions being the threatened <a href="mountain%20tapir">mountain tapir</a>, <a href="spectacled%20bear">spectacled bear</a> and <a href="yellow-tailed%20woolly%20monkey">yellow-tailed woolly monkey</a>.

Birds of humid Andean forests include <a href="mountain-toucan">mountain-toucan</a>s, <a href="quetzal">quetzal</a>s and the <a href="Andean%20cock-of-the-rock">Andean cock-of-the-rock</a>, while <a href="mixed%20species%20flock">mixed species flock</a>s dominated by <a href="tanagers">tanagers</a> and <a href="furnariids">furnariids</a> commonly are seen – in contrast to several vocal but typically <a href="crypsis">cryptic</a> species of <a href="wrens">wrens</a>, <a href="tapaculo">tapaculo</a>s and <a href="antpitta">antpitta</a>s.

A number of species such as the <a href="royal%20cinclodes">royal cinclodes</a> and <a href="white-browed%20tit-spinetail">white-browed tit-spinetail</a> are associated with "Polylepis", and consequently also <a href="threatened">threatened</a>.

The Andes Mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the <a href="Inca%20civilization">Inca civilization</a> and <a href="Inca%20Empire">Inca Empire</a> in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through <a href="imperialist">imperialist</a>ic <a href="militarism">militarism</a> as well as careful and meticulous governmental management. The government sponsored the construction of <a href="Aqueduct%20%28watercourse%29">aqueducts</a> and <a href="roads">roads</a> in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.

Devastated by European diseases to which they had no <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> and civil wars, in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. <a href="Huancas">Huancas</a>, <a href="Chachapoyas%20culture">Chachapoyas</a>, <a href="Ca%C3%B1ari">Cañari</a>s) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by <a href="Francisco%20Pizarro">Francisco Pizarro</a>. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was <a href="Machu%20Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>, which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the <a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua</a> and <a href="Aymara%20language">Aymara language</a> families. <a href="Woodbine%20Parish">Woodbine Parish</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Barclay%20Pentland">Joseph Barclay Pentland</a> surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.

In modern times, the largest Andean cities are <a href="Bogot%C3%A1%2C%20Colombia">Bogotá, Colombia</a>, with a population of about eight million, <a href="Santiago%20de%20Chile">Santiago de Chile</a>, and <a href="Medellin%2C%20Colombia">Medellin, Colombia</a>. <a href="La%20Paz">La Paz</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia's</a> seat of government is considered the highest capital city in the world.

Several major cities are either in the Andes or in the foothills, among which are <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, <a href="Medell%C3%ADn">Medellín</a> and <a href="Cali%2C%20Colombia">Cali, Colombia</a>; <a href="Quito%2C%20Ecuador">Quito, Ecuador</a>; <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20M%C3%A9rida">Mérida, Venezuela</a>; <a href="La%20Paz%2C%20Bolivia">La Paz, Bolivia</a>; <a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile">Santiago, Chile</a>, and <a href="Lima">Lima</a> or <a href="Cusco%2C%20Peru">Cusco, Peru</a>. These and most other cities and large towns are connected with <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a <a href="four-wheel-drive">four-wheel-drive</a> vehicle.

The rough terrain has historically put the costs of building <a href="highway">highway</a>s and <a href="railroad">railroad</a>s that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern <a href="civil%20engineering">civil engineering</a> practices. For example, the main crossover of the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the <a href="Paso%20Internacional%20Los%20Libertadores">Paso Internacional Los Libertadores</a>. Only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected. Much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft.

However, there is one railroad that connects Chile with Argentina via the Andes, and there are others that make the same connection via southern Bolivia. See railroad maps of that region.

There is one or more highways in Bolivia that cross the Andes. Some of these were built during a period of war between Bolivia and <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, in order to transport Bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay.

For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> between Chile, the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Argentina out of the war. The <a href="Chilean%20Army">Chilean Army</a> and <a href="Chilean%20Navy">Chilean Navy</a> defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivia's only province on the Pacific Coast, some land from Peru that was returned to Peru decades later. Bolivia has been a completely <a href="landlocked">landlocked</a> country ever since. It mostly uses <a href="seaport">seaport</a>s in eastern Argentina and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978.

Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in the mountains—to which travel via <a href="motorized%20vehicle">motorized vehicle</a>s are of little use—are still located in the high Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, and <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>. Locally, the relatives of the <a href="camel">camel</a>, the <a href="llama">llama</a>, and the <a href="alpaca">alpaca</a> continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times. <a href="Donkey">Donkey</a>s, <a href="mule">mule</a>s, and horses are also useful.

The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, <a href="Terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terracing</a> has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The <a href="potato">potato</a> holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. <a href="Maize">Maize</a> was also an important crop for these people, and was used for the production of <a href="chicha">chicha</a>, important to Andean native people. Currently, <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>, <a href="cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="coffee">coffee</a> are the main export crops. <a href="Coca">Coca</a>, despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating <a href="herbal%20tea">herbal tea</a>, and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>.

In unirrigated land, <a href="pasture">pasture</a> is the most common type of land use. In the rainy season (summer), part of the rangeland is used for cropping (mainly potatoes, barley, broad beans and wheat).

Irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage. Also, by early sowing, maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains (till 3800 m). In addition it makes cropping in the dry season (winter) possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like <a href="onion">onion</a> and <a href="carrot">carrot</a>.

The Andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish conquest of South America</a>. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals the <a href="Mineralization%20%28geology%29">mineralization</a>s of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. <a href="Potos%C3%AD">Potosí</a> in present-day <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="Cerro%20de%20Pasco">Cerro de Pasco</a> in Peru were one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Río de la Plata</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> derive their names from the silver of Potosí.

Currently, mining in the Andes of <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a> places these countries as the first and third major producers of <a href="copper">copper</a> in the world. <a href="Peru">Peru</a> also contains the largest goldmine in the world: the <a href="Yanacocha">Yanacocha</a>. The Bolivian Andes produce principally <a href="tin">tin</a> although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the <a href="Price%20revolution">economy</a> of 17th century Europe.

There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish <a href="silver">silver</a> <a href="Mining">mine</a>s in <a href="Potos%C3%AD">Potosí</a> in the 16th century to the vast current <a href="porphyry%20copper%20deposit">porphyry copper deposit</a>s of <a href="Chuquicamata">Chuquicamata</a> and <a href="Escondida">Escondida</a> in Chile and <a href="Toquepala%20mine">Toquepala</a> in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are important.

This list contains some of the major peaks in the Andes mountain range. The highest peak is Aconcagua of Argentina (see below).

<doc id="1358" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1358" title="Anchor">
Anchor

An anchor is a device, normally made of metal, used to connect a <a href="Watercraft">vessel</a> to the <a href="Seabed">bed</a> of a body of water to prevent the craft from drifting due to <a href="Leeway">wind</a> or <a href="Ocean%20current">current</a>. The word derives from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ancora", which itself comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἄγκυρα ("ankura").

Anchors can either be temporary or permanent. Permanent anchors are used in the creation of a <a href="mooring%20%28watercraft%29%23Permanent%20anchor%20mooring">mooring</a>, and are rarely moved; a specialist service is normally needed to move or maintain them. Vessels carry one or more temporary anchors, which may be of different designs and weights.

A <a href="sea%20anchor">sea anchor</a> is a <a href="drogue">drogue</a>, not in contact with the seabed, used to control a drifting vessel.

Anchors achieve holding power either by "hooking" into the <a href="seabed">seabed</a>, via sheer mass, or a combination of the two. Permanent moorings use large masses (commonly a block or slab of concrete) resting on the seabed. Semi-permanent mooring anchors (such as <a href="%23Mushroom%20anchor">mushroom anchor</a>s) and large ship's anchors derive a significant portion of their holding power from their mass, while also hooking or embedding in the bottom. Modern anchors for smaller vessels have metal "flukes" which hook on to rocks on the bottom or bury themselves in soft seabed.

The vessel is attached to the anchor by the "rode" (commonly called the "anchor cable" or "anchor chain" in larger vessels), which is made of <a href="chain">chain</a>, <a href="Wire%20rope">cable</a>, <a href="rope">rope</a>, or a combination of these. The ratio of the length of rode to the water depth is known as the scope; generally, the rode should be between 5 and 10 times the depth of the seabed, giving a scope of 5:1 or 10:1; the larger the number, the shallower the angle is between the cable and the seafloor, and the less upwards force is acting on the anchor. A 10:1 scope gives the greatest holding power, but also allows for much more drifting due to the longer amount of cable paid out. Anchoring with sufficient scope and/or heavy chain rode brings the direction of strain close to parallel with the seabed. This is particularly important for light, modern anchors designed to bury in the bottom, where scopes of 5– to 7-to-1 are common, whereas heavy anchors and moorings can use a scope of 3-to-1, or less.

Since all anchors that embed themselves in the bottom require the strain to be along the seabed, anchors can be broken out of the bottom by shortening the rope until the vessel is directly above the anchor; at this point the anchor chain is "up and down", in naval parlance. If necessary, motoring slowly around the location of the anchor also helps dislodge it. Anchors are sometimes fitted with a <a href="tripping%20line">tripping line</a> attached to the crown, by which they can be unhooked from rocks or coral.

The term "aweigh" describes an anchor when it is hanging on the rope and is not resting on the bottom. This is linked to the term "to weigh anchor", meaning to lift the anchor from the sea bed, allowing the ship or boat to move. An anchor is described as "aweigh" when it has been broken out of the bottom and is being hauled up to be "stowed". "Aweigh" should not be confused with "under way", which describes a vessel which is not "moored" to a dock or "anchored", whether or not the vessel is moving through the water.

The earliest anchors were probably rocks, and many rock anchors have been found dating from at least the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. Pre-European Maori waka (canoes) used one or more hollowed stones, tied with flax ropes, as anchors. Many modern moorings still rely on a large rock as the primary element of their design. However, using pure mass to resist the forces of a storm only works well as a permanent mooring; a large enough rock would be nearly impossible to move to a new location.

The ancient Greeks used baskets of stones, large sacks filled with sand, and wooden logs filled with lead. According to <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Rhodes">Apollonius Rhodius</a> and <a href="Stephanus%20of%20Byzantium">Stephen of Byzantium</a>, anchors were formed of stone, and Athenaeus states that they were also sometimes made of wood. Such anchors held the vessel merely by their weight and by their friction along the bottom. Iron was afterwards introduced for the construction of anchors, and an improvement was made by forming them with teeth, or "flukes", to fasten themselves into the bottom.

The Admiralty Pattern, "A.P.", or simply "<a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>", and also known as "Fisherman", is the anchor shape most familiar to non-sailors. It consists of a central shank with a ring or <a href="shackle">shackle</a> for attaching the rode. At the other end of the shank there are two arms, carrying the flukes, while the stock is mounted to the other end, at ninety degrees to the arms. When the anchor lands on the bottom, it will generally fall over with the arms parallel to the seabed. As a strain comes onto the rode, the stock will dig into the bottom, canting the anchor until one of the flukes catches and digs into the bottom.

This basic design remained unchanged for centuries, with the most significant changes being to the overall proportions, and a move from stocks made of wood to iron stocks in the late 1830s and early 1840s. Since one fluke always protrudes up from the set anchor, there is a great tendency of the rode to foul the anchor as the vessel swings due to wind or current shifts. When this happens, the anchor may be pulled out of the bottom, and in some cases may need to be hauled up to be re-set. In the mid-19th century, numerous modifications were attempted to alleviate these problems, as well as improve holding power, including one-armed mooring anchors. The most successful of these "patent anchors", the Trotman Anchor, introduced a pivot where the arms join the shank, allowing the "idle" arm to fold against the shank.

Handling and storage of these anchors requires special equipment and procedures. Once the anchor is hauled up to the <a href="hawsepipe">hawsepipe</a>, the ring end is hoisted up to the end of a timber projecting from the bow known as the <a href="cathead">cathead</a>. The crown of the anchor is then hauled up with a heavy tackle until one fluke can be hooked over the rail. This is known as "catting and fishing" the anchor. Before dropping the anchor, the fishing process is reversed, and the anchor is dropped from the end of the cathead.

The stockless anchor, patented in England in 1821, represented the first significant departure in anchor design in centuries. Though their holding-power-to-weight ratio is significantly lower than admiralty pattern anchors, their ease of handling and stowage aboard large ships led to almost universal adoption. In contrast to the elaborate stowage procedures for earlier anchors, stockless anchors are simply hauled up until they rest with the shank inside the hawsepipes, and the flukes against the hull (or inside a recess in the hull).

While there are numerous variations, stockless anchors consist of a set of heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball and socket joint to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.

Until the mid-20th century, anchors for smaller vessels were either scaled-down versions of admiralty anchors, or simple <a href="grapnels">grapnels</a>. As new designs with greater holding-power-to-weight ratios, a great variety of anchor designs has emerged. Many of these designs are still under patent, and other types are best known by their original trademarked names.

A traditional design, the grapnel is merely a shank with four or more tines. It has a benefit in that, no matter how it reaches the bottom, one or more tines will be aimed to set. In coral, or rock, it is often able to set quickly by hooking into the structure, but may be more difficult to retrieve. A grapnel is often quite light, and may have additional uses as a tool to recover gear lost overboard. Its weight also makes it relatively easy to move and carry, however its shape is generally not very compact and it may be awkward to stow unless a collapsing model is used.

Grapnels rarely have enough fluke area to develop much hold in sand, clay, or mud. It is not unknown for the anchor to foul on its own rode, or to foul the tines with refuse from the bottom, preventing it from digging in. On the other hand, it is quite possible for this anchor to find such a good hook that, without a trip line from the crown, it is impossible to retrieve.

Designed by famous yacht designer <a href="Lewis%20Francis%20Herreshoff">L. Francis Herreshoff</a>, this is essentially the same pattern as an admiralty anchor, albeit with small diamond shaped flukes or palms. The novelty of the design lay in the means by which it could be broken down into three pieces for stowage. In use, it still presents all the issues of the admiralty pattern anchor.

Originally designed as a lightweight anchor for seaplanes, this design consists of two plough-like blades mounted to a shank, with a folding stock crossing through the crown of the anchor.

So named due to its resemblance to a traditional agricultural <a href="plough">plough</a> (or more specifically two <a href="plowshare">ploughshares</a>), many manufacturers produce a plough-style design, all based on or direct copies of the original CQR ("Secure"), a 1933 design patented in the UK (US patent in 1934) by mathematician <a href="Geoffrey%20Ingram%20Taylor">Geoffrey Ingram Taylor</a>. Ploughs are popular with cruising sailors and other private boaters. They are generally good in all bottoms, but not exceptional in any. The CQR design has a hinged shank. Despite the widely held belief that this is to allow the anchor to turn with direction changes rather than breaking out, the actual purpose is to prevent the weight of the shank from negatively impacting the fluke's orientation while setting. Other plough types have a rigid shank. Plough anchors are usually stowed in a roller at the bow.

Owing to the use of lead or other dedicated tip-weight, the plough is heavier than average for the amount of resistance developed, and may take more careful technique and a longer period to set thoroughly. It cannot be stored in a hawsepipe.

The Delta was developed in the 1980s for commercialization by British marine manufacturer Simpson–Lawrence.

American <a href="Richard%20Danforth">Richard Danforth</a> invented the Danforth pattern in the 1940s for use aboard <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>. It uses a stock at the crown to which two large flat triangular flukes are attached. The stock is hinged so the flukes can orient toward the bottom (and on some designs may be adjusted for an optimal angle depending on the bottom type). Tripping palms at the crown act to tip the flukes into the seabed. The design is a burying variety, and once well set can develop high resistance. Its lightweight and compact flat design make it easy to retrieve and relatively easy to store; some anchor rollers and hawsepipes can accommodate a fluke-style anchor.

A Danforth will not usually penetrate or hold in gravel or weeds. In boulders and coral it may hold by acting as a hook. If there is much current, or if the vessel is moving while dropping the anchor, it may "kite" or "skate" over the bottom due to the large fluke area acting as a sail or wing.

The FOB HP anchor, designed by Guy Royer in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> in the 1970s, is a Danforth variant designed to give increased holding through its use of rounded flukes setting at a 30° angle.

The Fortress is an aluminum alloy Danforth variant which was designed by American Don Hallerberg. This anchor can be disassembled for storage and it features an adjustable 32° and 45° shank/fluke angle to improve holding capability in common sea bottoms such as hard sand and soft mud. This anchor performed well in a 1989 US <a href="Naval%20Sea%20Systems%20Command">Naval Sea Systems Command</a> (NAVSEA) test. and in an August 2014 holding power test that was conducted in the soft mud bottoms of the Chesapeake Bay.

This claw-shaped anchor was designed by Peter Bruce from the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> in the 1970s. Bruce gained his early reputation from the production of large-scale commercial anchors for ships and fixed installations such as oil rigs. The Bruce and its copies, known generically as "claws", have become a popular option for small boaters. It was intended to address some of the problems of the only general-purpose option then available, the plough. Claw-types set quickly in most seabeds and although not an articulated design, they have the reputation of not breaking out with tide or wind changes, instead slowly turning in the bottom to align with the force.

Claw types have difficulty penetrating weedy bottoms and grass. They offer a fairly low holding-power-to-weight ratio and generally have to be oversized to compete with newer types. On the other hand, they have a good reputation in boulder bottoms, perform relatively well with low rode scopes and set fairly reliably. They cannot be used with hawsepipes.

In recent years there has been something of a spurt in anchor design. Primarily designed to set very quickly, then generate high holding power, these anchors (mostly proprietary inventions still under <a href="patent">patent</a>) are finding homes with users of small to medium-sized vessels.

These are used where the vessel is permanently or semi-permanently sited, for example in the case of <a href="lightvessel">lightvessel</a>s or channel marker <a href="buoy">buoy</a>s. The anchor needs to hold the vessel in all weathers, including the most severe <a href="storm">storm</a>, but needs to be lifted only occasionally, at most – for example, only if the vessel is to be towed into port for maintenance. An alternative to using an anchor under these circumstances, especially if the anchor need never be lifted at all, may be to use a <a href="Deep%20foundation">pile</a> <a href="Pile%20driver">driven</a> into the seabed.

Permanent anchors come in a wide range of types and have no standard form. A slab of rock with an iron staple in it to attach a chain to would serve the purpose, as would any dense object of appropriate weight (for instance, an <a href="Cylinder%20block">engine block</a>). Modern moorings may be anchored by sand screws, which look and act very much like oversized <a href="screw">screw</a>s drilled into the seabed, or by barbed metal beams pounded in (or even driven in with explosives) like pilings, or by a variety of other non-mass means of getting a grip on the bottom. One method of building a mooring is to use three or more conventional anchors laid out with short lengths of chain attached to a swivel, so no matter which direction the vessel moves, one or more anchors will be aligned to resist the force.

The mushroom anchor is suitable where the seabed is composed of silt or fine sand. It was invented by <a href="Robert%20Stevenson%20%28civil%20engineer%29">Robert Stevenson</a>, for use by an 82-ton converted fishing boat, "Pharos", which was used as a <a href="lightvessel">lightvessel</a> between 1807 and 1810 near to <a href="Inchcape">Bell Rock</a> whilst the <a href="Bell%20Rock%20Lighthouse">lighthouse</a> was being constructed. It was equipped with a 1.5-ton example.

It is shaped like an inverted mushroom, the head becoming buried in the silt. A counterweight is often provided at the other end of the shank to lay it down before it becomes buried.

A mushroom anchor will normally sink in the silt to the point where it has displaced its own weight in bottom material, thus greatly increasing its holding power. These anchors are only suitable for a silt or mud bottom, since they rely upon suction and cohesion of the bottom material, which rocky or coarse sand bottoms lack. The holding power of this anchor is at best about twice its weight until it becomes buried, when it can be as much as ten times its weight. They are available in sizes from about 10 lb up to several tons.

This is an anchor which relies solely on being a heavy weight. It is usually just a large block of concrete or stone at the end of the chain. Its holding power is defined by its weight underwater (i.e. taking its buoyancy into account) regardless of the type of seabed, although suction can increase this if it becomes buried. Consequently, deadweight anchors are used where mushroom anchors are unsuitable, for example in rock, gravel or coarse sand. An advantage of a deadweight anchor over a mushroom is that if it does become dragged, then it continues to provide its original holding force. The disadvantage of using deadweight anchors in conditions where a mushroom anchor could be used is that it needs to be around ten times the weight of the equivalent mushroom anchor.

Screw anchors can be used to anchor permanent moorings, floating docks, fish farms, etc. These anchors must be screwed into the seabed with the use of a tool, so require access to the bottom, either at low tide or by use of a diver. Hence they can be difficult to install in deep water without special equipment.

Weight for weight, screw anchors have a higher holding than other permanent designs, and so can be cheap and relatively easily installed, although may not be ideal in extremely soft mud.

There is a need in the oil-and-gas industry to resist large anchoring forces when laying pipelines and for drilling vessels. These anchors are installed and removed using a support tug and pennant/pendant wire. Some examples are the Stevin range supplied by Vrijhof Ankers. Large plate anchors such as the Stevmanta are used for permanent moorings.

The elements of anchoring gear include the anchor, the cable (also called a rode), the method of attaching the two together, the method of attaching the cable to the ship, charts, and a method of learning the depth of the water.

Vessels may carry a number of anchors: bower anchors (formerly known as "sheet anchors") are the main anchors used by a vessel and normally carried at the bow of the vessel. A kedge anchor is a light anchor used for <a href="Warping%20%28sailing%29">warping an anchor</a>, also known as "kedging", or more commonly on yachts for <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring</a> quickly or in benign conditions. A stream anchor, which is usually heavier than a "kedge anchor", can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted, such as rivers and channels. A Killick anchor is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.

Charts are vital to good anchoring. Knowing the location of potential dangers, as well as being useful in estimating the effects of weather and tide in the anchorage, is essential in choosing a good place to drop the hook. One can get by without referring to charts, but they are an important tool and a part of good anchoring gear, and a skilled mariner would not choose to anchor without them.

The depth of water is necessary for determining scope, which is the ratio of length of cable to the depth measured from the highest point (usually the anchor roller or bow chock) to the seabed. For example, if the water is deep, and the anchor roller is above the water, the scope is the ratio between the amount of cable let out and . For this reason it is important to have a reliable and accurate method of measuring the depth of water.

A cable or rode is the rope, chain, or combination thereof used to connect the anchor to the vessel.

Chain rode is relatively heavy but resists abrasion from coral sharp rocks or shellfish beds which may abrade a pure rope warp. Fibre rope is more susceptible to abrasion on the seabed or obstructions, and is more likely to fail without warning.

Combinations of a length of chain shackled to the anchor, with rope added to the other end of the chain are a common compromise on small craft.

The best rope for warps is nylon which is strong and flexible. Terylene (polyester) is stronger but has less flex. Both ropes sink, so they avoid fouling other craft in crowded anchorages and do not absorb much water. Neither breaks down quickly in sunlight. Polypropylene or polythene are not suited to warps as they float and are much weaker than nylon and only slightly stronger than natural fibres. They break down in sunlight. Natural fibres such as manila or hemp are still used in developing nations but absorb much water, are relatively weak and rot. They do give good grip and are often very cheap. All anchors should have chain at least equal to the boat's length. Some skippers prefer an all chain warp for added security in coral waters. Boats less than 8 m typically use 6 mm galvanized chain. 8–14 m craft use 9 mm chain and over 14 m use 12 mm chain. The chain should be shackled to the warp through a steel eye or spliced to the chain using a chain splice. The shackle pin should be securely wired. Either galvanized or stainless steel is suitable for eyes and shackles.

In moderate conditions the ratio of warp to water depth should be 4:1. In rough conditions it should be twice this with the extra length giving more stretch to resist the anchor breaking out. This means that small craft under 5 m should carry at least 50 m of 8 mm warp. 5–8 m craft 75–100 m of 10 mm warp. 8–14 m should carry 100–125 m of 12 mm warp and over 16 m the same length but 16 mm warp.

The basic anchoring consists of determining the location, dropping the anchor, laying out the scope, setting the hook, and assessing where the vessel ends up. The ship will seek a location which is sufficiently protected; has suitable holding ground, enough depth at low tide and enough room for the boat to swing.

The location to drop the anchor should be approached from down wind or down current, whichever is stronger. As the chosen spot is approached, the vessel should be stopped or even beginning to drift back. The anchor should be lowered quickly but under control until it is on the bottom. The vessel should continue to drift back, and the cable should be veered out under control so it will be relatively straight.

Once the desired scope is laid out, the vessel should be gently forced astern, usually using the auxiliary motor but possibly by backing a sail. A hand on the anchor line may telegraph a series of jerks and jolts, indicating the anchor is dragging, or a smooth tension indicative of digging in. As the anchor begins to dig in and resist backward force, the engine may be throttled up to get a thorough set. If the anchor continues to drag, or sets after having dragged too far, it should be retrieved and moved back to the desired position (or another location chosen.)

There are techniques of anchoring to limit the swing of a vessel if the anchorage has limited room:

Lowering a concentrated, heavy weight down the anchor line – rope or chain – directly in front of the bow to the seabed behaves like a heavy chain rode and lowers the angle of pull on the anchor. If the weight is suspended off the seabed it acts as a spring or shock absorber to dampen the sudden actions that are normally transmitted to the anchor and can cause it to dislodge and drag. In light conditions, a kellet will reduce the swing of the vessel considerably. In heavier conditions these effects disappear as the rode becomes straightened and the weight ineffective. Known as a "anchor chum weight" or "angel" in the UK.

Using two anchors set approximately 45° apart, or wider angles up to 90°, from the bow is a strong mooring for facing into strong winds. To set anchors in this way, first one anchor is set in the normal fashion. Then, taking in on the first cable as the boat is motored into the wind and letting slack while drifting back, a second anchor is set approximately a half-scope away from the first on a line perpendicular to the wind. After this second anchor is set, the scope on the first is taken up until the vessel is lying between the two anchors and the load is taken equally on each cable.
This moor also to some degree limits the range of a vessel's swing to a narrower oval. Care should be taken that other vessels will not swing down on the boat due to the limited swing range.

(Not to be mistaken with the "Bahamian moor", below.) In the "bow and stern" technique, an anchor is set off each the bow and the stern, which can severely limit a vessel's swing range and also align it to steady wind, current or wave conditions. One method of accomplishing this moor is to set a bow anchor normally, then drop back to the limit of the bow cable (or to double the desired scope, e.g. 8:1 if the eventual scope should be 4:1, 10:1 if the eventual scope should be 5:1, etc.) to lower a stern anchor. By taking up on the bow cable the stern anchor can be set. After both anchors are set, tension is taken up on both cables to limit the swing or to align the vessel.

Similar to the above, a "Bahamian moor" is used to sharply limit the swing range of a vessel, but allows it to swing to a current. One of the primary characteristics of this technique is the use of a swivel as follows: the first anchor is set normally, and the vessel drops back to the limit of anchor cable. A second anchor is attached to the end of the anchor cable, and is dropped and set. A swivel is attached to the middle of the anchor cable, and the vessel connected to that.

The vessel will now swing in the middle of two anchors, which is acceptable in strong reversing currents, but a wind perpendicular to the current may break out the anchors, as they are not aligned for this load.

Also known as "tandem anchoring", in this technique two anchors are deployed in line with each other, on the same rode. With the foremost anchor reducing the load on the aft-most, this technique can develop great holding power and may be appropriate in "ultimate storm" circumstances. It does not limit swinging range, and might not be suitable in some circumstances. There are complications, and the technique requires careful preparation and a level of skill and experience above that required for a single anchor.

"Kedging" or "<a href="Warping%20%28sailing%29">warping</a>" is a technique for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively light anchor.

In yachts, a kedge anchor is an anchor carried in addition to the main, or bower anchors, and usually stowed aft. Every yacht should carry at least two anchors – the main or "bower" anchor and a second lighter "kedge" anchor. It is used occasionally when it is necessary to limit the turning circle as the yacht swings when it is anchored, such as in a very narrow river or a deep pool in an otherwise shallow area.

For ships, a kedge may be dropped while a ship is underway, or carried out in a suitable direction by a tender or ship's boat to enable the ship to be winched off if aground or swung into a particular heading, or even to be held steady against a tidal or other stream.

Historically, it was of particular relevance to sailing warships which used them to outmaneuver opponents when the wind had dropped but might be used by any vessel in confined, shoal water to place it in a more desirable position, provided she had enough manpower.

Club hauling is an archaic technique. When a vessel is in a narrow channel or on a lee shore so that there is no room to tack the vessel in a conventional manner, an anchor attached to the lee quarter may be dropped from the lee bow. This is deployed when the vessel is head to wind and has lost headway. As the vessel gathers sternway the strain on the cable pivots the vessel around what is now the weather quarter turning the vessel onto the other tack. The anchor is then normally cut away, as it cannot be recovered.

An anchor frequently appears on the flags and coats of arms of institutions involved with the sea, both naval and commercial, as well as of port cities and seacoast regions and provinces in various countries. There also exists in heraldry the "<a href="Anchored%20Cross">Anchored Cross</a>", or <a href="St.%20Clement%27s%20Cross">Mariner's Cross</a>, a stylized cross in the shape of an anchor. The symbol can be used to signify 'fresh start' or 'hope'. The New Testament refers to the Christian's hope as "an anchor of the soul" (<a href="https%3A//www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3Fsearch%3Dhebrews%2B6.19%26amp%3Bversion%3DNASB">Hebrews 6:19</a>). In 1887, the Delta Gamma Fraternity adopted the anchor as its badge to signify hope. The Mariner's Cross is also referred to as <a href="Pope%20Clement%20I">St. Clement's Cross</a>, in reference to the way this saint was martyred (being tied to an anchor and thrown from a boat into the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> in 102). Anchored crosses are occasionally a feature of <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a> in which context they are referred to by the <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> terms "anchry" or "ancre".

Anbar (town)

Anbar () was a town in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, at lat. 33 deg. 22' N., long. 43 deg. 49' E, on the east bank of the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, just south of the Nahr 'Isa, or Sakhlawieh <a href="canal">canal</a>, the northernmost of the canals connecting that river with the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>.

Anbar was originally called Pērōz-Šāpūr or Pērōz-Šābuhr (from , meaning "Victorious Shapur"; in "prgwzšhypwhr"; in ), and became known as Perisapora or Pirisabora to the Greeks and Romans. The city was founded by the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Persian</a> king <a href="Shapur%20II">Shapur II</a>, and located in the Sassanid province of <a href="As%C5%8Drist%C4%81n">Asōristān</a>. Perisapora was sacked and burned by Emperor <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a> in April 363, during <a href="Julian%27s%20Persian%20War">his invasion</a> of the <a href="Sasanian%20Empire">Sasanian Empire</a>. The town became a refuge for the Arab, Christian and Jewish colonies of that region. According to medieval Arabic sources, most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to found the city of <a href="Hdatta">Hdatta</a> south of <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a>.

Anbar was adjacent or identical to the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Iraq%23Babylonia%20as%20the%20center%20of%20Judaism">Babylonian Jewish</a> center of <a href="Nehardea">Nehardea</a> (), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a>, formerly the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Iraq%23Babylonia%20as%20the%20center%20of%20Judaism">Babylonian Jewish</a> center of <a href="Pumbedita">Pumbedita</a> ().

Anazarbus

Anazarbus (, medieval Ain Zarba; modern Anavarza; ) was an ancient <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>n city and (arch)bishopric, which remains a Latin Catholic <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a>.

It was situated in <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> in modern Turkey, in the present <a href="%C3%87ukurova">Çukurova</a> (or classical <a href="Aleian%20plain">Aleian plain</a>) about 15 km west of the main stream of the present <a href="Ceyhan%20River">Ceyhan River</a> (or classical <a href="Pyramus%20river">Pyramus river</a>) and near its tributary the <a href="Sempas%20Su">Sempas Su</a>.

A lofty isolated ridge formed its <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the <a href="Suda">Suda</a>'s identification of it with <a href="Cyinda">Cyinda</a>, famous as a treasure city in the wars of <a href="Eumenes%20of%20Cardia">Eumenes of Cardia</a>, cannot be accepted in the face of <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.

It was founded by <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>. Under the early <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> the place was known as Caesarea, and was the Metropolis (capital) of Late <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> <a href="Cilicia%20Secunda">Cilicia Secunda</a>. It was the home of the poet <a href="Oppian">Oppian</a>.
Rebuilt by the <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Justin%20I">Justin I</a> after an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> in the 6th century, it became Justinopolis (525); but the old native name persisted, and when <a href="Thoros%20I%20of%20Armenia">Thoros I</a>, king of <a href="Lesser%20Armenia">Lesser Armenia</a>, made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as Anazarva.

Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which <a href="debouches">debouched</a> from the <a href="Cilician%20Gates">Cilician Gates</a>, made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and the early Muslim invaders. It had been rebuilt by <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> in 796, refortified at great expense by the <a href="Hamdanid">Hamdanid</a> <a href="Sayf%20al-Dawla">Sayf al-Dawla</a> (mid-10th century) and again destroyed in 962 by <a href="Nikephoros%20II%20Phokas">Nikephoros II Phokas</a>.

In late 1097 or early 1098 it was captured by the armies of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> and was incorporated into Bohemond's Principality of Antioch. The Crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop. Most of the remaining fortifications, including the curtain walls, massive horse-shaped towers, undercrofts, cisterns, and free-standing structures date from the Armenian periods of occupation, which began with the arrival of the <a href="Thoros%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Armenia">Rubenid Baron T‛oros I</a>, . The site briefly exchanged hands between the Greeks and Armenians, until it was formally part of the <a href="Armenian%20Kingdom%20of%20Cilicia">Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia</a>. Within the fortress are two Armenian chapels and the magnificent (but severely damaged) three-aisle church built by T‛oros I to celebrate his conquests. The church was once surrounded by a continuous, well-executed dedicatory inscription in Armenian.

The <a href="Mamluk">Mamluk</a> Empire of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction. It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, the colonnades of two streets, a <a href="gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a>, etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine <a href="aqueduct%20%28watercourse%29">aqueduct</a>s to their sources. A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.

A visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

A modest Turkish farming village (<a href="Dilekkaya%2C%20Kozan">Dilekkaya</a>) lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field. Inquire at the museum for a viewing.

Anazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia. The <a href="Sis%20%28ancient%20city%29">castle of Sis</a> (modern <a href="Kozan%2C%20Adana">Kozan, Adana</a>) lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and <a href="Yilankale">Yilankale</a> are to the south, and the fortresses of <a href="Amouda">Amouda</a> and <a href="Sarvandikar">Sarvandikar</a> are to the east.

Anagram

An anagram is word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word "anagram" can be rearranged into "nag a ram".

The original word or phrase is known as the "subject" of the anagram. Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an "anagrammatist", and the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to produce anagrams that reflect or comment on their subject.

Anagrams may be created as a commentary on the subject. For example, it may be a synonym or antonym of its subject, a parody, a criticism, satire:


It sometimes changes a proper noun or personal name into a sentence:


It can change <a href="parts%20of%20speech">parts of speech</a>, such as the adjective "silent" to the verb "listen". "Anagrams" itself can be anagrammatized as ""Ars magna"" (Latin, 'the great art').

Anagrams can be traced back to the time of Moses, as "Themuru" or changing, which was to find the hidden and mystical meaning in names.
They were popular throughout Europe during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, for example with the poet and composer <a href="Guillaume%20de%20Machaut">Guillaume de Machaut</a>. They are said to go back at least to the Greek poet <a href="Lycophron">Lycophron</a>, in the third century BCE; but this relies on an account of Lycophron given by <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a> in the 12th century.

Anagrams in <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> were considered witty over many centuries. "Est vir qui adest", explained below, was cited as the example in <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>'s "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20English%20Language">A Dictionary of the English Language</a>".

Any historical material on anagrams must always be interpreted in terms of the assumptions and spellings that were current for the language in question. In particular, spelling in English only slowly became fixed. There were attempts to regulate anagram formation, an important one in English being that of <a href="George%20Puttenham">George Puttenham</a>'s "Of the Anagram or Posy Transposed" in "The Art of English Poesie" (1589).

As a literary game when Latin was the common property of the literate, Latin anagrams were prominent: two examples are the change of "<a href="Ave%20Maria">Ave Maria</a>, gratia plena, Dominus tecum" ("Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord [is] with you") into "Virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata" ("Serene virgin, pious, clean and spotless"), and the anagrammatic answer to <a href="Pilate">Pilate</a>'s question, "Quid est veritas?" ("What is truth?"), namely, "Est vir qui adest" ("It is the man who is here"). The origins of these are not documented.

Latin continued to influence letter values (such as I = J, U = V and W = VV). There was an ongoing tradition of allowing anagrams to be "perfect" if the letters were all used once, but allowing for these interchanges. This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>: "Societas Jesu" turned into "Vitiosa seces", or "Cut off the wicked things". Puttenham, in the time of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, wished to start from "Elissabet Anglorum Regina" (Elizabeth Queen of the English), to obtain "Multa regnabis ense gloria" (By thy sword shalt thou reign in great renown); he explains carefully that H is "a note of aspiration only and no letter", and that Z in Greek or Hebrew is a mere SS. The rules were not completely fixed in the 17th century. <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> in his "Remains" commented, singling out some letters—Æ, K, W, and Z—not found in the classical Roman alphabet:

When it comes to the 17th century and anagrams in English or other languages, there is a great deal of documented evidence of learned interest. The lawyer <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Brackley">Thomas Egerton</a> was praised through the anagram "gestat honorem" ('he carries honor'); the physician <a href="George%20Ent">George Ent</a> took the anagrammatic motto "genio surget" ('he rises through spirit/genius'), which requires his first name as "Georgius". <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I's</a> courtiers discovered in "James Stuart" "a just master", and converted "<a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles James Stuart</a>" into "Claims <a href="King%20Arthur">Arthur</a>'s seat" (even at that point in time, the letters I and J were more-or-less interchangeable). Walter Quin, tutor to the future Charles I, worked hard on multilingual anagrams on the name of father James. A notorious murder scandal, the Overbury case, threw up two imperfect anagrams that were aided by typically loose spelling and were recorded by <a href="Simonds%20D%27Ewes">Simonds D'Ewes</a>: "Francis Howard" (for <a href="Frances%20Carr%2C%20Countess%20of%20Somerset">Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset</a>, her maiden name spelled in a variant) became "Car findes a whore", with the letters E hardly counted, and the victim <a href="Thomas%20Overbury">Thomas Overbury</a>, as "Thomas Overburie", was written as "O! O! a busie murther" (an old form of "murder"), with a V counted as U.

<a href="William%20Drummond%20of%20Hawthornden">William Drummond of Hawthornden</a>, in an essay "On the Character of a Perfect Anagram", tried to lay down rules for permissible substitutions (such as S standing for Z) and letter omissions. <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> provided a definition of "Anagrammatisme" as "a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, subtraction or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sense applyable (i.e., applicable) to the person named." <a href="John%20Dryden">Dryden</a> in "<a href="MacFlecknoe">MacFlecknoe</a>" disdainfully called the pastime the "torturing of one poor word ten thousand ways".

"Eleanor Audeley", wife of <a href="Sir%20John%20Davies">Sir John Davies</a>, is said to have been brought before the <a href="High%20Commission">High Commission</a> in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to "Reveale, O Daniel", and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by <a href="Sir%20John%20Lambe">Sir John Lambe</a>, the <a href="Dean%20of%20Arches">dean of the Arches</a>, "Dame Eleanor Davies", "Never soe mad a ladie".

An example from France was a flattering anagram for <a href="Cardinal%20Richelieu">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, comparing him to <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> or at least one of his hands (Hercules being a kingly symbol), where "Armand de Richelieu" became "Ardue main d'Hercule" ("difficult hand of Hercules").

Examples from the nineteenth century are the transposition of "<a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>" into ""Honor est a Nilo"" (Latin = 'Honor is from the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Nile</a>'); and of "<a href="Florence%20Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>" into "Flit on, cheering angel". The Victorian love of anagramming as recreation is alluded to by <a href="Augustus%20De%20Morgan">Augustus De Morgan</a> using his own name as example; "Great Gun, do us a sum!" is attributed to his son <a href="William%20De%20Morgan">William De Morgan</a>, but a family friend <a href="John%20T.%20Graves">John Thomas Graves</a> was prolific, and a manuscript with over 2,800 has been preserved.

With the advent of <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a> as a poetic movement, anagrams regained the artistic respect they had had in the <a href="Baroque%20period">Baroque period</a>. The German poet <a href="Unica%20Z%C3%BCrn">Unica Zürn</a>, who made extensive use of anagram techniques, came to regard obsession with anagrams as a "dangerous fever", because it created isolation of the author. The surrealist leader <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a> coined the anagram "Avida Dollars" for <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>, to tarnish his reputation by the implication of commercialism.

While anagramming is certainly a recreation first, there are ways in which anagrams are put to use, and these can be more serious, or at least not quite frivolous and formless. For example, psychologists use anagram-oriented tests, often called "anagram solution tasks", to assess the <a href="implicit%20memory">implicit memory</a> of young adults and adults alike.

Natural philosophers (astronomers and others) of the 17th century transposed their discoveries into Latin anagrams, to establish their priority. In this way they laid claim to new discoveries, before their results were ready for publication.

<a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> used "smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras" for "Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi" ("I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form") for discovering the <a href="rings%20of%20Saturn">rings of Saturn</a> in 1610. Galileo announced his discovery that <a href="Venus">Venus</a> had <a href="Moon%20phase">phases</a> like the Moon in the form "Haec immatura a me iam frustra leguntur -oy" (Latin: "These immature ones have already been read in vain by me -oy"), that is, when rearranged, "Cynthiae figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum" (Latin: "The Mother of Loves [= Venus] imitates the figures of <a href="Artemis">Cynthia</a> [= the moon]").

When <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> discovered <a href="Hooke%27s%20law">Hooke's law</a> in 1660, he first published it in anagram form, "ceiiinosssttuv", for "ut tensio, sic vis" (Latin: "as the tension, so the force").

In a related use, from 1975, British naturalist <a href="Sir%20Peter%20Scott">Sir Peter Scott</a> coined the scientific term "Nessiteras rhombopteryx" (Greek for "The monster (or wonder) of <a href="Loch%20Ness">Ness</a> with the diamond-shaped fin") for the <a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a> <a href="Loch%20Ness%20Monster">Loch Ness Monster</a>. Shortly afterwards, several London newspapers pointed out that "Nessiteras rhombopteryx" anagrams into "Monster hoax by Sir Peter S". However, <a href="Robert%20Rines">Robert Rines</a>, who previously made two underwater photographs allegedly showing the monster, countered with the fact that they can also be arranged into "Yes, both pix are monsters, R."

Anagrams are connected to pseudonyms, by the fact that they may conceal or reveal, or operate somewhere in between like a mask that can establish identity. For example, <a href="Jim%20Morrison">Jim Morrison</a> used an anagram of his name in <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a> song "<a href="L.A.%20Woman%20%28song%29">L.A. Woman</a>", calling himself "Mr. Mojo Risin' ". The use of anagrams and fabricated personal names may be to circumvent restrictions on the use of real names, as happened in the 18th century when <a href="Edward%20Cave">Edward Cave</a> wanted to get around restrictions imposed on the reporting of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>. In a genre such as <a href="farce">farce</a> or <a href="parody">parody</a>, anagrams as names may be used for pointed and satiric effect.

Pseudonyms adopted by authors are sometimes transposed forms of their names; thus "<a href="John%20Calvin">Calvinus</a>" becomes "Alcuinus" (here V = U) or "<a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais">François Rabelais</a>" = "Alcofribas Nasier". The name "<a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>" of François Marie Arouet fits this pattern, and is allowed to be an anagram of "Arouet, l[e] j[eune]" (U = V, J = I) that is, "Arouet the younger". Other examples include
Several of these are "imperfect anagrams", letters having been left out in some cases for the sake of easy pronunciation.

Anagrams used for titles afford scope for some types of wit. Examples:

In Hebrew, the name "<a href="Gernot%20Zippe">Gernot Zippe</a>" (גרנוט ציפה), the inventor of the <a href="Zippe-type%20centrifuge">Zippe-type centrifuge</a>, is an anagram of the word "Centrifuge" (צנטריפוגה).

Anagrams are in themselves a recreational activity, but they also make up part of many other games, puzzles and game shows. The <a href="Jumble">Jumble</a> is a puzzle found in many newspapers in the United States requiring the unscrambling of letters to find the solution. <a href="Cryptic%20crossword">Cryptic crossword</a> puzzles frequently use anagrammatic clues, usually indicating that they are anagrams by the inclusion of a descriptive term like "confused" or "in disarray". An example would be "Businessman burst into tears (9 letters)". The solution, "stationer", is an anagram of "into tears", the letters of which have "burst" out of their original arrangement to form the name of a type of "businessman".

Some games even use anagrams in their plot. For example, the game <a href="Undertale">Undertale</a> uses Delta Rune as an anagram of its title to represent the Dreemurr royal family and the name of their symbol.

Numerous other games and contests involve some element of anagram formation as a basic skill. Some examples:

Multiple anagramming is a technique used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a <a href="permutation%20cipher">permutation cipher</a>, a <a href="transposition%20cipher">transposition cipher</a>, and the <a href="Jefferson%20disk">Jefferson disk</a>. Solutions may be computationally found using a <a href="Jumble%20algorithm">Jumble algorithm</a>.

Sometimes it is possible to "see" anagrams in words, unaided by tools, though the more letters involved the more difficult this becomes. <a href="Anagram%20dictionary">Anagram dictionaries</a> could also be used. Computer programs, known as "anagram servers", "anagram solvers" or "anagrammers", offer a much faster route to creating anagrams, and a large number of these programs are available on the Internet. The <a href="Computer%20program">program</a> or <a href="Server%20%28computing%29">server</a> carries out an exhaustive search of a database of words, to produce a list containing every possible combination of words or phrases from the input word or phrase using a <a href="jumble%20algorithm">jumble algorithm</a>. Some programs (such as "Lexpert") restrict to one-word answers. Many anagram servers (for example, <a href="http%3A//findwords.online4me.com">The Words Oracle</a>) can control the search results, by excluding or including certain words, limiting the number or length of words in each anagram, or limiting the number of results. Anagram solvers are often banned from online anagram games. The disadvantage of computer anagram solvers, especially when applied to multi-word anagrams, is their poor understanding of the meaning of the words they are manipulating. They usually cannot filter out meaningful or appropriate anagrams from large numbers of nonsensical word combinations. Some servers attempt to improve on this using statistical techniques that try to combine only words that appear together often. This approach provides only limited success since it fails to recognize ironic and humorous combinations.

Some anagrammatists indicate the method they used. Anagrams constructed without aid of a computer are noted as having been done "manually" or "by hand"; those made by utilizing a computer may be noted "by machine" or "by computer", or may indicate the name of the computer program (using "Anagram Genius").

There are also a few "natural" instances: English words unconsciously created by switching letters around. The French "chaise longue" ("long chair") became the American "<a href="chaise%20longue">chaise lounge</a>" by <a href="metathesis%20%28linguistics%29">metathesis</a> (transposition of letters and/or sounds). It has also been speculated that the English "curd" comes from the Latin "crudus" ("raw"). Similarly, the ancient English word for bird was "brid".

Anadyr River

Anadyr () is a river in the far northeast Siberia which flows into <a href="Anadyr%20Bay">Anadyr Bay</a> of the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a> and drains much of the interior of <a href="Chukotka%20Autonomous%20Okrug">Chukotka Autonomous Okrug</a>. Its basin corresponds to the <a href="Anadyrsky%20District">Anadyrsky District</a> of Chukotka.

The Anadyr is long and has a basin of . It is frozen from October to late May and has a maximum flow in June with the snowmelt. It is navigable in small boats for about to near <a href="Markovo%2C%20Chukotka%20Autonomous%20Okrug">Markovo</a>. West of Markovo it is in the Anadyr Highlands (moderate mountains and valleys with a few trees) and east of Markovo it moves into the Anadyr lowlands (very flat treeless tundra with lakes and bogs). The drop from Markovo to the sea is less than .

It rises at about 67°N latitude and 173°E longitude near the headwaters of the <a href="Maly%20Anyuy%20River">Maly Anyuy River</a>, flows southwest receiving the waters of the Yablon and Eropol Rivers, turns east and passes <a href="Markovo%2C%20Chukotka%20Autonomous%20Okrug">Markvovo</a> and the old site of <a href="Anadyrsk">Anadyrsk</a>, turns north and east and receives the <a href="Mayn%20River">Mayn River</a> from the south, thereby encircling the Lebediny <a href="Zakaznik">Zakaznik</a>, turns northeast to receive the <a href="Belaya%20River%20%28Chukotka%29">Belaya River (Chukotka)</a> from the north, turns southeast past the Ust-Tanyurer <a href="Zakaznik">Zakaznik</a> and receives the <a href="Tanyurer%20River">Tanyurer River</a> from the north. At <a href="Lake%20Krasnoye%20%28Chukotka%29">Lake Krasnoye</a>, it turns east and flows into the Onemen Bay of the <a href="Anadyr%20Estuary">Anadyr Estuary</a>. If the Onemen Bay is considered part of the river, it also receives the <a href="Velikaya%20River%20%28Chukotka%29">Velikaya River (Chukotka)</a> from the south and the <a href="Kanchalan%20River">Kanchalan River</a> from the north.

Its basin is surrounded by (north) <a href="Amguyema%20River">Amguyema River</a> and <a href="Palyavaam%20River">Palyavaam River</a>, (northwest) <a href="Bolshoy%20Anyuy%20River">Bolshoy Anyuy River</a> and the Oloy branch of the <a href="Omolon%20River">Omolon River</a> and (southwest) <a href="Penzhin%20Bay">Penzhina River</a>.

In 1648 <a href="Semyon%20Dezhnyov">Semyon Dezhnev</a> reached the mouth of the Anadyr after being shipwrecked on the coast. In 1649 he went upriver and built winter quarters at <a href="Anadyrsk">Anadyrsk</a>. For the next 100 years the Anadyr was the main route from the Arctic to the Pacific and Kamchatka. In the 18th century, the Anadyr was described by the polar explorer <a href="Dmitry%20Laptev">Dmitry Laptev</a>.

The country through which it passes is thinly populated, and is dominated by <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, with a rich variety of plant life. Much of the region has beautiful landscapes, dominated by often spectacular, rugged mountains. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and the frozen rivers become navigable roads. George Kennan, an American working on the <a href="Western%20Union%20Telegraph%20Expedition">Western Union Telegraph Expedition</a> in the late 1860s, found that dog sled travel on the lower Anadyr was limited by lack of firewood.

<a href="Reindeer">Reindeer</a>, upon which the local inhabitants subsisted, were once found in considerable numbers, but the domestic reindeer population has collapsed dramatically since the reorganization and privatization of state-run collective farms beginning in 1992. As herds of domestic reindeer have declined, herds of wild <a href="caribou">caribou</a> have increased.

There are ten species of <a href="salmon">salmon</a> inhabiting the Anadyr river basin. Every year, on the last Sunday in April, there is an ice fishing competition in the frozen estuarine waters of the Anadyr River's mouth. This festival is locally known as Korfest.

The area is a summering place for a number of migratory birds including <a href="brent%20goose">brent geese</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a>s, and the <a href="northern%20pintail">pintails</a> of <a href="California">California</a>.

André-Marie Ampère

André-Marie Ampère (; ; 20 January 177510 June 1836) was a <a href="French%20people">French</a> <a href="physicist">physicist</a> and <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> who was one of the founders of the science of <a href="classical%20electromagnetism">classical electromagnetism</a>, which he referred to as "electrodynamics". He is also the inventor of numerous applications, such as the <a href="solenoid">solenoid</a> (a term coined by him) and the electrical <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a>. An autodidact, Ampère was a member of the "<a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20sciences">Académie des sciences</a>" and professor at the "<a href="%C3%89cole%20polytechnique">École polytechnique</a>" and the "<a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>".

The <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">SI</a> unit of measurement of <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a>, the <a href="ampere">ampere</a>, is named after him. His name is also one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%2072%20names%20on%20the%20Eiffel%20Tower">72 names inscribed</a> on the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>.

Andre-Marie Ampère was born on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques Ampère, a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desutières-Sarcey Ampère, during the height of the <a href="French%20Enlightenment">French Enlightenment</a>. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at <a href="Poleymieux-au-Mont-d%27Or">Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or</a> near Lyon. Jean-Jacques Ampère, a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise <a href="Emile%2C%20or%20On%20Education">Émile</a>) were the basis of Ampère's education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an "education direct from nature." Ampère's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as <a href="Georges%20Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Count%20of%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon</a>'s "Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière" (begun in 1749) and <a href="Denis%20Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> and <a href="Jean%20le%20Rond%20d%27Alembert">Jean le Rond d'Alembert</a>'s "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A9die">Encyclopédie</a>" (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Ampère's schoolmasters. The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his <a href="Latin">Latin</a> lessons, which enabled him to master the works of <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Bernoulli">Daniel Bernoulli</a>.

In addition, Ampère used his access to the latest books to begin teaching himself advanced mathematics at age 12. In later life Ampère claimed that he knew as much about mathematics and science when he was eighteen as ever he knew; but, a <a href="polymath">polymath</a>, his reading embraced history, travels, poetry, philosophy, and the natural sciences. His mother was a devout woman, so Ampère was also initiated into the <a href="Catholicism">Catholic faith</a> along with Enlightenment science. The <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> (1789–99) that began during his youth was also influential: Ampère's father was called into <a href="Civil%20service">public service</a> by the new revolutionary government, becoming a justice of the peace in a small town near Lyon. When the <a href="Jacobin">Jacobin</a> faction seized control of the Revolutionary government in 1792, his father Jean-Jacques Ampère resisted the new political tides, and he was <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>d on 24 November 1793, as part of the <a href="Jacobin%23The%20Terror">Jacobin purges</a> of the period.

In 1796 Ampère met Julie Carron, and in 1799 they were married. André-Marie Ampère took his first regular job in 1799 as a <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> teacher, which gave him the financial security to marry Carron and father his first child, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Amp%C3%A8re">Jean-Jacques</a> (named after his father), the next year. (Jean-Jacques Ampère eventually achieved his own fame as a scholar of languages). Ampère's maturation corresponded with the transition to the <a href="Napoleonic%20era">Napoleonic regime</a> in France, and the young father and teacher found new opportunities for success within the technocratic structures favoured by the new French <a href="Napoleon">First Counsel</a>. In 1802 Ampère was appointed a professor of <a href="physics">physics</a> and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> at the École Centrale in <a href="Bourg-en-Bresse">Bourg-en-Bresse</a>, leaving his ailing wife and infant son in Lyon. He used his time in Bourg to research mathematics, producing "Considérations sur la théorie mathématique de jeu" (1802; "Considerations on the Mathematical Theory of Games"), a treatise on <a href="Probability%20theory">mathematical probability</a> that he sent to the <a href="Paris%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Paris Academy of Sciences</a> in 1803.

After the death of his wife in July 1803, Ampère moved to <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, where he began a tutoring post at the new <a href="%C3%89cole%20Polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> in 1804. Despite his lack of formal qualifications, Ampère was appointed a professor of mathematics at the school in 1809. As well as holding positions at this school until 1828, in 1819 and 1820 Ampère offered courses in <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, respectively, at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>, and in 1824 he was elected to the prestigious chair in <a href="experimental%20physics">experimental physics</a> at the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>. In 1814 Ampère was invited to join the class of mathematicians in the new "Institut Impérial", the umbrella under which the reformed state Academy of Sciences would sit.

Ampère engaged in a diverse array of scientific inquiries during the years leading up to his election to the academy—writing papers and engaging in topics from mathematics and philosophy to chemistry and astronomy. was customary among the leading scientific intellectuals of the day. Ampère claimed that "at eighteen years he found three culminating points in his life, his <a href="First%20Communion">First Communion</a>, the reading of Antoine Leonard Thomas's "Eulogy of Descartes", and the <a href="Taking%20of%20the%20Bastille">Taking of the Bastille</a>. On the day of his wife's death he wrote two verses from the <a href="Psalm">Psalm</a>s, and the prayer, 'O Lord, God of Mercy, unite me in Heaven with those whom you have permitted me to love on earth.' In times of duress he would take refuge in the reading of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and the <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers of the Church</a>."

For a time he took into his family the young student <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Ozanam">Frédéric Ozanam</a> (1813–1853), one of the founders of the <a href="Conference%20of%20Charity">Conference of Charity</a>, later known as the <a href="Society%20of%20Saint%20Vincent%20de%20Paul">Society of Saint Vincent de Paul</a>. Through Ampère, Ozanam had contact with leaders of the neo-Catholic movement, such as <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a>, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Henri%20Lacordaire">Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Forbes%20Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Montalembert">Charles Forbes René de Montalembert</a>. Ozanam was <a href="Beatification">beatified</a> by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> in 1998.

In September 1820, Ampère's friend and eventual eulogist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Arago">François Arago</a> showed the members of the French Academy of Sciences the surprising discovery of <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> physicist <a href="Hans%20Christian%20%C3%98rsted">Hans Christian Ørsted</a> that a <a href="Compass">magnetic needle</a> is deflected by an adjacent <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a>. Ampère began developing a mathematical and physical theory to understand the relationship between <a href="electricity">electricity</a> and <a href="magnetism">magnetism</a>. Furthering Ørsted's experimental work, Ampère showed that two parallel wires carrying electric currents attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents flow in the same or opposite directions, respectively - this laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He also applied mathematics in generalizing physical laws from these experimental results. The most important of these was the principle that came to be called <a href="Amp%C3%A8re%27s%20force%20law">Ampère's law</a>, which states that the mutual action of two lengths of current-carrying wire is proportional to their lengths and to the intensities of their currents. Ampère also applied this same principle to magnetism, showing the harmony between his law and French physicist <a href="Charles%20Augustin%20de%20Coulomb">Charles Augustin de Coulomb</a>'s law of magnetic action. Ampère's devotion to, and skill with, experimental techniques anchored his science within the emerging fields of experimental physics.

Ampère also provided a physical understanding of the electromagnetic relationship, theorizing the existence of an "electrodynamic molecule" (the forerunner of the idea of the <a href="electron">electron</a>) that served as the component element of both electricity and magnetism. Using this physical explanation of electromagnetic motion, Ampère developed a physical account of electromagnetic phenomena that was both empirically demonstrable and mathematically predictive. In 1827 Ampère published his magnum opus, "Mémoire sur la théorie mathématique des phénomènes électrodynamiques uniquement déduite de l’experience" (Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience), the work that coined the name of his new science, "electrodynamics", and became known ever after as its founding treatise.

In 1827 Ampère was elected a <a href="Foreign%20Member%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Foreign Member of the Royal Society</a> and in 1828, a foreign member of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Science">Royal Swedish Academy of Science</a>.


In recognition of his contribution to the creation of modern electrical science, an international convention, signed at the 1881 <a href="International%20Exposition%20of%20Electricity">International Exposition of Electricity</a>, established the <a href="Ampere%20%28unit%29">ampere</a> as a standard unit of electrical measurement, along with the <a href="coulomb">coulomb</a>, <a href="volt">volt</a>, <a href="ohm">ohm</a>, and <a href="watt">watt</a>, which are named, respectively, after Ampère's contemporaries <a href="Charles-Augustin%20de%20Coulomb">Charles-Augustin de Coulomb</a> of France, <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a> of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Georg%20Ohm">Georg Ohm</a> of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, and <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a> of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Ampère's name is one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%2072%20names%20on%20the%20Eiffel%20Tower">72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower</a>.

Several items are named after Ampère; many streets and <a href="Place%20Amp%C3%A8re">squares</a>, <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge-lyc%C3%A9e%20Amp%C3%A8re">schools</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20Lyon%20Metro%20stations%23Line%20A">Lyon metro station</a>, and an <a href="Electric%20boat%23Types">electric ferry</a> in Norway.

Ammonia

Ammonia or azane is a <a href="chemical%20compound">compound</a> of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">formula</a> NH. The simplest <a href="pnictogen%20hydride">pnictogen hydride</a>, ammonia is a colourless <a href="gas">gas</a> with a characteristic pungent smell. It contributes significantly to the <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a>al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to <a href="food">food</a> and <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many <a href="pharmaceuticals">pharmaceutical products</a> and is used in many commercial cleaning products.

Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both <a href="Caustic%20%28substance%29">caustic</a> and <a href="hazard">hazard</a>ous in its concentrated form. It is classified as an <a href="List%20of%20extremely%20hazardous%20substances">extremely hazardous substance</a> in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. <a href="Emergency%20Planning%20and%20Community%20Right-to-Know%20Act">Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act</a> (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

The global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was , a 16% increase over the 2006 global industrial production of . Industrial ammonia is sold either as <a href="ammonia%20liquor">ammonia liquor</a> (usually 28% ammonia in water) or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders.

NH boils at at a pressure of one <a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atmosphere</a>, so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> is a solution of NH in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the <a href="Baum%C3%A9%20scale">Baumé scale</a> (<a href="density">density</a>), with 26 degrees baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at ) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.

Ammonia is found in trace quantities in nature, being produced from the nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a> (<a href="sal%20ammoniac">sal ammoniac</a>), and <a href="ammonium%20sulfate">ammonium sulfate</a> are found in volcanic districts; crystals of <a href="ammonium%20bicarbonate">ammonium bicarbonate</a> have been found in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>n <a href="guano">guano</a>. The <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid. Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.

Ammonia is also found throughout the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> on <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>, <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>, and <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>, among other places: on smaller, icy worlds like Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can potentially have a melting point of as low as 173 kelvins if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such worlds to retain internal oceans and active geology far longer than would be possible with water alone. Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called "ammoniacal".

Ammonia is a colourless <a href="gas">gas</a> with a characteristic pungent smell. It is <a href="lighter%20than%20air">lighter than air</a>, its density being 0.589 times that of <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">air</a>. It is easily liquefied due to the strong <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>ing between molecules; the <a href="liquid">liquid</a> boils at , and freezes at to white crystals.

Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a>. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.





The ammonia molecule has a <a href="Trigonal%20pyramid%20%28chemistry%29">trigonal pyramidal</a> shape as predicted by the <a href="valence%20shell%20electron%20pair%20repulsion%20theory">valence shell electron pair repulsion theory</a> (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a <a href="Lone%20pair">lone electron pair</a>, which makes ammonia a <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a <a href="dipole">dipole</a> moment and makes it <a href="Polar%20molecule">polar</a>. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are <a href="Protonation">protonated</a>. Temperature and <a href="salinity">salinity</a> also affect the proportion of NH. The latter has the shape of a regular <a href="tetrahedron">tetrahedron</a> and is <a href="isoelectronic">isoelectronic</a> with <a href="methane">methane</a>.

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes <a href="nitrogen%20inversion">nitrogen inversion</a> at room temperature; a useful analogy is an <a href="umbrella">umbrella</a> turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the <a href="resonance%20frequency">resonance frequency</a> is 23.79 <a href="Hertz">GHz</a>, corresponding to <a href="microwave">microwave</a> radiation of a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 1.260 cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first <a href="Microwave%20spectroscopy">microwave spectrum</a> to be observed.

One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its <a href="basicity">basicity</a>. Ammonia is considered to be a weak base. It combines with <a href="acid">acid</a>s to form <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a>s; thus with <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> it forms <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a> (sal ammoniac); with <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>, <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>, etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a>; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction. As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear "out of nothing" as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the and all contain the <a href="ammonium">ammonium ion</a> (NH).

Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides (which contain the NH ion). For example, <a href="lithium">lithium</a> dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of <a href="lithium%20amide">lithium amide</a>:

Like water, ammonia undergoes <a href="molecular%20autoionisation">molecular autoionisation</a> to form its <a href="conjugate%20acid">acid and base conjugates</a>:

Ammonia often functions as a <a href="weak%20base">weak base</a>, so it has some <a href="buffer%20solution">buffering</a> ability. Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> cations () and amide anions () to be present in <a href="solution">solution</a>. At standard pressure and temperature, K=[][] = 10

The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a>:

The <a href="standard%20enthalpy%20change%20of%20combustion">standard enthalpy change of combustion</a>, Δ"H"°, expressed per <a href="mole%20%28unit%29">mole</a> of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is −382.81 kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all <a href="nitrogen%20oxide">nitrogen oxide</a>s are unstable with respect to N and O, which is the principle behind the <a href="catalytic%20converter">catalytic converter</a>. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>:

A subsequent reaction leads to NO

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as <a href="platinum">platinum</a> gauze or warm <a href="chromium%28III%29%20oxide">chromium(III) oxide</a>), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.

In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, ammonia can act as a <a href="nucleophile">nucleophile</a> in <a href="Nucleophilic%20substitution">substitution</a> reactions. <a href="Amine">Amine</a>s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with <a href="alkyl%20halide">alkyl halide</a>s, although the resulting -NH group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the <a href="hydrogen%20halide">hydrogen halide</a> formed. <a href="Methylamine">Methylamine</a> is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with <a href="chloromethane">chloromethane</a>, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare <a href="racemic">racemic</a> <a href="alanine">alanine</a> in 70% yield. <a href="Ethanolamine">Ethanolamine</a> is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a>: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce <a href="diethanolamine">diethanolamine</a> and <a href="triethanolamine">triethanolamine</a>.

<a href="Amide">Amide</a>s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> derivatives. <a href="Acyl%20chloride">Acyl chloride</a>s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a> formed. <a href="Ester">Ester</a>s and <a href="anhydride">anhydride</a>s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be <a href="Dehydration">dehydrated</a> to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200 °C are required.

The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by <a href="metal">metal</a>s, thus <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> burns in the gas with the formation of <a href="magnesium%20nitride">magnesium nitride</a> MgN, and when the gas is passed over heated <a href="sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, sodamide, NaNH, and potassamide, KNH, are formed. Where necessary in <a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature">substitutive nomenclature</a>, <a href="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> recommendations prefer the name "azane" to ammonia: hence <a href="chloramine">chloramine</a> would be named "chloroazane" in substitutive nomenclature, not "chloroammonia".

Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure, and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.

Ammonia can act as a <a href="ligand">ligand</a> in <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> <a href="complex%20%28chemistry%29">complexes</a>. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the <a href="spectrochemical%20series">spectrochemical series</a>, and shows intermediate <a href="HSAB%20concept">hard-soft</a> behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of <a href="coordination%20compound">coordination compound</a>s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH)(HO)]), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as <a href="Schweizer%27s%20reagent">Schweizer's reagent</a>, and has the remarkable ability to dissolve <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH)]) is the active species in <a href="Tollens%27%20reagent">Tollens' reagent</a>. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: <a href="silver%20chloride">silver chloride</a> (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, <a href="silver%20bromide">silver bromide</a> (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas <a href="silver%20iodide">silver iodide</a> (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.

Ammine complexes of <a href="chromium">chromium</a>(III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of <a href="Alfred%20Werner">Alfred Werner</a>'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers ("fac"- and "mer"-) of the complex [CrCl(NH)] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the <a href="wikt%3Avertex">vertices</a> of an <a href="octahedron">octahedron</a>. This proposal has since been confirmed by <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>.

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the <a href="Mercury%28I%29%20chloride">Calomel reaction</a>, where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.

Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of <a href="Nessler%27s%20solution">Nessler's solution</a>, which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the least trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium</a> or <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> and the excess of acid then determined <a href="volumetric%20analysis">volumetrically</a>; or the ammonia may be absorbed in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as <a href="ammonium%20hexachloroplatinate">ammonium hexachloroplatinate</a>, (NH)PtCl.

<a href="Sulfur%20sticks">Sulfur sticks</a> are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with <a href="calcium%20oxide">quicklime</a>, when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the Permissible Exposure Limit is 25 ppm, and lethal above 500 ppm. Higher concentrations are hardly detected by conventional detectors, the type of detector is chosen according to the sensitivity required (e.g. semiconductor, catalytic, electrochemical). Holographic sensors have been proposed for detecting concentrations up to 12.5% in volume.

<a href="Ammoniacal%20nitrogen">Ammoniacal nitrogen</a> (NH-N) is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> ions, derived naturally from ammonia, and returned to ammonia via organic processes, in water or waste liquids. It is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems, as well as a measure of the health of natural and man made water reserves. It is measured in units of mg/L (<a href="milligram">milligram</a> per <a href="litre">litre</a>).

The ancient Greek historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> mentioned that there were <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s of salt in an area of Libya that was inhabited by a people called the "Ammonians" (now: the <a href="Siwa%20oasis">Siwa oasis</a> in northwestern Egypt, where salt lakes still exist). The Greek geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> also mentioned the salt from this region. However, the ancient authors <a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a>, <a href="Apicius">Apicius</a>, <a href="Arrian">Arrian</a>, <a href="Synesius">Synesius</a>, and <a href="A%C3%ABtius%20of%20Amida">Aëtius of Amida</a> described this salt as forming clear crystals that could be used for cooking and that were essentially <a href="halite">rock salt</a>. "Hammoniacus sal" appears in the writings of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a>, although it is not known whether the term is identical with the more modern sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride).

The fermentation of urine by bacteria produces a <a href="Ammonia%20solution">solution of ammonia</a>; hence fermented urine was used in <a href="Classical%20Antiquity">Classical Antiquity</a> to wash cloth and clothing, to remove hair from hides in preparation for tanning, to serve as a <a href="mordant">mordant</a> in dying cloth, and to remove rust from iron.

In the form of sal ammoniac "(نشادر, nushadir)" ammonia was important to the <a href="Alchemy%20and%20chemistry%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Muslim alchemists</a> as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian chemist <a href="J%C4%81bir%20ibn%20Hayy%C4%81n">Jābir ibn Hayyān</a>, and to the European <a href="Alchemy">alchemists</a> since the 13th century, being mentioned by <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a>. It was also used by <a href="dye">dye</a>rs in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> in the form of fermented <a href="urine">urine</a> to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, <a href="Basilius%20Valentinus">Basilius Valentinus</a> showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal ammoniac. At a later period, when sal ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, the name "spirit of hartshorn" was applied to ammonia.

Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by <a href="Joseph%20Black">Joseph Black</a> in 1756 by reacting "sal ammoniac" (<a href="Ammonium%20Chloride">Ammonium Chloride</a>) with "calcined magnesia" (<a href="Magnesium%20Oxide">Magnesium Oxide</a>). It was isolated again by <a href="Peter%20Woulfe">Peter Woulfe</a> in 1767, by <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a> in 1770 and by <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> in 1773 and was termed by him "alkaline air". Eleven years later in 1785, <a href="Claude%20Louis%20Berthollet">Claude Louis Berthollet</a> ascertained its composition.

The <a href="Haber%E2%80%93Bosch%20process">Haber–Bosch process</a> to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by <a href="Fritz%20Haber">Fritz Haber</a> and <a href="Carl%20Bosch">Carl Bosch</a> in 1909 and patented in 1910. It was first used on an industrial scale in Germany during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain war efforts.

Prior to the availability of natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to <a href="ammonia%20production">ammonia production</a> was produced via the <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of water or using the <a href="chloralkali%20process">chloralkali process</a>.

With the advent of the steel industry in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal.

Globally, approximately 88% (as of 2014) of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously. When applied to soil, it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat. 30% of agricultural nitrogen applied in the USA is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide 110 million tonnes are applied each year.

Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>. This key material is generated via the <a href="Ostwald%20process">Ostwald process</a> by <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of ammonia with air over a <a href="platinum">platinum</a> catalyst at , ~9 atm. <a href="Nitric%20oxide">Nitric oxide</a> is an intermediate in this conversion:
Nitric acid is used for the production of <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, <a href="explosive">explosive</a>s, and many organonitrogen compounds.

Ammonia is also used to make the following compounds:

Ammonia can also be used to make compounds in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: <a href="ammonium%20perchlorate">ammonium perchlorate</a>, <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a>, <a href="formamide">formamide</a>, <a href="dinitrogen%20tetroxide">dinitrogen tetroxide</a>, <a href="alprazolam">alprazolam</a>, <a href="ethanolamine">ethanolamine</a>, <a href="ethyl%20carbamate">ethyl carbamate</a>, <a href="hexamethylenetetramine">hexamethylenetetramine</a>, and <a href="ammonium%20bicarbonate">ammonium bicarbonate</a>.

Household ammonia is a solution of NH in water (i.e., <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a>) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.

Solutions of ammonia ranging from 16% to 25% are used in the <a href="Industrial%20fermentation">fermentation</a> industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation.

As early as in 1895, it was known that ammonia was "strongly <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a> ... it requires 1.4 grams per litre to preserve <a href="beef%20tea">beef tea</a>." In one study, anhydrous ammonia destroyed 99.999% of <a href="zoonotic%20bacteria">zoonotic bacteria</a> in 3 types of <a href="compound%20feed">animal feed</a>, but not <a href="silage">silage</a>. Anhydrous ammonia is currently used commercially to reduce or eliminate <a href="microbial">microbial</a> contamination of <a href="beef">beef</a>.
Lean finely textured beef in the beef industry is made from fatty <a href="beef%20trimmings">beef trimmings</a> (c. 50–70% fat) by removing the fat using heat and <a href="centrifugation">centrifugation</a>, then treating it with ammonia to kill "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>". The process was deemed effective and safe by the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">US Department of Agriculture</a> based on a study that found that the treatment reduces "E. coli" to undetectable levels. There have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia. The level of ammonia in any final product has not come close to toxic levels to humans.

Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful <a href="refrigerant">refrigerant</a>. It was commonly used prior to the popularisation of <a href="chlorofluorocarbon">chlorofluorocarbon</a>s (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high <a href="Energy%20conversion%20efficiency">energy efficiency</a> and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern <a href="vapor-compression%20refrigeration">vapor-compression refrigeration</a> it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in <a href="absorption%20refrigerator">absorption refrigerator</a>s. The <a href="Kalina%20cycle">Kalina cycle</a>, which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.

Ammonia is used to scrub SO from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxides (NO) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR (<a href="selective%20catalytic%20reduction">selective catalytic reduction</a>), relies on a <a href="vanadia">vanadia</a>-based catalyst.
Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of <a href="phosgene">phosgene</a>.

The raw <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L, which is about a third that of <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel</a>. Although it can be used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread.

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a <a href="working%20fluid">working fluid</a>, have been proposed and occasionally used. The principle is similar to that used in a <a href="fireless%20locomotive">fireless locomotive</a>, but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by <a href="Goldsworthy%20Gurney">Goldsworthy Gurney</a> in the UK and the <a href="St.%20Charles%20Avenue%20Streetcar">St. Charles Avenue Streetcar</a> line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s, and during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.

Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> for <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a>s. Its high octane rating of 120 and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production.  Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.

However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing <a href="Otto%20cycle">Otto cycle</a> engines because of its very narrow <a href="Ammonia%23Combustion">flammability range</a> and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage. In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources. Although it is the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage. It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. The 60 MW <a href="Norsk%20Hydro%20Rjukan">Rjukan dam</a> in <a href="Telemark">Telemark</a>, Norway produced ammonia for many years from 1913 producing fertilizer for much of Europe.

Despite this, several tests have been done. In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel. In 2007, a University of Michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from Detroit to San Francisco as part of a demonstration, requiring only one fill-up in Wyoming.

Compared to <a href="hydrogen%20as%20a%20fuel">hydrogen as a fuel</a>, ammonia is much more energy efficient, and it would be a much lower cost to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen as ammonia than as compressed and/or cryogenic hydrogen. The conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium-amide process, either as a catalyst for combustion or as fuel for a <a href="proton%20exchange%20membrane%20fuel%20cell">proton exchange membrane fuel cell</a>, is another possibility.  Conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly 18 wt% compared to ~5% for gaseous hydrogen under pressure.

Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia. The <a href="Reaction%20Motors%20XLR99">Reaction Motors XLR99</a> rocket engine that powered the hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

Ammonia, as the vapor released by <a href="smelling%20salts">smelling salts</a>, has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant. Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> through a <a href="Birch%20reduction">Birch reduction</a>. The Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.

Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, giving properties like <a href="mercerisation">mercerisation</a>, using alkalis. In particular, it is used for prewashing of wool.

At standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere, and has approximately 60% of the lifting power of hydrogen or <a href="helium">helium</a>. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a <a href="lifting%20gas">lifting gas</a>. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an <a href="airship">airship</a> to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

Ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts & Crafts and Mission-style furniture. Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours.

The U. S. <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</a> has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume. NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death. Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons). Household products containing ammonia (i.e., <a href="Windex">Windex</a>) should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach, as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes.

Liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> and because it can freeze flesh. See <a href="Gas%20carrier%23Health%20effects%20of%20specific%20cargoes%20carried%20on%20gas%20carriers">Gas carrier#Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers</a> for more information.

The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to <a href="carbamoyl%20phosphate">carbamoyl phosphate</a> by the enzyme <a href="carbamoyl%20phosphate%20synthetase">carbamoyl phosphate synthetase</a>, and then enters the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a> to be either incorporated into <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s or excreted in the urine . <a href="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is <a href="Directive%2067/548/EEC">classified</a> as "dangerous for the environment".

Ammonia is a constituent of <a href="tobacco%20smoke">tobacco smoke</a>.

Ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams, as a liquid by-product of the production of <a href="Coke%20%28fuel%29">coke</a> from <a href="coal">coal</a>. In some cases, the ammonia is discharged to the <a href="marine%20environment">marine environment</a> where it acts as a pollutant. The <a href="Whyalla%20steelworks">Whyalla steelworks</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> is one example of a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters.

Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.

During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.

Similar to <a href="propane">propane</a>, <a href="anhydrous">anhydrous</a> ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. A storage vessel capable of is suitable to contain the liquid. Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">bases</a> (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, as a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household <a href="bleach">bleach</a>, can lead to hazardous compounds such as <a href="chloramine">chloramine</a>s.

The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: "dilute" ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (<5.62 mol/L); "concentrated" solutions are usually prepared at >25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The <a href="Directive%2067/548/EEC">European Union classification</a> of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated ("0.880" — see <a href="%23Properties">#Properties</a>) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% ("0.900") solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> or <a href="iodide">iodide</a> salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in <a href="qualitative%20inorganic%20analysis">qualitative inorganic analysis</a>, and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (<6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic (T) and dangerous for the environment (N). The gas is flammable (<a href="autoignition%20temperature">autoignition temperature</a>: 651 °C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> (PEL) in the United States is 50 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> (35 mg/m), while the <a href="IDLH">IDLH</a> concentration is estimated at 300 ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50 ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100 ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes <a href="copper">copper</a>- and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>-containing <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s, and so <a href="brass">brass</a> fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack <a href="rubber">rubber</a> and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. <a href="Nitrogen%20triiodide">Nitrogen triiodide</a>, a <a href="primary%20explosive">primary</a> <a href="high%20explosive">high explosive</a>, is formed when ammonia comes in contact with <a href="iodine">iodine</a>. Ammonia causes the explosive <a href="polymerisation">polymerisation</a> of <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a>. It also forms explosive <a href="fulminating">fulminating</a> compounds with compounds of <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, <a href="germanium">germanium</a> or <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a>, and with <a href="stibine">stibine</a>. Violent reactions have also been reported with <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>, <a href="hypochlorite">hypochlorite</a> solutions, <a href="potassium%20ferricyanide">potassium ferricyanide</a> and <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a>s.

Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of <a href="chemical%20plant">chemical plant</a>s worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, <a href="ammonia%20production">ammonia production</a> is a significant component of the world energy budget. The USGS reports global ammonia production in 2014 was 176 million tonnes. China accounted for 32.6% of that (increasingly from coal as part of <a href="urea">urea</a> synthesis), followed by Russia at 8.1%, India at 7.6%, and the United States at 6.4%. About 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops.

Before the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, most ammonia was obtained by the <a href="dry%20distillation">dry distillation</a> of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including <a href="camel">camel</a> <a href="manure">dung</a>, where it was <a href="distillation">distilled</a> by the reduction of <a href="nitrous%20acid">nitrous acid</a> and <a href="nitrite">nitrite</a>s with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of <a href="coal">coal</a>, and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> hydroxides such as <a href="calcium%20oxide">quicklime</a>, the salt most generally used being the chloride (<a href="sal%20ammoniac">sal ammoniac</a>) thus:

Hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the <a href="water%20gas">water gas</a> reaction followed by the <a href="water%20gas%20shift">water gas shift</a> reaction, produced by passing steam through red-hot <a href="coke%20%28fuel%29">coke</a>, to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide "washing" the gas mixture with water under pressure (); or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification.

Modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial <a href="hydrogen%20production">hydrogen production</a> to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> or over a promoted Fe catalyst under high pressure () and temperature (450 °C) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the <a href="Haber%20process">Haber–Bosch process</a>):

Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale.
At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at <a href="Vemork">Vemork</a>, via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.

As a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>, hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste), using <a href="catalytic%20reforming">catalytic reforming</a>. This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming, such as cold-plasma). Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, to take advantage of low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.

It is also easier to store ammonia on board vehicles than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or LPG.

For small scale laboratory synthesis, one can heat <a href="urea">urea</a> and Ca(OH)

Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing <a href="solvated%20electron">solvated electron</a>s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH with those of water shows NH has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>, <a href="dielectric%20constant">dielectric constant</a> and <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a>; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each HO molecule. The ionic self-<a href="dissociation%20constant">dissociation constant</a> of liquid NH at −50 °C is about 10 mol·l.

Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds, including many <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, <a href="nitrite">nitrite</a>s, <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>s, <a href="thiocyanate">thiocyanate</a>s, <a href="Cyclopentadienyl%20complex">metal cyclopentadienyl complexes</a> and <a href="metal%20bis%28trimethylsilyl%29amides">metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides</a>. Most ammonium salts are soluble and act as acids in liquid ammonia solutions. The solubility of <a href="halide">halide</a> salts increases from <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> to <a href="iodide">iodide</a>. A saturated solution of <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> contains 0.83 mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a <a href="vapour%20pressure">vapour pressure</a> of less than 1 bar even at .

Liquid ammonia will dissolve the <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>s and other <a href="Electronegativity">electropositive</a> metals such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="barium">barium</a>, <a href="europium">europium</a> and <a href="ytterbium">ytterbium</a>. At low concentrations (<0.06 mol/l), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and <a href="solvated%20electron">solvated electron</a>s, free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules.

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, <a href="Standard%20electrode%20potential">"E"°</a> (N + 6NH + 6e ⇌ 8NH), is only +0.04 V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the <a href="Amide">metal amide</a> and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

Ammonia is both a <a href="metabolic%20waste">metabolic waste</a> and a metabolic input throughout the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N gas. Therefore, <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">nitrogen fixation</a> is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of <a href="protein">protein</a>. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing <a href="legume">legume</a>s, benefit from <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationships with <a href="rhizobia">rhizobia</a> that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.

In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s called <a href="nitrogenase">nitrogenase</a>s. The overall process is called <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">nitrogen fixation</a>. Although it is unlikely that biomimetic methods that are competitive with the <a href="Haber%20process">Haber process</a> will be developed, intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation. The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an FeMoS ensemble.

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="deamination">deamination</a> catalyzed by enzymes such as <a href="Glutamate%20dehydrogenase%201%23Function">glutamate dehydrogenase 1</a>. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to <a href="urea">urea</a>, which is much less toxic, particularly less <a href="%23Basicity">basic</a>. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of <a href="urine">urine</a>. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> solely as nitrogenous waste.

Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal <a href="physiology">physiology</a>. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The <a href="liver">liver</a> converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a>. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood (<a href="hyperammonemia">hyperammonemia</a>). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as <a href="ornithine%20transcarbamylase">ornithine transcarbamylase</a>, lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and <a href="coma">coma</a> of <a href="hepatic%20encephalopathy">hepatic encephalopathy</a>, as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and <a href="organic%20aciduria">organic aciduria</a>s.

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>, <a href="%CE%B1-ketoglutarate">α-ketoglutarate</a> may be degraded to produce two molecules of <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>, which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.

Ammonium ions are a <a href="Toxicity">toxic</a> waste product of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> in <a href="animal">animal</a>s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a> to <a href="urea">urea</a>, because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a>, which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.

Ammonia has been detected in the atmospheres of the <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a> planets, including <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, along with other gases like methane, hydrogen, and <a href="helium">helium</a>. The interior of Saturn may include frozen crystals of ammonia. It is naturally found on <a href="Deimos%20%28moon%29">Deimos</a> and <a href="Phobos%20%28moon%29">Phobos</a> – the two <a href="moons%20of%20Mars">moons of Mars</a>.

Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on <a href="microwave">microwave</a> emissions from the direction of the <a href="Milky%20Way">galactic core</a>. This was the first <a href="polyatomic">polyatomic</a> molecule to be so detected.
The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of <a href="molecular%20cloud">molecular cloud</a>s. The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:
The detection of triply <a href="deuterium">deuterated</a> ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.

Since its interstellar discovery, NH has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.

The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.

The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH]/[H] ratio has been estimated to range from 10 in small dark clouds up to 10 in the dense core of the <a href="Orion%20Molecular%20Cloud%20Complex">Orion Molecular Cloud Complex</a>. Although a total of 18 total production routes have been proposed, the principal formation mechanism for interstellar NH is the reaction:

The rate constant, "k", of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment, with a value of 5.2×10 at 10 K. The rate constant was calculated from the formula . For the primary formation reaction, and . Assuming an NH abundance of 3×10 and an electron abundance of 10 typical of molecular clouds, the formation will proceed at a rate of in a molecular cloud of total density .

All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant. As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:

has a rate constant of 2.2×10. Assuming H densities of 10 and [NH]/[H] ratio of 10, this reaction proceeds at a rate of 2.2×10, more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above.

Some of the other possible formation reactions are:

There are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of NH. Of these, 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among C, N, and O compounds. A review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms:

with rate constants of 4.39×10 and 2.2×10, respectively. The above equations (, ) run at a rate of 8.8×10 and 4.4×10, respectively. These calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of [NH]/[H] = 10, [H]/[H] = 2×10, [HCO]/[H] = 2×10, and total densities of "n" = 10, typical of cold, dense, molecular clouds. Clearly, between these two primary reactions, equation () is the dominant destruction reaction, with a rate ~10,000 times faster than equation (). This is due to the relatively high abundance of H.

Radio observations of NH from the <a href="Effelsberg%20100-m%20Radio%20Telescope">Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope</a> reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO. The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in <a href="H%20II%20region">H II region</a>s, HNHO <a href="maser">maser</a>s, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.

Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion A</a>, W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.

<a href="Very%20Large%20Array">VLA</a> observations of NH in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 <a href="Parsec">pc</a> in L1551, S140, and <a href="Cepheus%20%28constellation%29">Cepheus A</a>. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.

Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in <a href="IC%20342">IC 342</a>. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO. NH was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.

Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the <a href="Becklin-Neugebauer%20Object">Becklin-Neugebauer Object</a> and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.

A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the <a href="Kuiper%20Airborne%20Observatory">Kuiper Airborne Observatory</a>, covering the 100 to 300 cm spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.

A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.

Ammonia has been detected in the <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco Nebula</a> and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic <a href="infrared%20cirrus">infrared cirrus</a>. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.

By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between <a href="excitation%20temperature">excitation temperature</a> and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10 and 10 cm in dark clouds. Mapping of NH gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 <a href="Parsec">pc</a> and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.

Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.

Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies, and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).

Amethyst

Amethyst is a <a href="violet%20%28color%29">violet</a> variety of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> often used in <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>. 

The name comes from the <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> ἀμέθυστος "amethystos" from ἀ- "a-", "not" and μεθύσκω "methysko" / μεθύω "methyo", "intoxicate", a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from <a href="Alcohol%20intoxication">drunkenness</a>. The <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> wore amethyst and carved <a href="drinking">drinking</a> vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication. 

It is one of several forms of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. Amethyst is a semiprecious stone and is the traditional <a href="birthstone">birthstone</a> for February.

Amethyst is a purple variety of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> (SiO) and owes its violet color to <a href="irradiation">irradiation</a>, iron impurities (in some cases in conjunction with <a href="transition%20metal">transition element</a> impurities), and the presence of trace elements, which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions. The <a href="Mohs%20scale%20of%20mineral%20hardness">hardness</a> of the mineral is the same as quartz, thus it is suitable for use in jewelry.

Amethyst occurs in primary hues from a light pinkish violet to a deep purple. Amethyst may exhibit one or both secondary hues, red and blue. The best varieties of amethyst can be found in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and the far East. The ideal grade is called "Deep Siberian" and has a primary purple hue of around 75–80%, with 15–20% blue and (depending on the light source) red secondary hues. Green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst, which is a misnomer and not an appropriate name for the material, the proper terminology being <a href="prasiolite">prasiolite</a>. Other names for green quartz are vermarine or lime citrine.

Of very variable intensity, the color of amethyst is often laid out in stripes parallel to the final faces of the crystal. One aspect in the art of <a href="lapidary">lapidary</a> involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in a way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous. Often, the fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for a difficult cutting.

The color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by <a href="irradiation">irradiation</a> of trivalent iron (Fe) for silicon in the structure, in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius, and, to a certain extent, the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of <a href="transition%20metal">transition elements</a> even if the iron concentration is low. Natural amethyst is <a href="dichroism">dichroic</a> in reddish violet and bluish violet, but when heated, turns yellow-orange, yellow-brown, or dark brownish and may resemble <a href="Quartz%23Citrine">citrine</a>, but loses its dichroism, unlike genuine citrine. When partially heated, amethyst can result in <a href="ametrine">ametrine</a>.

Amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation.

Amethyst was used as a <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a> by the ancient <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ians and was largely employed in antiquity for <a href="intaglio%20%28jewelry%29">intaglio engraved gems</a>.

The Greeks believed amethyst gems could prevent intoxication, while medieval European soldiers wore amethyst <a href="amulet">amulet</a>s as protection in battle in the belief that amethysts heal people and keep them cool-headed. Beads of amethyst were found in <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> graves in England. <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> bishops wear an <a href="ecclesiastical%20ring">episcopal ring</a> often set with an amethyst, an allusion to the description of the Apostles as "not drunk" at <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> in Acts 2:15.

A large <a href="geode">geode</a>, or "amethyst-grotto", from near Santa Cruz in southern <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> was presented at a 1902 exhibition in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, Germany.

In the 19th century, the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of <a href="manganese">manganese</a>. However, since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat, the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source. <a href="Iron">Ferric</a> <a href="thiocyanate">thiocyanate</a> has been suggested, and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> was said to have been detected in the mineral.

Synthetic (laboratory-grown) amethyst is produced by a synthesis method called hydrothermal growth, which grows the crystals inside a high-pressure autoclave.

Synthetic amethyst is made to imitate the best quality amethyst. Its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural amethyst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing (which is often cost-prohibitive). There is one test based on "Brazil law twinning" (a form of <a href="Crystal%20twinning">quartz twinning</a> where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal) which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily. It is possible to synthesize twinned amethyst, but this type is not available in large quantities in the market.

Single-crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry, particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks, which is where a lot of synthetic quartz is used.

Treated amethyst is produced by <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>, <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> or electron beam irradiation of clear quartz (<a href="rock%20crystal">rock crystal</a>) which has been first doped with ferric impurities. On exposure to heat, the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green, and much of the <a href="citrine">citrine</a>, <a href="Cairngorm%20%28mineral%29">cairngorm</a>, or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely "burnt amethyst".

The Greek word "amethystos" may be translated as "not drunken", from Greek "a-", "not" + "methustos", "intoxicated". Amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness, which is why wine goblets were often carved from it. In his poem "L'Amethyste, ou les Amours de Bacchus et d'Amethyste" (Amethyst or the loves of Bacchus and Amethyste), the French poet <a href="Remy%20Belleau">Remy Belleau</a> (1528–1577) invented a myth in which <a href="Bacchus">Bacchus</a>, the god of intoxication, of wine, and grapes was pursuing a maiden named Amethyste, who refused his affections. Amethyste prayed to the gods to remain chaste, a prayer which the chaste goddess <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> answered, transforming her into a white stone. Humbled by Amethyste's desire to remain chaste, Bacchus poured wine over the stone as an offering, dyeing the crystals purple.

Variations of the story include that Dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path, creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath. The mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman, Amethystos, who was on her way to pay tribute to <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. Her life was spared by Artemis, who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws. Dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue. The god's tears then stained the quartz purple.

This myth and its variations are not found in classical sources. However, the titan <a href="Rhea%20%28mythology%29">Rhea</a> does present Dionysus with an amethyst stone to preserve the wine-drinker's sanity in historical text.

Tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the Buddha and make prayer beads from it. Amethyst is considered the birthstone of <a href="February">February</a>. In the Middle Ages, it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate English regalia. In the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>, amethyst was considered one of the <a href="Cardinal%20gem">Cardinal gem</a>s, in that it was one of the five gemstones considered precious above all others, until large deposits were found in Brazil.

Amethyst is produced in abundance from the state of <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> in Brazil where it occurs in large <a href="geode">geode</a>s within <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a>s. Many of the hollow agates of southwestern <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior. <a href="Artigas%2C%20Uruguay">Artigas, Uruguay</a> and neighboring Brazilian state <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> are large world producers exceeding in <a href="quantity">quantity</a> <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, as well as <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a>, <a href="Espirito%20Santo">Espirito Santo</a>, <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, and <a href="Cear%C3%A1">Ceará</a> states, all amethyst producers of importance in Brazil.

It is also found and mined in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>. The largest opencast amethyst vein in the world is in <a href="Maissau">Maissau</a>, Lower <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. Much fine amethyst comes from <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, especially from near Mursinka in the <a href="Ekaterinburg">Ekaterinburg</a> district, where it occurs in <a href="Druse%20%28geology%29">drusy</a> cavities in <a href="granitic">granitic</a> <a href="rocks">rocks</a>. Many localities in south <a href="India">India</a> yield amethyst. One of the largest global amethyst producers is <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> in southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a> with an annual production of about 1000 tons.

Amethyst occurs at many localities in the United States. Among these may be mentioned: the <a href="Mazatzal%20Mountain">Mazatzal Mountain</a> region in <a href="Gila%20County%2C%20Arizona">Gila</a> and <a href="Maricopa%20County%2C%20Arizona">Maricopa Counties</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>; Red Feather Lakes, near Ft Collins, Colorado; Amethyst Mountain, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>; <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>; <a href="Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Delaware County, Pennsylvania</a>; <a href="Haywood%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Haywood County, North Carolina</a>; Deer Hill and Stow, <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and in the <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> region of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. Amethyst is relatively common in the Canadian provinces of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. The largest amethyst mine in North America is located in <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a>, Ontario.

Up until the 18th century, amethyst was included in the <a href="Cardinal%20gem">cardinal</a>, or most valuable, gemstones (along with diamond, <a href="sapphire">sapphire</a>, <a href="ruby">ruby</a>, and <a href="emerald">emerald</a>). However, since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as Brazil, it has lost most of its value.

Collectors look for depth of color, possibly with red flashes if cut conventionally. As amethyst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by carat weight; this is different to most gemstones where the carat weight exponentially increases the value of the stone. The biggest factor in the value of amethyst is the color displayed.

The highest grade amethyst (called "Deep Russian") is exceptionally rare and therefore, when one is found, its value is dependent on the demand of collectors. It is, however, still orders of magnitude lower than the highest grade sapphires or rubies (padparadscha sapphire or "pigeon's blood" ruby).

Albertosaurus

Albertosaurus (; meaning "Alberta lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s that lived in western North America during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 70 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, "A. sarcophagus", was apparently restricted in <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> to the modern-day <a href="Canadian%20province">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, after which the genus is named. Scientists disagree on the content of the genus, with some recognizing "<a href="Gorgosaurus%20libratus">Gorgosaurus libratus</a>" as a second species.

As a tyrannosaurid, "Albertosaurus" was a <a href="biped">biped</a>al <a href="predator">predator</a> with tiny, two-fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may have been at the top of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> in its local <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. While "Albertosaurus" was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative "Tyrannosaurus rex", growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.

Since the first discovery in 1884, <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of more than 30 individuals have been recovered, providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of "Albertosaurus" anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids. The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of <a href="pack%20hunter">pack</a> behaviour and allows studies of <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> and <a href="population%20biology">population biology</a>, which are impossible with lesser-known dinosaurs.

"Albertosaurus" was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids, such as "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>" and "Tyrannosaurus". Typical "Albertosaurus" adults measured up to long, while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over long. Several independent mass estimates, obtained by different methods, suggest that an adult "Albertosaurus" weighed between 1.3 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s and 1.7 tonnes (1.9 tons).

"Albertosaurus" shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids. Typically for a theropod, "Albertosaurus" was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and <a href="torso">torso</a> with a long tail. However, tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits. The hind limbs were long and ended in a four-toed foot on which the first digit, called the <a href="hallux">hallux</a>, was short and did not reach the ground. The third digit was longer than the rest. "Albertosaurus" may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14−21 km/hour (8−13 mi/hour). At least for the younger individuals, a high running speed is plausible.

The massive <a href="skull">skull</a> of "Albertosaurus", which was perched on a short, S-shaped neck, was about long in the largest adults. Wide openings in the skull (<a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a>) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for <a href="muscle">muscle</a> attachment and <a href="sensory%20organ">sensory organ</a>s. Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>" at least 62. Unlike most theropods, "Albertosaurus" and other tyrannosaurids were <a href="heterodont">heterodont</a>, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry teeth at the tip of the upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in <a href="cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross section</a>. Like with "Tyrannosaurus", the maxillary (cheek) teeth of "Albertosaurus" were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of "Albertosaurus" was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.

<a href="William%20Abler">William Abler</a> observed in 2001 that "Albertosaurus" <a href="tooth%20serrations">tooth serrations</a> resemble a <a href="Fracture">crack</a> in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla. Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling flesh off a body, so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat, the tension could cause a purely crack-like serration to spread through the tooth. However, the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>, and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain. The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering. Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to, as Abler describes, "impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity" to wood they work. The use of a <a href="drill">drill</a> to create an "ampulla" of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces. Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called "kerfs" and drilled holes was more than 25% stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions. Unlike tyrannosaurs, ancient predators like <a href="phytosaur">phytosaur</a>s and "<a href="Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a>" had no adaptations to prevent the crack-like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding.

"Albertosaurus" was named by <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> in a one-page note at the end of his 1905 description of "Tyrannosaurus rex". The name honours <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, the <a href="Canadian%20province">Canadian province</a> established the same year, in which the first remains were found. The generic name also incorporates the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> term "σαυρος"/"sauros" ("lizard"), the most common suffix in dinosaur names. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> is "Albertosaurus sarcophagus"; the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is derived from Ancient Greek σαρκοφάγος ("sarkophagos") meaning "flesh-eating" and having the same <a href="etymology">etymology</a> as the <a href="sarcophagus">funeral container</a> with which it shares its name: a combination of the Greek words σαρξ/"sarx" ("flesh") and φαγειν/"phagein" ("to eat"). More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science.

The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> is a partial skull, collected in the summer of 1884 from an <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a> of the <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a> alongside the <a href="Red%20Deer%20River">Red Deer River</a>, in Alberta. This specimen, found on June 9, 1884, was recovered by an expedition of the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a>, led by the famous <a href="geologist">geologist</a> <a href="Joseph%20Tyrrell">Joseph Burr Tyrrell</a>. Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured. In 1889, Tyrrell's colleague <a href="Thomas%20Chesmer%20Weston">Thomas Chesmer Weston</a> found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby. The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species "Laelaps incrassatus" by <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> in 1892, although the name "Laelaps" was <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">preoccupied</a> by a genus of <a href="mite">mite</a> and had been changed to "<a href="Dryptosaurus">Dryptosaurus</a>" in 1877 by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>. Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh. However, <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> used the name "Dryptosaurus incrassatus" instead of "Laelaps incrassatus" when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904, a combination first coined by <a href="Oliver%20Perry%20Hay">Oliver Perry Hay</a> in 1902. Shortly later, Osborn pointed out that "D. incrassatus" was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth, so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species. The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of "D. aquilunguis", type species of "Dryptosaurus", so Osborn created the new name "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" for them in 1905. He did not describe the remains in any great detail, citing Lambe's complete description the year before. Both specimens (the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> CMN 5600 and the <a href="paratype">paratype</a> CMN 5601) are stored in the <a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">Canadian Museum of Nature</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. By the early twenty-first century, some concerns had arisen that, due to the damaged state of the holotype, "Albertosaurus" might be a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>", a "dubious name" that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it. However, in 2010, <a href="Thomas%20Carr%20%28paleontologist%29">Thomas Carr</a> established that the holotype, the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphy</a>: the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the <a href="palatine%20bone">palatine bone</a>, proving that "Albertosaurus" was a valid <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

On 11 August 1910, American paleontologist <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> discovered the remains of a large group of "Albertosaurus" at another <a href="quarry">quarry</a> alongside the Red Deer River. Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available, Brown's party did not collect every specimen, but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the <a href="bonebed">bonebed</a>. Among the bones deposited in the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> collections in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> are seven sets of right <a href="metatarsal">metatarsal</a>s, along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size. This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry. The <a href="Royal%20Tyrrell%20Museum%20of%20Palaeontology">Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology</a> rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site, which is now located inside <a href="Dry%20Island%20Buffalo%20Jump%20Provincial%20Park">Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park</a>. Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of 13 more individuals of various ages, including a diminutive two-year-old and a very old individual estimated at over in length. None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons, and most are represented by remains in both museums. Excavations continued until 2008, when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at 12, on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton, and at 26 if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>. A total of 1,128 "Albertosaurus" bones had been secured, the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous.

In 1913, <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Hazelius%20Sternberg">Charles H. Sternberg</a> recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> in Alberta. Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a> libratus" in 1914. Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Finding, largely due to a lack of good "Albertosaurus" skull material, no significant differences to separate the two taxa, <a href="Dale%20Russell">Dale Russell</a> declared the name "Gorgosaurus" a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Albertosaurus", which had been named first, and "G. libratus" was renamed "Albertosaurus libratus" in 1970. A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference. This addition extended the temporal range of the genus "Albertosaurus" backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres.

In 2003, <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a>, benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are <a href="sister%20taxa">sister taxa</a>, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that "Albertosaurus" and "Gorgosaurus" be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than "Daspletosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus", which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and Currie suggested that the "Albertosaurus"-"Gorgosaurus" situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.

In 1911, Barnum Brown, during the second year of American Museum of Natural History operations in Alberta, uncovered a fragmentary partial "Albertosaurus" skull at the Red Deer River near Tolman Bridge, specimen AMNH 5222.

<a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a> described a new species in 1928, "Albertosaurus arctunguis", based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by Gus Lindblad and Ralph Hornell near the Red Deer River in 1923, but this species has been considered identical to "A. sarcophagus" since 1970. Parks' specimen (ROM 807) is housed in the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

Between 1926 and 1972, no "Albertosaurus" fossils were found at all; but, since the seventies, there has been a steady increase in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, but these probably do not represent "A. sarcophagus" and may not even belong to the genus "Albertosaurus".

Apart from "A. sarcophagus", "A. arctunguis" and "A. libratus", several other species of "Albertosaurus" have been named. All of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as "nomina dubia", and are not assigned to "Albertosaurus".

In 1930, <a href="Anatoly%20Nikolaevich%20Riabinin">Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin</a> named "Albertosaurus pericolosus" based on a tooth from China, that probably belonged to "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>". In 1932, <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Huene">Friedrich von Huene</a> renamed "Dryptosaurus incrassatus", not considered a "nomen dubium" by him, to "Albertosaurus incrassatus". Because he had identified "Gorgosaurus" with "Albertosaurus", in 1970, Russell also renamed "Gorgosaurus sternbergi" (Matthew & Brown 1922) into "Albertosaurus sternbergi" and "Gorgosaurus lancensis" (Gilmore 1946) into "Albertosaurus lancensis". The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of "Gorgosaurus libratus", the latter as either identical to "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" or representing a separate genus "<a href="Nanotyrannus">Nanotyrannus</a>". In 1988, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> based "Albertosaurus megagracilis" on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton, specimen LACM 28345, from the <a href="Hell%20Creek%20Formation">Hell Creek Formation</a> of Montana. It was renamed "<a href="Dinotyrannus">Dinotyrannus</a>" in 1995, but is now thought to represent a juvenile "Tyrannosaurus rex". Also in 1988, Paul renamed "<a href="Alectrosaurus">Alectrosaurus</a> olseni" (Gilmore 1933) into "Albertosaurus olseni"; this has found no general acceptance. In 1989, "Gorgosaurus novojilovi" (Maleev 1955) was renamed by <a href="Bryn%20Mader">Bryn Mader</a> and Robert Bradley as "Albertosaurus novojilovi"; today this is seen as a synonym of "Tarbosaurus".

On two occasions, species based on valid "Albertosaurus" material were reassigned to a different genus: in 1922 <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> renamed "A. sarcophagus" into "<a href="Deinodon">Deinodon</a> sarcophagus" and in 1939 German paleontologist <a href="Oskar%20Kuhn">Oskar Kuhn</a> renamed "A. arctunguis" into "Deinodon arctunguis".

"Albertosaurus" is a member of the theropod <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. Its closest relative is the slightly older "Gorgosaurus libratus" (sometimes called "Albertosaurus libratus"; see below). These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist. <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Holtz</a> found "<a href="Appalachiosaurus">Appalachiosaurus</a>" to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with other authors.

The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>", "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>" and "Tyrannosaurus". Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (<a href="tibia">tibia</a>) and feet (<a href="metatarsal">metatarsal</a>s and <a href="phalanges">phalanges</a>).

Below is the cladogram of the Tyrannosauridae based on the <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a> conducted by Loewen "et al." in 2013.

Most age categories of "Albertosaurus" are represented in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a>. Using bone <a href="histology">histology</a>, the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined, allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species. The youngest known "Albertosaurus" is a two-year-old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed, which would have weighed about 50 kilograms (110 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>) and measured slightly more than in length. The specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known, at 28 years of age. When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph, an "S"-shaped growth curve results, with the most rapid growth occurring in a four-year period ending around the sixteenth year of life, a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The growth rate during this phase was per year, based on an adult 1.3 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. Other studies have suggested higher adult weights; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate, but not the overall pattern. Tyrannosaurids similar in size to "Albertosaurus" had similar growth rates, although the much larger "Tyrannosaurus rex" grew at almost five times this rate ( per year) at its peak. The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> in "Albertosaurus", although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals' lives. Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s. This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds, which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing.

During growth, through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.

Most known "Albertosaurus" individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly <a href="preservation%20bias">preservation bias</a>, where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young "Albertosaurus" are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life history</a>, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile "Albertosaurus" are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.

A hypothesis of "Albertosaurus" life history postulates that <a href="hatchling">hatchling</a>s died in large numbers, but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction. After just two years, juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult "Albertosaurus", and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains. Mortality rates doubled at age twelve, perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase, and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood, perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation, including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources, and eventually, the ever-increasing effects of <a href="senescence">senescence</a>. The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation. Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes. High infant mortality rates, followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity, with very few animals reaching maximum size, is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals, including elephants, <a href="African%20buffalo">African buffalo</a>, and <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>. The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids. The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis, but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role, especially since more than two-thirds of all "Albertosaurus" specimens are known from one locality.

The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 "Albertosaurus", the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod, and the second-most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>" assemblage at the <a href="Cleveland-Lloyd%20Dinosaur%20Quarry">Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry</a> in <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. The group seems to be composed of one very old adult; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old; seven sub-adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years, who had not yet reached the growth phase.

The near-absence of <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a> remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the "Albertosaurus" bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="California">California</a>, and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time. Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour. Other scientists are skeptical, observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought, flood or for other reasons.

There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs, including <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>ns and <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a>s. However, only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site. Small theropods like "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>" and "<a href="Coelophysis">Coelophysis</a>" have been found in aggregations, as have larger predators like "Allosaurus" and "<a href="Mapusaurus">Mapusaurus</a>". There is some evidence of <a href="gregarious%20behaviour">gregarious behaviour</a> in other tyrannosaurids as well. Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside "<a href="Sue%20%28dinosaur%29">Sue</a>", the "Tyrannosaurus" mounted in the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and a bonebed in the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> of Montana contains at least three specimens of "Daspletosaurus", preserved alongside several hadrosaurs. These findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in "Albertosaurus", although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations. Others have speculated that instead of social groups, at least some of these finds represent <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>-like mobbing of carcasses, where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and <a href="cannibal">cannibal</a>ized.

Currie also offers speculation on the pack-hunting habits of "Albertosaurus". The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of <a href="ornithomimid">ornithomimid</a>s, which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs. Younger "Albertosaurus" were probably equally fleet-footed, or at least faster than their prey. Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults, who were larger and more powerful, but also slower. Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator <a href="Ecological%20niche">niche</a>s between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> smaller than adult "Albertosaurus" in mass. A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons, with hatchlings beginning life as small <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands. However, as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested. In 2010, Currie, though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis, admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes, such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood.

In 2009, researchers hypothesized that smooth-edged holes found in the fossil jaws of <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> dinosaurs such as "Albertosaurus" were caused by a parasite similar to "<a href="Trichomonas">Trichomonas</a> gallinae", which infects birds. They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other, and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food.

In 2001, <a href="Bruce%20Rothschild">Bruce Rothschild</a> and others published a study examining evidence for <a href="stress%20fractures">stress fractures</a> and <a href="tendon%20avulsions">tendon avulsions</a> in <a href="theropod">theropod</a> dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. They found that only one of the 319 "Albertosaurus" foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did. The scientists found that stress fractures were "significantly" less common in "Albertosaurus" than in the <a href="carnosaur">carnosaur</a> "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". ROM 807, the holotype of "A. arctunguis" (now referred to "A. sarcophagus"), had a deep hole in the <a href="iliac%20blade">iliac blade</a>, although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological. The specimen also contains some <a href="exostosis">exostosis</a> on the fourth left metatarsal. In 1970, two of the five "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" specimens with humeri were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them.

In 2010, the health of the Dry Island "Albertosaurus" assembly was reported upon. Most specimens showed no sign of disease. On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs, consisting of abnormal ossifications of the tendons, so-called <a href="enthesophyte">enthesophyte</a>s, were present, their cause unknown. Two ribs and a belly-rib showed signs of breaking and healing. One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks. The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a "<a href="Majungasaurus">Majungasaurus</a>" population of which it in 2007 was established that 19% of individuals showed bone pathologies.

All identifiable fossils of "Albertosaurus sarcophagus" are known from the upper <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a> in Alberta. These younger units of this <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> date to the early <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> stage of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> Period, 70 to 68 <a href="Mega-annum">Ma</a> (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the <a href="Bearpaw%20Shale">Bearpaw Shale</a>, a <a href="Marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> formation representing a section of the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, <a href="estuary">estuaries</a> and <a href="tidal%20flat">tidal flat</a>s. Numerous <a href="coal">coal</a> seams represent ancient <a href="peat">peat</a> <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s. Like most of the other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fossils from the formation, "Albertosaurus" remains are found in deposits laid down in the <a href="river%20delta">deltas</a> and <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.

The <a href="fauna">fauna</a> of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. <a href="Shark">Shark</a>s, <a href="Batoidea">rays</a>, <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>s, <a href="bowfin">bowfin</a>s, <a href="gar">gar</a>s and the gar-like "<a href="Aspidorhynchus">Aspidorhynchus</a>" made up the fish fauna. Mammals included <a href="multituberculate">multituberculate</a>s and the <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> "<a href="Didelphodon">Didelphodon</a>". The saltwater <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a> "<a href="Leurospondylus">Leurospondylus</a>" has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s, "<a href="Champsosaurus">Champsosaurus</a>", and <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns like "<a href="Leidyosuchus">Leidyosuchus</a>" and "<a href="Stangerochampsa">Stangerochampsa</a>". Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera "<a href="Edmontosaurus">Edmontosaurus</a>", "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>" and "<a href="Hypacrosaurus">Hypacrosaurus</a>". Ceratopsians and <a href="ornithomimid">ornithomimid</a>s were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer <a href="ankylosauria">ankylosauria</a>ns and <a href="pachycephalosaur">pachycephalosaur</a>s, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s, <a href="dromaeosaurid">dromaeosaurid</a>s, and <a href="caenagnathid">caenagnathid</a>s. Intermingled with the "Albertosaurus" remains of the Dry Island bonebed, the bones of the small theropod "<a href="Albertonykus">Albertonykus</a>" were found. Adult "Albertosaurus" were the <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.

<doc id="1368" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1368" title="Assembly language">
Assembly language

An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a <a href="low-level%20programming%20language">low-level programming language</a> for a <a href="computer">computer</a>, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not <a href="bijection">one-to-one</a>) correspondence between the language and the <a href="computer%20architecture">architecture's</a> <a href="machine%20code">machine code</a> <a href="Instruction%20set%20architecture">instructions</a>. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture. In contrast, most <a href="high-level%20programming%20language">high-level programming language</a>s are generally <a href="porting">portable</a> across multiple architectures but require <a href="Interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreting</a> or <a href="Compiler">compiling</a>. Assembly language may also be called "symbolic machine code".

Assembly language is converted into executable machine code by a <a href="utility%20software">utility program</a> referred to as an "<a href="%23Assembler">assembler</a>". The conversion process is referred to as "assembly", or "assembling" the <a href="source%20code">source code</a>. "Assembly time" is the computational step where an assembler is run.

Assembly language uses a <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> to represent each low-level <a href="machine%20code">machine instruction</a> or <a href="opcode">opcode</a>, typically also each <a href="register%20%28computing%29%23ARCHITECTURAL">architectural register</a>, <a href="bit%20field">flag</a>, etc. Many operations require one or more <a href="operand%23Computer%20science">operands</a> in order to form a complete instruction and most assemblers can take <a href="expression%20%28computer%20science%29">expression</a>s of numbers and named constants as well as registers and <a href="Label%20%28computer%20science%29">labels</a> as operands, freeing the programmer from tedious repetitive calculations. Depending on the architecture, these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or <a href="addressing%20mode">addressing mode</a>s using <a href="offset%20%28computer%20science%29">offset</a>s or other data as well as fixed addresses. Many assemblers offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development, to control the assembly process, and to aid <a href="debugging">debugging</a>.


An assembler program creates <a href="object%20code">object code</a> by translating combinations of mnemonics and <a href="syntax">syntax</a> for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an "operation code" ("<a href="opcode">opcode</a>") as well as other control <a href="bit">bit</a>s and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves <a href="identifier">symbolic names</a> for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include <a href="Macro%20%28computer%20science%29">macro</a> facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as <a href="inline%20expansion">inline</a>, instead of "called" <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a>s.

Some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of <a href="instruction%20set">instruction set</a>-specific <a href="Compiler%20optimization">optimizations</a>. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous <a href="x86">x86</a> assemblers from various vendors. Most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for <a href="RISC">RISC</a> <a href="Instruction%20set%20architecture">architectures</a> that can help optimize a sensible <a href="instruction%20scheduling">instruction scheduling</a> to exploit the <a href="CPU%20pipeline">CPU pipeline</a> as efficiently as possible.

Like early programming languages such as <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="ALGOL">Algol</a>, <a href="Cobol">Cobol</a> and <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>, assemblers have been available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based <a href="computer%20interface">computer interface</a>s. However, assemblers came first as they are far simpler to write than <a href="compiler">compiler</a>s for <a href="high-level%20language">high-level language</a>s. This is because each mnemonic along with the addressing modes and operands of an instruction translates rather directly into the numeric representations of that particular instruction, without much context or analysis. There have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic <a href="code%20generator">code generator</a>s with properties similar to both assembly and <a href="high%20level%20language">high level language</a>s, with <a href="speedcode">speedcode</a> as perhaps one of the better known examples.

There may be several assemblers with different <a href="Syntax%20%28programming%20languages%29">syntax</a> for a particular <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> or <a href="instruction%20set%20architecture">instruction set architecture</a>. For instance, an instruction to add memory data to a register in a <a href="x86">x86</a>-family processor might be codice_1, in original "<a href="Intel%20syntax">Intel syntax</a>", whereas this would be written codice_2 in the "<a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20syntax">AT&T syntax</a>" used by the <a href="GNU%20Assembler">GNU Assembler</a>. Despite different appearances, different syntactic forms generally generate the same numeric <a href="machine%20code">machine code</a>, see further below. A single assembler may also have different modes in order to support variations in syntactic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations (such as <a href="FASM">FASM</a>-syntax, <a href="TASM">TASM</a>-syntax, ideal mode etc., in the special case of <a href="X86%20assembly%20language">x86 assembly</a> programming).

There are two types of assemblers based on how many passes through the source are needed (how many times the assembler reads the source) to produce the object file.
In both cases, the assembler must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols. This means that if the size of an operation referring to an operand defined later depends on the type or distance of the operand, the assembler will make a pessimistic estimate when first encountering the operation, and if necessary pad it with one or more "<a href="NOP">no-operation</a>" instructions in a later pass or the errata. In an assembler with <a href="peephole%20optimization">peephole optimization</a>, addresses may be recalculated between passes to allow replacing pessimistic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target.

The original reason for the use of one-pass assemblers was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require rewinding and rereading the program source on <a href="Magnetic%20tape%20data%20storage">tape</a> or rereading a deck of <a href="Punch%20cards">cards</a> or <a href="Punched%20tape">punched paper tape</a>. Later computers with much larger memories (especially disc storage), had the space to perform all necessary processing without such re-reading. The advantage of the multi-pass assembler is that the absence of errata makes the <a href="Linker%20%28computing%29">linking process</a> (or the <a href="Loader%20%28computing%29">program load</a> if the assembler directly produces executable code) faster.

Example: in the following code snippet a one-pass assembler would be able to determine the address of the backward reference BKWD when assembling statement S2, but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference FWD when assembling the branch statement S1; indeed FWD may be undefined. A two-pass assembler would determine both addresses in pass 1, so they would be known when generating code in pass 2,

More sophisticated <a href="high-level%20assembler">high-level assembler</a>s provide language abstractions such as:
See <a href="%23Language%20design">Language design</a> below for more details.

A program written in assembly language consists of a series of (mnemonic) processor instructions and meta-statements (known variously as directives, pseudo-instructions and pseudo-ops), comments and data. Assembly language instructions usually consist of an <a href="opcode">opcode</a> mnemonic followed by a list of data, arguments or parameters. These are translated by an <a href="Assembly%20language%20assembler">assembler</a> into <a href="machine%20language">machine language</a> instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed.

For example, the instruction below tells an <a href="x86">x86</a>/<a href="IA-32">IA-32</a> processor to move an <a href="Constant%20%28programming%29">immediate 8-bit value</a> into a <a href="processor%20register">register</a>. The binary code for this instruction is 10110 followed by a 3-bit identifier for which register to use. The identifier for the "AL" register is 000, so the following <a href="machine%20code">machine code</a> loads the "AL" register with the data 01100001.
This binary computer code can be made more human-readable by expressing it in <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> as follows.
Here, codice_3 means 'Move a copy of the following value into "AL"', and codice_4 is a hexadecimal representation of the value 01100001, which is 97 in <a href="decimal">decimal</a>. Assembly language for the 8086 family provides the <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> <a href="MOV%20%28x86%20instruction%29">MOV</a> (an abbreviation of "move") for instructions such as this, so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language, complete with an explanatory comment if required, after the semicolon. This is much easier to read and to remember.
MOV AL, 61h ; Load AL with 97 decimal (61 hex)

In some assembly languages the same mnemonic such as MOV may be used for a family of related instructions for loading, copying and moving data, whether these are immediate values, values in registers, or memory locations pointed to by values in registers. Other assemblers may use separate opcode mnemonics such as L for "move memory to register", ST for "move register to memory", LR for "move register to register", MVI for "move immediate operand to memory", etc.

The x86 opcode 10110000 (codice_3) copies an 8-bit value into the "AL" register, while 10110001 (codice_6) moves it into "CL" and 10110010 (codice_7) does so into "DL". Assembly language examples for these follow.

MOV AL, 1h ; Load AL with immediate value 1
MOV CL, 2h ; Load CL with immediate value 2
MOV DL, 3h ; Load DL with immediate value 3

The syntax of MOV can also be more complex as the following examples show.

MOV EAX, [EBX] ; Move the 4 bytes in memory at the address contained in EBX into EAX
MOV [ESI+EAX], CL ; Move the contents of CL into the byte at address ESI+EAX

In each case, the MOV mnemonic is translated directly into an opcode in the ranges 88-8E, A0-A3, B0-B8, C6 or C7 by an assembler, and the programmer does not have to know or remember which.

Transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assembler, and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a <a href="disassembler">disassembler</a>. Unlike <a href="high-level%20language">high-level language</a>s, there is a <a href="one-to-one%20correspondence">one-to-one correspondence</a> between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. However, in some cases, an assembler may provide "pseudoinstructions" (essentially macros) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality. For example, for a machine that lacks a "branch if greater or equal" instruction, an assembler may provide a pseudoinstruction that expands to the machine's "set if less than" and "branch if zero (on the result of the set instruction)". Most full-featured assemblers also provide a rich <a href="macro%20%28computer%20science%29">macro</a> language (discussed below) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences.

Each <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a> has its own machine language. Computers differ in the number and type of operations they support, in the different sizes and numbers of registers, and in the representations of data in storage. While most general-purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality, the ways they do so differ; the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences.

Multiple sets of <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a>s or assembly-language syntax may exist for a single instruction set, typically instantiated in different assembler programs. In these cases, the most popular one is usually that supplied by the manufacturer and used in its documentation.

There is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemblers categorize statements and in the nomenclature that they use. In particular, some describe anything other than a machine mnemonic or extended mnemonic as a pseudo-operation (pseudo-op). A typical assembly language consists of 3 types of instruction statements that are used to define program operations:

Instructions (statements) in assembly language are generally very simple, unlike those in <a href="high-level%20programming%20language">high-level languages</a>. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic name for a single executable machine language instruction (an <a href="opcode">opcode</a>), and there is at least one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an "operation" or "opcode" plus zero or more "<a href="operand">operand</a>s". Most instructions refer to a single value, or a pair of values. Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. "Extended mnemonics" are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use as an extended mnemonic for with a mask of 15 and ("NO OPeration" – do nothing for one step) for with a mask of 0.

"Extended mnemonics" are often used to support specialized uses of instructions, often for purposes not obvious from the instruction name. For example, many CPU's do not have an explicit NOP instruction, but do have instructions that can be used for the purpose. In 8086 CPUs the instruction is used for , with being a pseudo-opcode to encode the instruction . Some disassemblers recognize this and will decode the instruction as . Similarly, IBM assemblers for <a href="IBM%20System/360">System/360</a> and <a href="IBM%20System/370">System/370</a> use the extended mnemonics and for and with zero masks. For the SPARC architecture, these are known as "synthetic instructions".

Some assemblers also support simple built-in macro-instructions that generate two or more machine instructions. For instance, with some Z80 assemblers the instruction is recognized to generate followed by . These are sometimes known as "pseudo-opcodes".

Mnemonics are arbitrary symbols; in 1985 the <a href="IEEE">IEEE</a> published Standard 694 for a uniform set of mnemonics to be used by all assemblers. The standard has since been withdrawn.

There are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables. They define the type of data, the length and the <a href="data%20structure%20alignment">alignment</a> of data. These instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs (programs assembled separately) or only to the program in which the data section is defined. Some assemblers classify these as pseudo-ops.

Assembly directives, also called pseudo-opcodes, pseudo-operations or pseudo-ops, are commands given to an assembler "directing it to perform operations other than assembling instructions.". Directives affect how the assembler operates and "may affect the object code, the symbol table, the listing file, and the values of internal assembler parameters." Sometimes the term "pseudo-opcode" is reserved for directives that generate object code, such as those that generate data.

The names of pseudo-ops often start with a dot to distinguish them from machine instructions. Pseudo-ops can make the assembly of the program dependent on parameters input by a programmer, so that one program can be assembled different ways, perhaps for different applications. Or, a pseudo-op can be used to manipulate presentation of a program to make it easier to read and maintain. Another common use of pseudo-ops is to reserve storage areas for run-time data and optionally initialize their contents to known values.

Symbolic assemblers let programmers associate arbitrary names ("<a href="label%20%28programming%20language%29">label</a>s" or "symbols") with memory locations and various constants. Usually, every constant and variable is given a name so instructions can reference those locations by name, thus promoting <a href="self-documenting%20code">self-documenting code</a>. In executable code, the name of each subroutine is associated with its entry point, so any calls to a subroutine can use its name. Inside subroutines, <a href="GOTO">GOTO</a> destinations are given labels. Some assemblers support "local symbols" which are lexically distinct from normal symbols (e.g., the use of "10$" as a GOTO destination).

Some assemblers, such as NASM, provide flexible symbol management, letting programmers manage different <a href="namespace">namespace</a>s, automatically calculate offsets within <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s, and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computations performed by the assembler. Labels can also be used to initialize constants and variables with relocatable addresses.

Assembly languages, like most other computer languages, allow comments to be added to program <a href="source%20code">source code</a> that will be ignored during assembly. Judicious commenting is essential in assembly language programs, as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine. The "raw" (uncommented) assembly language generated by compilers or disassemblers is quite difficult to read when changes must be made.

Many assemblers support "predefined macros", and others support "programmer-defined" (and repeatedly re-definable) macros involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constants are embedded. This sequence of text lines may include opcodes or directives. Once a macro has been defined its name may be used in place of a mnemonic. When the assembler processes such a statement, it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro, then processes them as if they existed in the source code file (including, in some assemblers, expansion of any macros existing in the replacement text). Macros in this sense date to IBM <a href="autocoder">autocoder</a>s of the 1950s.

In assembly language, the term "macro" represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts, such as in the <a href="C%20programming%20language">C programming language</a>, where its #define directive typically is used to create short single line macros. Assembler macro instructions, like macros in <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a> and some other languages, can be lengthy "programs" by themselves, executed by interpretation by the assembler during assembly.

Since macros can have 'short' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code, they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter, requiring fewer lines of source code, as with higher level languages. They can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs, optionally introduce embedded debugging code via parameters and other similar features.

Macro assemblers often allow macros to take <a href="parameter%20%28computer%20science%29">parameter</a>s. Some assemblers include quite sophisticated macro languages, incorporating such high-level language elements as optional parameters, symbolic variables, conditionals, string manipulation, and arithmetic operations, all usable during the execution of a given macro, and allowing macros to save context or exchange information. Thus a macro might generate numerous assembly language instructions or data definitions, based on the macro arguments. This could be used to generate record-style data structures or "unrolled" loops, for example, or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters. For instance, a "sort" macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key, not needing the run-time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification. An organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher-level language, since such programmers are not working with a computer's lowest-level conceptual elements. Underlining this point, macros were used to implement an early <a href="virtual%20machine">virtual machine</a> in <a href="SNOBOL4">SNOBOL4</a> (1967), which was written in the SNOBOL Implementation Language (SIL), an assembly language for a virtual machine, which was then targeted to physical machines by transpiled to a native assembler via a <a href="macro%20assembler">macro assembler</a>. This allowed a high degree of portability for the time.

Macros were used to customize large scale software systems for specific customers in the mainframe era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems. This was done, for example, by systems programmers working with <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s Conversational Monitor System / Virtual Machine (<a href="VM/CMS">VM/CMS</a>) and with IBM's "real time transaction processing" add-ons, Customer Information Control System <a href="CICS">CICS</a>, and <a href="Airline%20Control%20Program">ACP</a>/<a href="Transaction%20Processing%20Facility">TPF</a>, the airline/financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large <a href="computer%20reservation%20system">computer reservation system</a>s (CRS) and credit card systems today.

It is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assembler to generate code written in completely different languages, for example, to generate a version of a program in <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a> using a pure macro assembler program containing lines of COBOL code inside assembly time operators instructing the assembler to generate arbitrary code. IBM <a href="OS/360">OS/360</a> uses macros to perform <a href="system%20generation">system generation</a>. The user specifies options by coding a series of assembler macros. Assembling these macros generates a <a href="job%20stream">job stream</a> to build the system, including <a href="job%20control%20language">job control language</a> and <a href="IBM%20mainframe%20utility%20programs">utility</a> control statements.

This is because, as was realized in the 1960s, the concept of "macro processing" is independent of the concept of "assembly", the former being in modern terms more word processing, text processing, than generating object code. The concept of macro processing appeared, and appears, in the C programming language, which supports "preprocessor instructions" to set variables, and make conditional tests on their values. Note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemblers, the C preprocessor is not <a href="Turing%20completeness">Turing-complete</a> because it lacks the ability to either loop or "go to", the latter allowing programs to loop.

Despite the power of macro processing, it fell into disuse in many high level languages (major exceptions being C/C++ and <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a>) while remaining a perennial for assemblers.

Macro parameter substitution is strictly by name: at macro processing time, the value of a parameter is textually substituted for its name. The most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name. In the macro:

the intention was that the caller would provide the name of a variable, and the "global" variable or constant b would be used to multiply "a". If foo is called with the parameter codice_8, the macro expansion of codice_9 occurs. To avoid any possible ambiguity, users of macro processors can parenthesize formal parameters inside macro definitions, or callers can parenthesize the input parameters.

Some assemblers have incorporated <a href="structured%20programming">structured programming</a> elements to encode execution flow. The earliest example of this approach was in the <a href="Concept-14%20macro%20set">Concept-14 macro set</a>, originally proposed by Dr. <a href="Harlan%20Mills">Harlan Mills</a> (March 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM's Federal Systems Division, which extended the S/360 macro assembler with IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks. This was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of <a href="GOTO">GOTO</a> operations in assembly code, one of the main factors causing <a href="spaghetti%20code">spaghetti code</a> in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early '80s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use).

A curious design was <a href="A-natural">A-natural</a>, a "stream-oriented" assembler for 8080/<a href="Z80">Z80</a> processors from <a href="Whitesmiths">Whitesmiths Ltd.</a> (developers of the <a href="Unix">Unix</a>-like <a href="Idris%20%28operating%20system%29">Idris</a> operating system, and what was reported to be the first commercial <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> <a href="compiler">compiler</a>). The language was classified as an assembler, because it worked with raw machine elements such as <a href="opcodes">opcodes</a>, <a href="processor%20register">registers</a>, and memory references; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order. Parentheses and other special symbols, along with block-oriented structured programming constructs, controlled the sequence of the generated instructions. A-natural was built as the object language of a C compiler, rather than for hand-coding, but its logical syntax won some fans.

There has been little apparent demand for more sophisticated assemblers since the decline of large-scale assembly language development. In spite of that, they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiarities in the target system's architecture prevent the effective use of higher-level languages.

Assemblers with a strong macro engine allow structured programming via macros, such as the switch macro provided with the Masm32 package (note this code is a complete program):

Assembly languages, and the use of the word "assembly", date to the introduction of the <a href="stored-program%20computer">stored-program computer</a>. The first assembly language was developed in 1947 by <a href="Kathleen%20Booth">Kathleen Booth</a> for the <a href="APEXC">ARC2</a> at <a href="Birkbeck%2C%20University%20of%20London">Birkbeck, University of London</a> following work with <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> and <a href="Herman%20Goldstine">Herman Goldstine</a> at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>. The <a href="Electronic%20Delay%20Storage%20Automatic%20Calculator">Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator</a> (EDSAC) had an assembler called "initial orders" featuring one-letter mnemonics in 1949. SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program) was an assembly language for the <a href="IBM%20650">IBM 650</a> computer written by Stan Poley in 1955.

Assembly languages eliminate much of the error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming <a href="first-generation%20language">first-generation</a> programming needed with the earliest computers, freeing programmers from tedium such as remembering numeric codes and calculating addresses. They were once widely used for all sorts of programming. However, by the 1980s (1990s on <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s), their use had largely been supplanted by higher-level languages, in the search for improved <a href="programming%20productivity">programming productivity</a>. Today assembly language is still used for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are <a href="device%20driver">device driver</a>s, low-level <a href="embedded%20system">embedded system</a>s, and <a href="real-time%20computing">real-time</a> systems.

Historically, numerous programs have been written entirely in assembly language. Operating systems were entirely written in assembly language until the introduction of the <a href="Burroughs%20MCP">Burroughs MCP</a> (1961), which was written in <a href="Executive%20Systems%20Problem%20Oriented%20Language">Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language</a> (ESPOL), an Algol dialect. Many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well, including a large amount of the <a href="IBM%20mainframe">IBM mainframe</a> software written by large corporations. <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a>, <a href="FORTRAN">FORTRAN</a> and some <a href="PL/I">PL/I</a> eventually displaced much of this work, although a number of large organizations retained assembly-language application infrastructures well into the 1990s.

Most early microcomputers relied on hand-coded assembly language, including most operating systems and large applications. This was because these systems had severe resource constraints, imposed idiosyncratic memory and display architectures, and provided limited, buggy system services. Perhaps more important was the lack of first-class high-level language compilers suitable for microcomputer use. A psychological factor may have also played a role: the first generation of microcomputer programmers retained a hobbyist, "wires and pliers" attitude.

In a more commercial context, the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal bloat (size), minimal overhead, greater speed, and reliability.

Typical examples of large assembly language programs from this time are IBM PC <a href="DOS">DOS</a> operating systems, the <a href="Turbo%20Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> compiler and early applications such as the <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> program <a href="Lotus%201-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a>. According to some industry insiders, the assembly language was the best computer language to use to get the best performance out of the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, a console that was notoriously challenging to develop and program games for. The 1993 arcade game "<a href="NBA%20Jam%20%281993%20video%20game%29">NBA Jam</a>" is another example.

Assembly language has long been the primary development language for many popular home computers of the 1980s and 1990s (such as the <a href="MSX">MSX</a>, <a href="Sinclair%20Research">Sinclair</a> <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="Commodore%20Amiga">Commodore Amiga</a>, and <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>). This was in large part because <a href="Interpreted%20language">interpreted</a> BASIC dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed, as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems. Some systems even have an <a href="integrated%20development%20environment">integrated development environment</a> (IDE) with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities. Some compilers available for the <a href="Radio%20Shack">Radio Shack</a> <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> and its successors had the capability to combine inline assembly source with high-level program statements. Upon compilation a built-in assembler produced inline machine code.

There have always been debates over the usefulness and performance of assembly language relative to high-level languages. Assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important; see below. , the <a href="TIOBE%20index">TIOBE index</a> of programming language popularity ranks assembly language at 14, ahead of <a href="Visual%20Basic">Visual Basic</a>, for example. Assembler can be used to optimize for speed or optimize for size. In the case of speed optimization, modern <a href="optimizing%20compiler">optimizing compiler</a>s are claimed to render high-level languages into code that can run as fast as hand-written assembly, despite the counter-examples that can be found. The complexity of modern processors and memory sub-systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compilers, as well as assembly programmers. Moreover, increasing processor performance has meant that most CPUs sit idle most of the time, with delays caused by predictable bottlenecks such as cache misses, <a href="I/O">I/O</a> operations and <a href="paging">paging</a>. This has made raw code execution speed a non-issue for many programmers.

There are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language:

Assembly language is still taught in most <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> and <a href="electronic%20engineering">electronic engineering</a> programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly language as a tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as <a href="binary%20arithmetic">binary arithmetic</a>, <a href="memory%20allocation">memory allocation</a>, <a href="stack%20%28data%20structure%29">stack processing</a>, <a href="character%20set">character set</a> encoding, <a href="interrupt">interrupt</a> processing, and <a href="compiler">compiler</a> design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages. This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although <a href="calculator">calculator</a>s are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.

<doc id="1369" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1369" title="Ambrosia">
Ambrosia

In the ancient <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myths</a>, ambrosia (, ) is sometimes the food or drink of the Greek gods, often depicted as conferring <a href="longevity">longevity</a> or <a href="immortality">immortality</a> upon whoever consumed it. It was brought to the gods in <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a> by <a href="doves">doves</a>.

"Ambrosia" is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a <a href="nymph">nymph</a> labeled with that name. In the <a href="%23Lycurgus%20of%20Thrace%20and%20Ambrosia">myth of Lycurgus</a>, an opponent to the wine god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, violence committed against Ambrosia turns her into a grapevine.

Ambrosia is very closely related to the gods' other form of sustenance, "<a href="Nectar%23Etymology">nectar</a>". The two terms may not have originally been distinguished; though in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s poems nectar is usually the drink and ambrosia the food of the gods; it was with ambrosia Hera "cleansed all defilement from her lovely flesh", and with ambrosia Athena prepared <a href="Penelope">Penelope</a> in her sleep, so that when she appeared for the final time before her suitors, the effects of years had been stripped away, and they were inflamed with passion at the sight of her. On the other hand, in <a href="Alcman">Alcman</a>, nectar is the food, and in <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a> and <a href="Anaxandrides">Anaxandrides</a>, ambrosia is the drink. A character in <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>' "<a href="The%20Knights">Knights</a>" says, "I dreamed the goddess poured ambrosia over your head—out of a ladle." Both descriptions could be correct, as Ambrosia could be a liquid that is considered a meal (much as <a href="soup">soup</a> is).

The consumption of ambrosia was typically reserved for divine beings. Upon his assumption into immortality on Olympus, <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> is given ambrosia by <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, while the hero <a href="Tydeus">Tydeus</a> is denied the same thing when the goddess discovers him eating human brains. In one version of the myth of <a href="Tantalus">Tantalus</a>, part of Tantalus' crime is that after tasting ambrosia himself, he attempts to steal some away to give to other mortals. Those who consume ambrosia typically had not blood in their veins, but <a href="ichor">ichor</a>.

Both nectar and ambrosia are fragrant, and may be used as <a href="perfume">perfume</a>: in the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" Menelaus and his men are disguised as seals in untanned seal skins, "and the deadly smell of the seal skins vexed us sore; but the goddess saved us; she brought ambrosia and put it under our nostrils." Homer speaks of ambrosial raiment, ambrosial locks of hair, even the gods' ambrosial sandals.

Among later writers, "ambrosia" has been so often used with generic meanings of "delightful liquid" that such late writers as <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a>, <a href="Saint%20Paul">Paul</a>us and <a href="Dioscurides">Dioscurides</a> employ it as a technical terms in contexts of cookery, medicine, and botany. <a href="Pliny%27s%20Natural%20History">Pliny</a> used the term in connection with different plants, as did early herbalists.

Additionally, some modern <a href="Ethnomycology">ethnomycologists</a>, such as <a href="Danny%20Staples">Danny Staples</a>, identify ambrosia with the <a href="Psychedelics%2C%20dissociatives%20and%20deliriants">hallucinogenic</a> mushroom "<a href="Amanita%20muscaria">Amanita muscaria</a>": "it was the food of the gods, their ambrosia, and nectar was the pressed sap of its juices", Staples asserts.

<a href="W.%20H.%20Roscher">W. H. Roscher</a> thinks that both nectar and ambrosia were kinds of <a href="honey">honey</a>, in which case their power of conferring immortality would be due to the supposed healing and cleansing powers of honey, which is in fact anti-septic, and because fermented honey (<a href="mead">mead</a>) preceded <a href="wine">wine</a> as an <a href="entheogen">entheogen</a> in the Aegean world; on some Minoan seals, goddesses were represented with <a href="bee">bee</a> faces (compare <a href="Merope%20%28Pleiades%29">Merope</a> and <a href="Melissa">Melissa</a>).

The concept of an immortality drink is attested in at least two <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Indo-European</a> areas: Greek and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. The Greek ἀμβροσία ("ambrosia") is semantically linked to the Sanskrit ("<a href="am%E1%B9%9Bta">amṛta</a>") as both words denote a drink or food that gods use to achieve immortality. The two words appear to be derived from the same Indo-European form *"ṇ-mṛ-tós", "un-dying" ("n-": negative prefix from which the prefix "a-" in both Greek and Sanskrit are derived; "mṛ": <a href="Ablaut">zero grade</a> of *"mer-", "to die"; and "-to-": adjectival suffix). A semantically similar etymology exists for <a href="Nectar%23Etymology">nectar</a>, the beverage of the gods (Greek: νέκταρ "néktar") presumed to be a compound of the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">PIE</a> roots "*nek-", "death", and "-*tar", "overcoming".


Lycurgus of Thrace, an antagonist of <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, forbade the cult of Dionysus, whom he drove from <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, and was driven mad by the god.

Ambrose

Aurelius Ambrosius ( ; ), better known in English as Saint Ambrose (; 4 April 397), was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milan">bishop of Milan</a> who became one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the <a href="4th%20century">4th century</a>. He was the <a href="Roman%20governor">Roman governor</a> of <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a> and <a href="Emilia%20%28region%20of%20Italy%29">Emilia</a>, headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374. Ambrose was a staunch opponent of <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>, and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, <a href="Jews">Jews</a>, and <a href="paganism">pagans</a>.

Traditionally, Ambrose is credited with promoting "antiphonal chant", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing "<a href="Veni%20redemptor%20gentium">Veni redemptor gentium</a>", an <a href="Advent">Advent</a> hymn.

Ambrose was one of the four original <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctors of the Church</a>, and is the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of Milan. He is notable for his influence on <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>.

Ambrose was born into a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Christian">Christian</a> family about 340 and was raised in <a href="Gallia%20Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a> (present-day <a href="Trier">Trier</a>, Germany). His father is sometimes identified with Aurelius Ambrosius, a <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Gaul">praetorian prefect of Gaul</a>; but some scholars identify his father as an official named Uranius who received an imperial constitution dated 3 February 339 (addressed in a brief extract from one of the three emperors ruling in 339, <a href="Constantine%20II%20%28emperor%29">Constantine II</a>, <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a>, or <a href="Constans">Constans</a>, in the "<a href="Codex%20Theodosianus">Codex Theodosianus</a>", book XI.5).

His mother was a woman of intellect and piety and she was a member of roman gens of "Aurelii Symmachi" and thus Ambrose was cousin of the orator Q. Aurelius Symmachus.

Ambrose's siblings, <a href="Satyrus%20of%20Milan">Satyrus</a> (who is the subject of Ambrose's "De excessu fratris Satyri") and <a href="Saint%20Marcellina">Marcellina</a>, are also venerated as saints. There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of <a href="bee">bee</a>s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of <a href="honey">honey</a>. His father considered this a <a href="Christian%20symbolism">sign</a> of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and <a href="beehive">beehive</a>s often appear in the <a href="saint%20symbolism">saint's symbology</a>.

After the early death of his father, Ambrose followed his father's career. He was educated in Rome, studying <a href="literature">literature</a>, <a href="law">law</a>, and <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>. <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Italy">Praetorian Prefect</a> <a href="Sextus%20Claudius%20Petronius%20Probus">Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus</a> first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him governor of Liguria and Emilia, with headquarters at Milan, which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.

Ambrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374, when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of <a href="Valentinian%20I">Valentinian I</a>. Ambrose never married.

In the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Milan">diocese of Milan</a> between the <a href="Nicene%20Christianity">Nicene Church</a> and <a href="Arianism">Arians</a>. In 374 <a href="Auxentius%20of%20Milan">the bishop of Milan, Auxentius</a>, an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the <a href="Apostolic%20succession">succession</a>. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call, "Ambrose, bishop!", which was taken up by the whole assembly.

Ambrose was known to be Nicene Christian in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in <a href="theology">theology</a>. Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor <a href="Gratianus">Gratian</a> praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>.

As bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister <a href="Saint%20Marcellina">Marcellina</a> (who later became a nun), and committed the care of his family to his brother.This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor. Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of "The Goodness of Death".

According to legend, Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a> in Milan. He studied theology with <a href="Simplician">Simplician</a>, a <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a> of Rome. Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like <a href="Philo">Philo</a>, <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, and <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil of Caesarea</a>, with whom he was also exchanging letters. He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.

In the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the <a href="Nicene%20creed">Nicene creed</a> and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor <a href="Gratian">Gratian</a> supported orthodoxy, the younger <a href="Valentinian%20II">Valentinian II</a>, who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed. Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.

In this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops <a href="Palladius%20of%20Ratiaria">Palladius of Ratiaria</a> and Secundianus of <a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a>, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a <a href="Council%20of%20Aquileia%2C%20381">synod</a> composed of thirty-two bishops was held at <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.

Nevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385 or 386 the emperor and his mother <a href="Justina%20%28empress%29">Justina</a>, along with a considerable number of <a href="clergy">clergy</a> and <a href="laity">laity</a>, especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, one in the city (the <a href="Basilica">Basilica</a> of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians. Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council. He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">divine service</a> in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of <a href="Easter">Easter</a>.

In spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop Ambrose declared:

The imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When <a href="Magnus%20Maximus">Magnus Maximus</a> usurped the supreme power in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.

A second later embassy was unsuccessful. The enemy entered <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Milan">Milan</a> was taken. Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.

In 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused <a href="Valentinian%20II">Valentinian II</a>'s imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops. In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop <a href="Auxentius%20of%20Durostorum">Auxentius the younger</a>, and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.

<a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a>, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was <a href="Excommunication%23Roman%20Catholic%20Church">excommunicated</a> by Ambrose for the <a href="Massacre%20of%20Thessaloniki">massacre</a> of 7,000 people at <a href="Thessalonika">Thessalonica</a> in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters. Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate <a href="David%20%28biblical%20king%29">David</a> in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt — Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. Ambrose also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians. These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor — the controversy of <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.

In 392, after the death of <a href="Valentinian%20II">Valentinian II</a> and the acclamation of <a href="Eugenius">Eugenius</a>, Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.

In his treatise on <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, Ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics. In 388, Emperor <a href="Theodosius%20the%20Great">Theodosius the Great</a> was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> at Callinicum on the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop. Ambrose wrote to him, pointing out that he was thereby "exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death"; in the letter "the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met, especially by the plea that the Jews had burnt many churches". In the course of the letter Ambrose speaks of the clemency that the emperor had shown with regard to the burning of other buildings and then adds: "There is, then, no adequate cause for such a commotion, that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building, and much less since it is the burning of a synagogue, a home of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of folly, which God Himself has condemned. For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah: 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim. And do not thou pray for that people, and do not thou ask mercy for them, and do not come near Me on their behalf, for I will not hear thee. Or seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah?' God forbids intercession to be made for those." In his exposition of <a href="Psalm%201">Psalm 1</a>, Ambrose says: "Virtues without faith are leaves, flourishing in appearance, but unproductive. How many pagans have mercy and sobriety but no fruit, because they do not attain their purpose! The leaves speedily fall at the wind's breath. Some Jews exhibit purity of life and much diligence and love of study, but bear no fruit and live like leaves."

Ambrose disliked Pagans, under Ambrose's major influence, emperors <a href="Gratian">Gratian</a>, <a href="Valentinian%20II">Valentinian II</a> and <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> carried on a persecution of <a href="Paganism">Paganism</a>. Under Ambrose's influence, Theodosius issued the 391 "<a href="Christian%20persecution%20of%20paganism%20under%20Theodosius%20I%23Theodosian%20decrees%20%28389%E2%80%93391%29">Theodosian decrees</a>," which with increasing intensity outlawed Pagan practises, and the <a href="Altar%20of%20Victory">Altar of Victory</a> was removed by Gratian. Ambrose prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and Theodosius to reject requests to restore the Altar.

In April 393 <a href="Arbogast%20%28general%29">Arbogast</a>, "magister militum" of the West and his puppet Emperor <a href="Eugenius">Eugenius</a> marched into Italy to consolidate their position in regard to <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> and his son, <a href="Honorius%20%28emperor%29">Honorius</a>, whom Theodosius had appointed Augustus to govern the western portion of the empire. Arbogast and Eugenius courted Ambrose's support by very obliging letters; but before they arrived at Milan, he had retired to Bologna, where he assisted at the translation of the relics of Saints Vitalis and Agricola. From there he went to Florence, where he remained until Eugenius withdrew from Milan to meet Theodosius in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Frigidus">Battle of the Frigidus</a> in early September 394.
Soon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the <a href="Roman%20empire">Roman empire</a>, Theodosius died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397) Ambrose also died. He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by <a href="Simplician">Simplician</a>. Ambrose's body may still be viewed in the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Sant%27Ambrogio">church of Saint Ambrogio</a> in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated — along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of <a href="Saints%20Gervase%20and%20Protase">Saints Gervase and Protase</a>.

Many circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.

He was generous to the <a href="poverty">poor</a>; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two <a href="martyr">martyr</a>s, <a href="Gervasius%20and%20Protasius">Gervasius and Protasius</a>. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.

Ambrose ranks with <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a>, <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, and <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>, as one of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctors of the Church</a>. Theologians compare him with <a href="Hilary%20of%20Poitiers">Hilary</a>, who they claim fell short of Ambrose's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater <a href="theology">theological</a> ability. He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of <a href="Biblical">Biblical</a> and <a href="doctrinal">doctrinal</a> subjects.

Ambrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing <a href="doctrine">doctrine</a> of the Church and its <a href="sacerdotal">sacerdotal</a> ministry, while the prevalent <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> of the day, continuing the <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a> and <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian <a href="ethics">ethics</a>. Thus we have the "De officiis ministrorum", "De viduis", "De virginitate" and "De paenitentia".

Ambrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place. His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom. "When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not. Follow the custom of the church where you are." Thus Ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the "right" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem. His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, "<a href="wikt%3Awhen%20in%20Rome%2C%20do%20as%20the%20Romans%20do">When in Rome, do as the Romans do.</a>"

One interpretation of Ambrose's writings is that he was a <a href="Christian%20universalism">Christian universalist</a>. It has been noted that Ambrose's theology was significantly influenced by that of <a href="Origen">Origen</a> and <a href="Didymus%20the%20Blind">Didymus the Blind</a>, two other early Christian universalists. One quotation cited in favor of this belief:
One could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell). Several other works by Ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation. For example:
Ambrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders, but a part of the united, solidary people. Giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but a repayment of resources that God had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped.

The theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence Popes <a href="Pope%20Damasus%20I">Damasus</a>, <a href="Siricius">Siricius</a> and <a href="Pope%20Leo%20the%20Great">Leo XIII</a>. Central to Ambrose is the <a href="virginity">virginity</a> of Mary and her role as <a href="Mother%20of%20God">Mother of God</a>.


Ambrose viewed <a href="celibacy">celibacy</a> as superior to marriage and saw <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Mariology">Mary</a> as the model of virginity.

In matters of <a href="exegesis">exegesis</a> he is, like Hilary, an <a href="Alexandrian%20school">Alexandrian</a>. In <a href="dogma">dogma</a> he follows <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil of Caesarea</a> and other Greek authors, but nevertheless gives a distinctly Western cast to the speculations of which he treats. This is particularly manifest in the weightier emphasis which he lays upon human <a href="sin">sin</a> and <a href="divine%20grace">divine grace</a>, and in the place which he assigns to <a href="faith">faith</a> in the individual Christian life.

Ambrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of <a href="Ambrosian%20chant">Ambrosian chant</a> also known simply as "antiphonal <a href="chant">chant</a>", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other. (The later pope Saint <a href="Gregory%20I%20the%20Great">Gregory I the Great</a> is not known to have composed any <a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>, the <a href="plainsong">plainsong</a> or "<a href="Romish%20chant">Romish chant</a>".) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing <a href="hymnody">hymnody</a> from the Eastern Church into the West.

Catching the impulse from <a href="Hilary%20of%20Arles">Hilary of Arles</a> and confirmed in it by the success of Arian <a href="psalmody">psalmody</a>, Ambrose composed several original <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Each of these hymns has eight four-line <a href="stanza">stanza</a>s and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs). Marked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.

In his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of <a href="psalms">psalms</a>, in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an "<a href="antiphon">antiphon</a>".

Saint Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn "<a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>", which he is said to have composed when he baptised <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Saint Augustine of Hippo</a>, his celebrated convert.

Ambrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine's</a> "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>". It is commonly understood in the Christian Tradition that Ambrose baptized Augustine.

In a passage of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine's</a> "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>" in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:
In this same passage of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine's</a> "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>" is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading:
This is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.

Latin

English translations

Several of Ambrose's works have recently been published in the bilingual Latin-German <a href="Fontes%20Christiani">Fontes Christiani</a> series (currently edited by <a href="Brepols">Brepols</a>).

Several religious brotherhoods which have sprung up in and around Milan at various times since the 14th century have been called Ambrosians. Their connection to Ambrose is tenuous

Ambracia

Ambracia (; , occasionally , "Ampracia"), was a city of ancient Greece on the site of modern <a href="Arta%2C%20Greece">Arta</a>. It was founded as a <a href="Corinth%2C%20Greece">Corinthian</a> <a href="colonies%20in%20antiquity">colony</a> in the 7th century BC and was situated about 7 miles from the <a href="Ambracian%20Gulf">Ambracian Gulf</a>, on a bend of the navigable river <a href="Arachthos%20River">Arachthos</a> (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain.
It was founded between 650 and 625 BC by <a href="Gorgus">Gorgus</a>, son of the Corinthian tyrant <a href="Cypselus">Cypselus</a>, at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus. After the expulsion of Gorgus's son Periander its government developed into a strong democracy. The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> trade), and its consequent aversion to <a href="Corcyra">Corcyra</a> (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sybota">Battle of Sybota</a>, which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a>).

Ambraciot politics featured many frontier disputes with the <a href="Amphilochians">Amphilochians</a> and <a href="Acarnanians">Acarnanians</a>. Hence it took a prominent part in the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> until the crushing defeat at <a href="Idomene">Idomene</a> (426), which crippled its resources.

In the 4th century BC it continued its traditional policy, but in 338 was besieged by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>. With the assistance of Corinth and Athens, it escaped complete domination at Philip's hands, but was nevertheless forced to accept a Macedonian garrison. In 294 BC, after forty-three years of semi-autonomy under <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ian suzerainty, Ambracia was given by the son of <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> to <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a>, king of <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a>, who made it his capital, and adorned it with palace, temples and theatres.

Amber

Amber is <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ized tree <a href="resin">resin</a>, which has been appreciated for its color and natural beauty since <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times. Much valued from antiquity to the present as a <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>, amber is made into a variety of decorative objects. Amber is used in <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>. It has also been used as a healing agent in folk medicine.

There are five classes of amber, defined on the basis of their chemical constituents. Because it originates as a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material as <a href="Inclusion%20%28mineral%29">inclusions</a>. Amber occurring in coal seams is also called resinite, and the term ambrite is applied to that found specifically within <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> coal seams.

The English word "amber" derives from <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> (cognate with <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a> "ambar") via <a href="Middle%20Latin">Middle Latin</a> "ambar" and <a href="Middle%20French">Middle French</a> "ambre". The word was adopted in <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> in the 14th century as referring to what is now known as "<a href="ambergris">ambergris</a>" ("ambre gris" or "grey amber"), a solid waxy substance derived from the <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>. 
In the <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a>, the sense of the word had come to be extended to Baltic amber (fossil resin) from as early as the late 13th century. At first called white or yellow amber ("ambre jaune"), this meaning was adopted in English by the early 15th century. As the use of ambergris waned, this became the main sense of the word.

The two substances ("yellow amber" and "grey amber") conceivably became associated or confused because they both were found washed up on beaches. Ambergris is less dense than water and floats, whereas amber is too dense to float, though less dense than stone. 
The classical names for amber, <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "electrum" and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> ("ēlektron"), are connected to a term ἠλέκτωρ ("ēlektōr") meaning "beaming <a href="Sun">Sun</a>". According to myth, when <a href="Phaethon">Phaëton</a> son of <a href="Helios">Helios</a> (the Sun) was killed, his mourning sisters became <a href="Populus">poplar</a> trees, and their tears became "elektron", amber.

Amber is discussed by <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> in the 4th century BC, and again by <a href="Pytheas">Pytheas</a> (c. 330 BC) whose work "On the Ocean" is lost, but was referenced by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, according to whose "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">The Natural History</a>" (in what is also the earliest known mention of the name "<a href="Germania">Germania</a>"):
Pytheas says that the <a href="Gutones">Gutones</a>, a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary of the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance of six thousand stadia; that, at one day's sail from this territory, is the Isle of <a href="Abalus">Abalus</a>, upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by the waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete form; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and sell it to their neighbors, the <a href="Teutones">Teutones</a>.
Earlier Pliny says that a large island of three days' sail from the <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>n coast called <a href="Baltia">Balcia</a> by <a href="Xenophon%20of%20Lampsacus">Xenophon of Lampsacus</a>, author of a fanciful travel book in Greek, is called Basilia by Pytheas. It is generally understood to be the same as Abalus. Based on the amber, the island could have been <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a>, <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a>, the shores of <a href="Bay%20of%20Gdansk">Bay of Gdansk</a>, the <a href="Sambia%20Peninsula">Sambia Peninsula</a> or the <a href="Curonian%20Lagoon">Curonian Lagoon</a>, which were historically the richest sources of amber in northern Europe.
It is assumed that there were well-established trade routes for amber connecting the Baltic with the Mediterranean (known as the "<a href="Amber%20Road">Amber Road</a>"). Pliny states explicitly that the Germans export amber to <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>, from where it was traded further abroad by the <a href="Adriatic%20Veneti">Veneti</a>.
The ancient Italic peoples of southern Italy were working amber, the most important examples are on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Siritide to <a href="Matera">Matera</a>.
Amber used in antiquity as at <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> and in the prehistory of the Mediterranean comes from deposits of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>.

Pliny also cites the opinion of <a href="Nicias">Nicias</a>, according to whom amber:is a liquid produced by the rays of the sun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun's setting, striking with the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an unctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and thrown up upon the shores of Germany. Besides the fanciful explanations according to which amber is "produced by the Sun", Pliny cites opinions that are well aware of its origin in tree resin, citing the native Latin name of "succinum" ("sūcinum", from "sucus" "juice"). He writes: Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees belonging to the pine genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin from the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in considerable quantities, and is gradually hardened [...] Our forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree, and for this reason gave it the name of "succinum" and one great proof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact that it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when ignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.He also states that amber is also found in Egypt and in India, and he even refers to the <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a> properties of amber, by saying that "in Syria the women make the <a href="spindle%20whorl">whorl</a>s of their spindles of this substance, and give it the name of "harpax" [from ἁρπάζω, "to drag"] from the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and the light fringe of tissues."

Pliny says that the German name of amber was "<a href="%3Awikt%3AAppendix%3AProto-Germanic/glas%C4%85%23Proto-Germanic">glæsum</a>", "for which reason the Romans, when Germanicus Cæsar commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these islands the name of Glæsaria, which by the barbarians was known as Austeravia". This is confirmed by the recorded <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "glas" and <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "<a href="%3Awikt%3Agl%C3%A6r%23Old%20English">glær</a>" for "amber" (c.f. "<a href="wikt%3Aglass">glass</a>").
In <a href="Middle%20Low%20German">Middle Low German</a>, amber was known as "berne-, barn-, börnstēn". The Low German term became dominant also in <a href="High%20German">High German</a> by the 18th century, thus modern German "Bernstein" besides Dutch <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> "barnsteen".

The <a href="Baltic%20languages">Baltic</a> <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> term for amber is "gintaras" and <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a> "dzintars". They, and the <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> "jantar" or Hungarian "gyanta" ('resin'), are thought to originate from <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a> "jainitar" ("sea-resin").

Early in the nineteenth century, the first reports of amber from North America came from discoveries in New Jersey along Crosswicks Creek near Trenton, at Camden, and near Woodbury.

Amber is <a href="heterogeneous">heterogeneous</a> in composition, but consists of several <a href="resin">resin</a>ous bodies more or less soluble in <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a>, <a href="diethyl%20ether">ether</a> and <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>, associated with an insoluble <a href="Bitumen">bituminous</a> substance. Amber is a <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a> by free <a href="radical%20polymerization">radical polymerization</a> of several precursors in the <a href="labdane">labdane</a> family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene. These labdanes are <a href="diterpene">diterpene</a>s (CH) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three <a href="alkene">alkene</a> groups for <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a>. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as <a href="isomerization">isomerization</a> reactions, <a href="Cross-link">crosslinking</a> and <a href="cyclization">cyclization</a>.

Heated above , amber decomposes, yielding an oil of amber, and leaves a black residue which is known as "amber colophony", or "amber pitch"; when dissolved in oil of <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> or in <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a> this forms "amber varnish" or "amber lac".

Molecular polymerization, resulting from high pressures and temperatures produced by overlying sediment, transforms the resin first into <a href="copal">copal</a>. Sustained heat and pressure drives off <a href="terpene">terpene</a>s and results in the formation of amber.

For this to happen, the resin must be resistant to decay. Many trees produce resin, but in the majority of cases this deposit is broken down by physical and biological processes. Exposure to sunlight, rain, microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi), and extreme temperatures tends to disintegrate resin. For resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must be resistant to such forces or be produced under conditions that exclude them.

Fossil resins from Europe fall into two categories, the famous Baltic ambers and another that resembles the "<a href="Agathis">Agathis</a>" group. Fossil resins from the Americas and Africa are closely related to the modern genus "<a href="Hymenaea">Hymenaea</a>", while Baltic ambers are thought to be fossil resins from <a href="Sciadopitys">Sciadopityaceae</a> family plants that used to live in north Europe.

The abnormal development of resin in living trees ("succinosis") can result in the formation of amber. Impurities are quite often present, especially when the resin dropped onto the ground, so the material may be useless except for varnish-making. Such impure amber is called "firniss".

Such <a href="Inclusion%20%28mineral%29">inclusion</a> of other substances can cause amber to have an unexpected color. <a href="Pyrites">Pyrites</a> may give a bluish color. "Bony amber" owes its cloudy opacity to numerous tiny bubbles inside the resin. However, so-called "black amber" is really only a kind of <a href="Jet%20%28lignite%29">jet</a>.

In darkly clouded and even opaque amber, inclusions can be imaged using high-energy, high-contrast, high-resolution <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s.

Amber is globally distributed, mainly in rocks of Cretaceous age or younger.
Historically, the <a href="Sambia%20Peninsula">Samland</a> coast west of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> in <a href="Prussia%20%28region%29">Prussia</a> was the world's leading source of amber. The first mentions of amber deposits here date back to the 12th century. About 90% of the world's extractable amber is still located in that area, which became the <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a> of Russia in 1946.

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. Elsewhere, amber is mined, both in open works and underground galleries. Then nodules of "blue earth" have to be removed and an opaque crust must be cleaned off, which can be done in revolving barrels containing sand and water. Erosion removes this crust from sea-worn amber.
<a href="Caribbean%20amber">Caribbean amber</a>, especially <a href="Dominican%20amber">Dominican</a> <a href="blue%20amber">blue amber</a>, is mined through <a href="bell%20pit">bell pit</a>ting, which is dangerous due to the risk of tunnel collapse.

The Vienna amber factories, which use pale amber to manufacture pipes and other smoking tools, turn it on a <a href="Lathe%20%28tool%29">lathe</a> and polish it with whitening and water or with <a href="rotten%20stone">rotten stone</a> and oil. The final luster is given by friction with flannel.

When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a>, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be clarified in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of "ambroid" or "pressed amber".

The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then compressed into a uniform mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. The product is extensively used for the production of cheap jewelry and articles for smoking. This pressed amber yields brilliant interference colors in polarized light. Amber has often been imitated by other resins like <a href="copal">copal</a> and <a href="kauri%20gum">kauri gum</a>, as well as by <a href="celluloid">celluloid</a> and even <a href="glass">glass</a>. Baltic amber is sometimes colored artificially, but also called "true amber".

Amber occurs in a range of different colors. As well as the usual yellow-orange-brown that is associated with the color "amber", amber itself can range from a whitish color through a pale lemon yellow, to brown and almost black. Other uncommon colors include red amber (sometimes known as "cherry amber"), green amber, and even <a href="blue%20amber">blue amber</a>, which is rare and highly sought after.

Yellow amber is a hard, translucent, yellow, orange, or brown fossil resin from evergreen trees. Known to the Iranians by the Pahlavi compound word kah-ruba (from kah "straw" plus rubay "attract, snatch", referring to its electrical properties), which entered Arabic as kahraba' or kahraba (which later became the Arabic word for <a href="electricity">electricity</a>, كهرباء "kahrabā<nowiki>'</nowiki>"), it too was called amber in Europe (Old French and Middle English ambre). Found along the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, yellow amber reached the Middle East and western Europe via trade. Its coastal acquisition may have been one reason yellow amber came to be designated by the same term as ambergris. Moreover, like ambergris, the resin could be burned as an incense. The resin's most popular use was, however, for ornamentation—easily cut and polished, it could be transformed into beautiful jewelry.
Much of the most highly prized amber is transparent, in contrast to the very common cloudy amber and opaque amber. Opaque amber contains numerous minute bubbles. This kind of amber is known as "bony amber".

Although all <a href="Dominican%20amber">Dominican amber</a> is fluorescent, the rarest Dominican amber is blue amber. It turns blue in natural sunlight and any other partially or wholly <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light source. In long-wave UV light it has a very strong reflection, almost white. Only about is found per year, which makes it valuable and expensive.

Sometimes amber retains the form of drops and <a href="stalactite">stalactite</a>s, just as it exuded from the ducts and receptacles of the injured trees. It is thought that, in addition to exuding onto the surface of the tree, amber resin also originally flowed into hollow cavities or cracks within trees, thereby leading to the development of large lumps of amber of irregular form.

Amber can be classified into several forms. Most fundamentally, there are two types of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. <a href="Terpenoid">Terpenoid</a>s, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of <a href="isoprene">isoprene</a> (CH) units. <a href="Phenolic%20resin">Phenolic resin</a>s are today only produced by <a href="angiosperms">angiosperms</a>, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct <a href="Medullosales">medullosan</a>s produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins. The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes. There is also a separate classification of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.

This class is by far the most abundant. It comprises labdatriene carboxylic acids such as communic or ozic acids. It is further split into three sub-classes. Classes Ia and Ib utilize regular labdanoid diterpenes (e.g. communic acid, communol, biformenes), while Ic uses "enantio" labdanoids (ozic acid, ozol, "enantio" biformenes).

Includes "Succinite" (= 'normal' Baltic amber) and "Glessite". Have a communic acid base. They also include much succinic acid.

<a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic amber</a> yields on dry distillation succinic acid, the proportion varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest in the pale opaque or "bony" varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name "succinite". Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather greater than that of many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via <a href="IR%20spectroscopy">IR spectroscopy</a> due to a specific <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.

Like class Ia ambers, these are based on communic acid; however, they lack <a href="succinic%20acid">succinic acid</a>.

This class is mainly based on "enantio"-labdatrienonic acids, such as ozic and zanzibaric acids. Its most familiar representative is Dominican amber.

Dominican amber differentiates itself from <a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic amber</a> by being mostly transparent and often containing a higher number of <a href="fossil">fossil</a> inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest. Resin from the extinct species "<a href="Hymenaea%20protera">Hymenaea protera</a>" is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. It is not "<a href="succinite">succinite</a>" but "<a href="retinite">retinite</a>".

These ambers are formed from resins with a sesquiterpenoid base, such as <a href="cadinene">cadinene</a>.

These ambers are <a href="polystyrenes">polystyrenes</a>.

Class IV is something of a wastebasket; its ambers are not polymerized, but mainly consist of cedrene-based sesquiterpenoids.

Class V resins are considered to be produced by a pine or pine relative. They comprise a mixture of diterpinoid resins and "n"-alkyl compounds. Their type mineral is "highgate copalite".

The oldest amber recovered dates to the <a href="Carboniferous">Upper Carboniferous</a> period (). Its chemical composition makes it difficult to match the amber to its producers – it is most similar to the resins produced by <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s; however, there are no flowering plant fossils until the Cretaceous, and they were not common until the <a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a>. Amber becomes abundant long after the Carboniferous, in the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a>, , when it is found in association with <a href="Prehistoric%20insects">insects</a>. The oldest amber with arthropod inclusions comes from the Levant, from Lebanon and Jordan. This amber, roughly 125–135 million years old, is considered of high scientific value, providing evidence of some of the oldest sampled <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s.

In Lebanon, more than 450 outcrops of Lower Cretaceous amber were discovered by Dany Azar, a Lebanese paleontologist and entomologist. Among these outcrops, 20 have yielded biological inclusions comprising the oldest representatives of several recent families of terrestrial arthropods. Even older, <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> amber has been found recently in Lebanon as well. Many remarkable insects and spiders were recently discovered in the amber of Jordan including the oldest <a href="zoraptera">zoraptera</a>ns, <a href="Cleridae">clerid beetles</a>, umenocoleid <a href="cockroach">roaches</a>, and achiliid <a href="planthopper">planthopper</a>s.

Baltic amber or succinite (historically documented as Prussian amber) is found as irregular <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodule</a>s in marine <a href="Glauconite">glauconitic</a> sand, known as "blue earth", occurring in the Lower <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> strata of <a href="Sambia%20Peninsula">Sambia</a> in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> (in historical sources also referred to as "Glaesaria"). After 1945, this territory around <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> was turned into <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, where amber is now systematically mined.

It appears, however, to have been partly derived from older <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> deposits and it occurs also as a derivative phase in later formations, such as <a href="glacial%20drift">glacial drift</a>. Relics of an abundant flora occur as inclusions trapped within the amber while the resin was yet fresh, suggesting relations with the flora of Eastern <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and the southern part of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. <a href="Heinrich%20G%C3%B6ppert">Heinrich Göppert</a> named the common amber-yielding pine of the Baltic forests "Pinites succiniter", but as the wood does not seem to differ from that of the existing genus it has been also called "Pinus succinifera". It is improbable, however, that the production of amber was limited to a single species; and indeed a large number of conifers belonging to different genera are represented in the amber-flora.

Amber is a unique <a href="Fossilization">preservational mode</a>, preserving otherwise unfossilizable parts of organisms; as such it is helpful in the reconstruction of ecosystems as well as organisms; the chemical composition of the resin, however, is of limited utility in reconstructing the phylogenetic affinity of the resin producer.

Amber sometimes contains animals or plant matter that became caught in the resin as it was secreted. Insects, spiders and even their webs, annelids, frogs, crustaceans, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="amoebae">amoebae</a>, marine microfossils, wood, flowers and fruit, hair, feathers and other small organisms have been recovered in Cretaceous ambers (deposited c. ). The oldest amber to bear fossils (mites) is from the Carnian (Triassic, ) of north-eastern Italy.

Amber has been used since prehistory (<a href="Solutrean">Solutrean</a>) in the manufacture of jewelry and ornaments, and also in <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a>.

Amber has been used since the stone age, from 13,000 years ago. Amber ornaments have been found in <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>an tombs and elsewhere across Europe. To this day it is used in the manufacture of smoking and glassblowing mouthpieces. Amber's place in culture and tradition lends it a tourism value; <a href="Palanga%20Amber%20Museum">Palanga Amber Museum</a> is dedicated to the fossilized resin.
Amber has long been used in <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a> for its purported healing properties. Amber and extracts were used from the time of <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> in ancient <a href="Greece">Greece</a> for a wide variety of treatments through the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and up until the early twentieth century.

In <a href="ancient%20China">ancient China</a>, it was customary to burn amber during large festivities. If amber is heated under the right conditions, <a href="oil%20of%20amber">oil of amber</a> is produced, and in past times this was combined carefully with <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> to create "artificial musk" – a resin with a peculiar <a href="musk">musk</a>y odor. Although when burned, amber does give off a characteristic "pinewood" fragrance, modern products, such as <a href="perfume">perfume</a>, do not normally use actual amber due to the fact that fossilized amber produces very little scent. In perfumery, scents referred to as “amber” are often created and patented
to emulate the opulent golden warmth of the fossil.

The modern name for amber is thought to come from the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> word, ambar, meaning <a href="ambergris">ambergris</a>. Ambergris is the waxy aromatic substance created in the intestines of <a href="sperm%20whale">sperm whale</a>s and was used in making perfumes both in ancient times as well as modern.

The scent of amber was originally derived from emulating the scent of ambergris and/or <a href="labdanum">labdanum</a> but due to the <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> status of the sperm whale the scent of amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. <a href="Benzoin">Benzoin</a> is usually part of the recipe. <a href="Vanilla">Vanilla</a> and <a href="clove">clove</a>s are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.

"Amber" perfumes may be created using combinations of labdanum, <a href="benzoin%20resin">benzoin resin</a>, <a href="copal">copal</a> (itself a type of tree resin used in incense manufacture), vanilla, <a href="Dammara%20resin">Dammara resin</a> and/or synthetic materials.

Amalaric

Amalaric (<a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a>: Amalareiks), or in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, "Amalarico", (502–531) was king of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> from 511 until his death in battle in 531. He was a son of king <a href="Alaric%20II">Alaric II</a> and his first wife Theodegotha, daughter of <a href="Theoderic%20the%20Great">Theoderic the Great</a> King of the Ostrogoths.

When <a href="Alaric%20II">Alaric II</a> was killed fighting <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis I</a>, king of the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vouill%C3%A9">Battle of Vouillé</a> (507), his kingdom fell into disarray. "More serious than the destruction of the Gothic army," writes Herwig Wolfram, "than the loss of both Aquitanian provinces and the capital of <a href="Toulouse">Toulose</a>, was the death of the king." Alaric had made no provision for a successor, and although he had two sons, one was of age but illegitimate and the other, Amalaric, the offspring of a legal marriage but still a child. Amalaric was carried for safety into <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, which country and <a href="Provence">Provence</a> were thenceforth ruled by his maternal grandfather, <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a>, acting through his vice-gerent, an <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogothic</a> nobleman named Theudis. The older son, <a href="Gesalec">Gesalec</a>, was chosen king but his reign was disastrous. King Theoderic of the Ostrogoths sent an army, led by his sword-bearer <a href="Theudis">Theudis</a>, against Gesalec, ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric; Gesalec fled to Africa. The Ostrogoths then drove back the Franks and their <a href="Burgundians">Burgundian</a> allies, regaining possession of "the south of <a href="Novempopulana">Novempopulana</a>, <a href="Rodez">Rodez</a>, probably even <a href="Albi">Albi</a>, and even Toulose". Following the 511 death of Clovis, Theoderic negotiated a peace with Clovis' successors, securing Visigothic control of the southernmost portion of Gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom.

In 522 the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theoderic's death, he assumed full royal power, although relinquishing Provence to his cousin <a href="Athalaric">Athalaric</a>. His kingdom was faced with a threat from the north from the Franks; according to Peter Heather, this was his motivation for marrying <a href="Clotilde%20%28died%20531%29">Chrotilda</a>, the daughter of Clovis. However, this was not successful, for according to <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>, Amalaric pressured her to forsake her <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> faith and convert to <a href="Arianism">Arian Christianity</a>, at one point beating her until she bled; she sent to her brother <a href="Childebert%20I">Childebert I</a>, king of <a href="Paris">Paris</a> a towel stained with her own blood. It is worth noting Ian Wood's advice that although Gregory provides the fullest information for this period, where it touches Merovingian affairs, he often "allowed his religious bias to determine his interpretation of the events." Peter Heather agrees with Wood's implication in this instance: "I doubt that this is the full story, but the effects of Frankish intervention are clear enough."

Childebert defeated the Visigothic army and took <a href="Narbonne">Narbonne</a>. Amalaric fled south to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, where according to <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, he was assassinated by his own men. According to Peter Heather, Theoderic's former governor Theudis was implicated in Amalaric's murder, "and was certainly its prime beneficiary." As for Chrotilda, in Gregory's words she died on the journey home "by some ill chance". Childebert had her body brought to Paris where she was buried alongside her father Clovis.

Alphorn

The alphorn or alpenhorn or alpine horn is a <a href="Brass%20instrument">labrophone</a>, consisting of a wooden <a href="natural%20horn">natural horn</a> of <a href="bore%20%28wind%20instruments%29">conical bore</a>, having a wooden cup-shaped <a href="mouthpiece%20%28brass%29">mouthpiece</a>, used by mountain dwellers in the <a href="Swiss%20Alps">Swiss Alps</a>, <a href="Austria">Austrian Alps</a>, <a href="Bavarian%20Alps">Bavarian Alps</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="French%20Alps">French Alps</a>, and elsewhere. Similar wooden horns were used for <a href="communication">communication</a> in most mountainous regions of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, from the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> to the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathians</a>.

For a long time, scholars believed that the alphorn had been derived from the Roman-Etruscan <a href="lituus">lituus</a>, because of their resemblance in shape, and because of the word "liti", meaning Alphorn in the dialect of <a href="Obwalden">Obwalden</a>. There is no documented evidence for this theory, however, and, the word "liti" was probably borrowed from 16th–18th century writings in Latin, where the word "lituus" could describe various wind instruments, such as the <a href="natural%20horn">horn</a>, the <a href="crumhorn">crumhorn</a>, or the <a href="cornett">cornett</a>. Swiss naturalist <a href="Conrad%20Gesner">Conrad Gesner</a> used the words "lituum alpinum" for the first known detailed description of the alphorn in his "De raris et admirandis herbis" in 1555. The oldest known document using the German word "Alphorn" is a page from a 1527 account book from the former <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> abbey St. Urban near <a href="Pfaffnau">Pfaffnau</a> mentioning the payment of two <a href="Batzen">Batzen</a> for an itinerant alphorn player from the <a href="Valais">Valais</a>.

17th–19th century collections of alpine myths and legends suggest that alphorn-like instruments had frequently been used as signal instruments in village communities since medieval times or earlier, sometimes substituting for the lack of <a href="church%20bells">church bells</a>. Surviving artifacts, dating back to as far as ca. AD 1400, include wooden <a href="Brass%20instrument">labrophones</a> in their stretched form, like the alphorn, or coiled versions, such as the "Büchel" and the "Allgäuisches Waldhorn" or "Ackerhorn". The alphorn's exact origins remain indeterminate, and the ubiquity of horn-like signal instruments in valleys throughout Europe may indicate a long history of cross influences regarding their construction and usage.

The alphorn is carved from solid <a href="softwood">softwood</a>, generally spruce but sometimes pine. In former times the alphorn maker would find a tree bent at the base in the shape of an alphorn, but modern makers piece the wood together at the base. A cup-shaped mouthpiece carved out of a block of hard wood is added and the instrument is complete.

An alphorn made at Rigi-Kulm, Schwyz, and now in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, measures in length and has a straight tube. The Swiss alphorn varies in shape according to the locality, being curved near the bell in the Bernese Oberland. <a href="Michael%20Praetorius">Michael Praetorius</a> mentions an alphorn-like instrument under the name of Hölzern Trummet (wooden trumpet) in "Syntagma Musicum" (Wittenberg, 1615–1619; Pl. VIII).

The alphorn has no lateral openings and therefore gives the pure <a href="Harmonic%20series%20%28music%29">natural harmonic series</a> of the open pipe. The notes of the natural harmonic series overlap, but do not exactly correspond, to notes found in the familiar chromatic scale in standard Western <a href="equal%20temperament">equal temperament</a>. Most prominently within the alphorn's range, the 7th and 11th harmonics are particularly noticeable, because they fall between adjacent notes in the chromatic scale.
Accomplished alphornists often command a range of nearly three octaves, consisting of the 2nd through the 16th notes of the harmonic series. The availability of the higher tones is due in part to the relatively small diameter of the bore of the mouthpiece and tubing in relation to the overall length of the horn.
The well-known "<a href="Ranz%20des%20Vaches">Ranz des Vaches</a>" (<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/19980214205945/http%3A//www.lyoba.ch/culture/desalpe/ranz.htm%23PARTITION">score</a>; <a href="http%3A//www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html%3Fsid%3D7020216%26amp%3BcKey%3D1183635931000%26amp%3Bty%3Dst%26amp%3BrubricId%3D25004%26amp%3BsiteSect%3D25001">audio</a>) is a traditional Swiss melody often heard on the alphorn. The song describes the time of bringing the cows to the high country at cheese making time. <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a> introduced the "Ranz des Vaches" into his masterpiece "William Tell," along with many other delightful melodies scattered throughout the opera in vocal and instrumental parts that are well-suited to the alphorn. <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> wrote to <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a> that the inspiration for the dramatic entry of the horn in the introduction to the last movement of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">First Symphony</a> was an alphorn melody he heard while vacationing in the Rigi area of Switzerland.

Among music composed for the alphorn:


The alphorn is prominently featured in television advertisements for <a href="Ricola">Ricola</a> cough drops, which are manufactured in Switzerland.

Army

An army (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "arma" "arms, weapons" via <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "armée", "armed" (feminine)) or ground force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land. In the broadest sense, it is the land-based <a href="military%20branch">military branch</a>, service branch or armed service of a <a href="nation">nation</a> or <a href="State%20%28polity%29">state</a>. It may also include other branches of the military such as the <a href="air%20force">air force</a> via means of aviation corps. Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a <a href="field%20army">field army</a>. They differ from <a href="army%20reserves">army reserves</a> who are activated only during such times as <a href="war">war</a> or <a href="natural%20disaster">natural disaster</a>s.

In several countries, the army is officially called the Land Army to differentiate it from an <a href="air%20force">air force</a> called the Air Army, notably <a href="French%20Air%20Force">France</a>. In such countries, the word "army" on its own retains its connotation of a land force in common usage. The current largest army in the world, by number of active troops, is the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army%20Ground%20Force">People's Liberation Army Ground Force</a> of <a href="China">China</a> with 1,600,000 active troops and 510,000 <a href="Military%20reserve%20force">reserve personnel</a> followed by the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a> with 1,129,000 active troops and 960,000 reserve personnel.

By convention, <a href="irregular%20military">irregular military</a> is understood in contrast to <a href="regular%20army">regular armies</a> which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite <a href="militia">militia</a>. Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc. Regular military can also refer to full-time status (<a href="standing%20army">standing army</a>), versus <a href="Military%20reserve%20force">reserve</a> or part-time personnel. Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the <a href="National%20Defence%20Act">National Defence Act</a>), from de facto "non-statutory" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies. Armies may also be <a href="expeditionary%20warfare">expeditionary</a> (designed for overseas or international deployment) or <a href="fencible">fencible</a> (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).

During the Iron Age in <a href="India">India</a>, the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya</a> and <a href="Nanda%20Empire">Nanda</a> Empires had large armies. According to <a href="Megasthenes">Megasthenes</a>, the Greek ambassador to the court of <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a> (), the Mauryas wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants not including followers and attendants.

<a href="China">China</a> has existed as a continuous culture for thousands of years; the states of China raised armies for at least 1000 years before the <a href="Spring%20and%20Autumn%20Annals">Spring and Autumn Annals</a>, which date back to the time of Sparta. By the <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a>, the crossbow had been perfected enough to become a military secret, with bronze bolts which could pierce any armor. Thus any political power of a state rested on the armies and their organization. China underwent political consolidation of the states of <a href="Han%20%28state%29">Han (韓)</a>, <a href="Wei%20%28state%29">Wei (魏)</a>, <a href="Chu%20%28state%29">Chu (楚)</a>, <a href="Yan%20%28state%29">Yan (燕)</a>, <a href="Zhao%20%28state%29">Zhao (趙)</a> and <a href="Qi%20%28Shandong%29">Qi (齊)</a>, until by 221 BCE, <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a> (秦始皇帝), the first emperor of the <a href="Qin%20dynasty">Qin dynasty</a>, attained absolute power. This first emperor of China could command the creation of a <a href="Terracotta%20Army">Terracotta Army</a> to guard his tomb in the city of <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a> (西安), as well as a realignment of the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall of China</a> to strengthen his empire against insurrection, invasion and incursion.

<a href="Sun%20Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>'s "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20War">The Art of War</a>" remains one of China's <a href="Seven%20Military%20Classics">Seven Military Classics</a>, even though it is two thousand years old. Since no political figure could exist without an army, measures were taken to ensure only the most capable leaders could control the armies. <a href="Scholar-bureaucrat">Civil bureaucracies (士大夫)</a> arose to control the productive power of the states, and their military power.

The <a href="Spartan%20Army">Spartan Army</a> was one of the earliest known professional armies. Boys were sent to a <a href="barracks">barracks</a> at the age of seven to train for becoming a soldier. At the age of thirty they were released from the barracks and allowed to marry and have a family. After that, men devoted their lives to war until their retirement at the age of 60. Unlike other civilizations, whose armies had to disband during the planting and harvest seasons, the Spartan <a href="serf">serf</a>s or "<a href="helot">helot</a>s," did the manual labor.

This allowed the Spartans to field a full-time army with a campaign season that lasted all year. The Spartan Army was largely composed of <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s, equipped with arms and armor nearly identical to each other. Each hoplite bore the Spartan emblem and a scarlet uniform. The main pieces of this armor were a round shield, a spear and a helmet.

The <a href="Roman%20Army">Roman Army</a> had its origins in the citizen army of the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Republic</a>, which was staffed by citizens serving mandatory duty for Rome. <a href="Marian%20Reforms">Reforms</a> turned the army into a professional organization which was still largely filled by citizens, but these citizens <a href="career%20soldier">served continuously</a> for 25 years before being discharged.

The Romans were also noted for making use of <a href="Auxiliary%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliary troops</a>, non-Romans who served with the <a href="Roman%20legion">legion</a>s and filled roles that the traditional Roman military could not fill effectively, such as <a href="skirmisher">light skirmish troops</a> and <a href="heavy%20cavalry">heavy cavalry</a>. After their service in the army they were made citizens of Rome and then their children were citizens also. They were also given land and money to settle in Rome. In the <a href="Late%20Roman%20Empire">Late Roman Empire</a>, these auxiliary troops, along with foreign mercenaries, became the core of the Roman Army; moreover, by the time of the Late Roman Empire tribes such as the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> were paid to serve as <a href="Mercenary">mercenaries</a>.

In the earliest <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> it was the obligation of every <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocrat</a> to respond to the call to battle with his own equipment, archers, and infantry. This decentralized system was necessary due to the social order of the time, but could lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment and abilities. The more resources the noble had access to, the better his troops would be.

The <a href="knight">knight</a>s were drawn to battle by feudal and social obligation, and also by the prospect of profit and advancement. Those who performed well were likely to increase their landholdings and advance in the social hierarchy. The prospect of significant income from pillage, and ransoming prisoners was also important. For the mounted knight war could be a relatively low risk affair.

As central governments grew in power, a return to the citizen armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the <a href="peasantry">peasantry</a> began to be the central recruiting tool. <a href="England">England</a> was one of the most centralized states in the Middle Ages, and the armies that fought in the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> were, predominantly, composed of paid professionals.

In theory, every Englishman had an obligation to serve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, especially one on the continent.

Thus the <a href="scutage">scutage</a> was introduced, whereby most Englishmen paid to escape their service and this money was used to create a permanent army. However, almost all high medieval armies in Europe were composed of a great deal of paid core troops, and there was a large <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> market in Europe from at least the early 12th century.

As the Middle Ages progressed in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiers who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially in combination with standing forces, but in Italy they came to dominate the armies of the city states. This made them considerably less reliable than a standing army. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare in Italy also led to relatively bloodless campaigns which relied as much on maneuver as on battles.

In 1439 the <a href="France">French</a> legislature, known as the <a href="Estates%20General%20%28France%29">Estates General</a> (<a href="French%20language">French</a>: "états généraux"), passed laws that restricted military recruitment and training to the king alone. There was a new tax to be raised known as the "<a href="taille">taille</a>" that was to provide funding for a new Royal army. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as "<a href="Compagnie%20d%27ordonnance">compagnies d'ordonnance</a>" on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. The reforms of the 1440s, eventually led to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Castillon">French victory at Castillon</a> in 1453, and the conclusion of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. By 1450 the companies were divided into the field army, known as the "grande ordonnance" and the garrison force known as the "petite ordonnance" .

First <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a>s lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire <a href="Mercenary">mercenaries</a> to serve in their armies during wartime. Such mercenaries typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments.

The <a href="veteran">veteran</a> soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia.

As late as the 1650s, most troops were mercenaries. However, after the 17th century, most states invested in better disciplined and more politically reliable permanent troops. For a time mercenaries became important as trainers and administrators, but soon these tasks were also taken by the state. The massive size of these armies required a large supporting force of administrators.

The newly centralized states were forced to set up vast organized bureaucracies to manage these armies, which some historians argue is the basis of the modern bureaucratic state. The combination of increased taxes and increased centralisation of government functions caused a series of revolts across Europe such as the <a href="Fronde">Fronde</a> in France and the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>.

In many countries, the resolution of this conflict was the rise of <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a>. Only in England and the Netherlands did representative government evolve as an alternative. From the late 17th century, states learned how to finance wars through long term low interest loans from national banking institutions. The first state to master this process was the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. This transformation in the armies of Europe had great social impact. The defense of the state now rested on the commoners, not on the aristocrats.

However, aristocrats continued to monopolise the officer corps of almost all early modern armies, including their high command. Moreover, popular revolts almost always failed unless they had the support and patronage of the noble or gentry classes. The new armies, because of their vast expense, were also dependent on taxation and the commercial classes who also began to demand a greater role in society. The great commercial powers of the Dutch and English matched much larger states in military might.

As any man could be quickly trained in the use of a musket, it became far easier to form massive armies. The inaccuracy of the weapons necessitated large groups of massed soldiers. This led to a rapid swelling of the size of armies. For the first time huge masses of the population could enter combat, rather than just the highly skilled professionals.

It has been argued that the drawing of men from across the nation into an organized corps helped breed national unity and patriotism, and during this period the modern notion of the <a href="nation%20state">nation state</a> was born. However, this would only become apparent after the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. At this time, the "<a href="lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse">levée en masse</a>" and <a href="conscription">conscription</a> would become the defining paradigm of <a href="modern%20warfare">modern warfare</a>.

Before then, however, most national armies were in fact composed of many nationalities. In Spain armies were recruited from all the Spanish European territories including Spain, Italy, <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a> (<a href="Walloon%20Guards">Walloon Guards</a>) and Germany. The French recruited some soldiers from Germany, Switzerland as well as from <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>. Britain recruited <a href="Hesse">Hessian</a> and <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Hanovrian</a> troops until the late 18th century. Irish Catholics made careers for themselves in the armies of many Catholic European states.

Prior to the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> in England, the <a href="monarch">monarch</a> maintained a personal Bodyguard of <a href="Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">Yeomen of the Guard</a> and the <a href="Honourable%20Corps%20of%20Gentlemen%20at%20Arms">Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms</a>, or "gentlemen pensioners", and a few locally raised companies to garrison important places such as <a href="Berwick%20on%20Tweed">Berwick on Tweed</a> or <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> (or <a href="Calais">Calais</a> before it was <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281558%29">recaptured</a> by <a href="France">France</a> in 1558).

Troops for foreign expeditions were raised upon an "ad hoc" basis. <a href="Noblemen">Noblemen</a> and professional regular <a href="soldier">soldier</a>s were commissioned by the monarch to supply troops, raising their quotas by <a href="indenture">indenture</a> from a variety of sources. On January 26, 1661 <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> issued the Royal Warrant that created the genesis of what would become the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, although the Scottish and English Armies would remain two separate organizations until the unification of England and Scotland in 1707. The small force was represented by only a few regiments.

After the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> was quickly disbanded as part of the Americans' distrust of standing armies, and irregular state militias became the sole ground army of the United States, with the exception of one battery of artillery guarding <a href="West%20Point">West Point</a>'s arsenal. Then <a href="First%20American%20Regiment">First American Regiment</a> was established in 1784. However, because of continuing conflict with <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army. The first of these, the <a href="Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Legion of the United States</a>, was established in 1791.

Until 1733 the common soldiers of <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian Army</a> consisted largely of <a href="peasantry">peasantry</a> recruited or impressed from <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>-<a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, leading many to flee to neighboring countries. To halt this trend, <a href="Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William I</a> divided Prussia into <a href="Cantonist%20%28Prussia%29">regimental cantons</a>. Every youth was required to serve as a soldier in these recruitment districts for three months each year; this met agrarian needs and added extra troops to bolster the regular ranks.

<a href="Russian%20tsar">Russian tsar</a>s before <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter I of Russia</a> maintained professional hereditary musketeer corps (<a href="streltsy">streltsy</a> in Russian) that were highly unreliable and undisciplined. In times of war the armed forces were augmented by peasants. Peter I introduced a <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">modern regular army</a> built on German model, but with a new aspect: officers not necessarily from <a href="nobility">nobility</a>, as talented commoners were given promotions that eventually included a noble title at the attainment of an officer's rank. Conscription of peasants and townspeople was based on quota system, per settlement. Initially it was based on the number of households, later it was based on the population numbers. The term of service in the 18th century was for life. In 1793 it was reduced to 25 years. In 1834 it was reduced to 20 years plus 5 years in reserve and in 1855 to 12 years plus 3 years of reserve.

The first <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> were <a href="Janissaries">Janissaries</a>. They replaced forces that mostly comprised tribal warriors ("<a href="Ghazw">ghazi</a>s") whose loyalty and morale could not always be trusted. The first Janissary units were formed from prisoners of war and slaves, probably as a result of the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's booty in kind rather than cash.

From the 1380s onwards, their ranks were filled under the "<a href="dev%C5%9Firme">devşirme</a>" system, where feudal dues were paid by service to the sultan. The "recruits" were mostly Christian youths, reminiscent of <a href="mamluk">mamluk</a>s.

<a href="China">China</a> organized the <a href="Manchu%20people">Manchu people</a> into the <a href="Eight%20Banner%20system">Eight Banner system</a> in the early 17th century. Defected <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming</a> armies formed the <a href="Green%20Standard%20Army">Green Standard Army</a>. These troops enlisted voluntarily and for long terms of service.

<a href="Conscription">Conscription</a> allowed the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a> to form the "<a href="La%20Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">La Grande Armée</a>", what <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> called "the nation in arms", which successfully battled European professional armies.

Conscription, particularly when the conscripts are being sent to foreign wars that do not directly affect the security of the nation, has historically been highly politically contentious in democracies.

<a href="Canada">Canada</a> also had a political dispute over conscription during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Similarly, mass protests against conscription to fight the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> occurred in several countries in the late 1960s.

In developed nations, the increasing emphasis on technological firepower and better-trained fighting forces, the sheer unlikelihood of a conventional military assault on most developed nations, as well as memories of the contentiousness of the Vietnam War experience, make mass conscription unlikely in the foreseeable future.

<a href="Russia">Russia</a>, as well as many other nations, retains mainly a conscript army. There is also a very rare "citizen army" as used in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> (see <a href="Military%20of%20Switzerland">Military of Switzerland</a>).

Western armies are usually subdivided as follows:

A <a href="field%20army">field army</a> is composed of a headquarters, army <a href="troops">troops</a>, a variable number of <a href="corps">corps</a>, typically between three and four, and a variable number of <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>, also between three and four. A battle is influenced at the Field Army level by transferring divisions and reinforcements from one corps to another to increase the pressure on the enemy at a critical point. Field armies are controlled by a General or Lieutenant General.

A particular army can be named or numbered to distinguish it from military land forces in general. For example, the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">First United States Army</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. In the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> it is normal to spell out the ordinal number of an army (e.g. First Army), whereas lower formations use figures (e.g. 1st Division).

Armies (as well as <a href="army%20group">army group</a>s and <a href="Theater%20%28military%29">theater</a>s) are large formations which vary significantly between armed forces in size, composition, and scope of responsibility.

In the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Force">Soviet Air Force</a>, "Armies" could vary in size, but were subordinate to an <a href="Army%20Group">Army Group</a>-sized "<a href="Front%20%28Soviet%20Army%29">front</a>" in wartime. In peacetime, a <a href="Army%20%28Soviet%20Army%29">Soviet army</a> was usually subordinate to a <a href="military%20district">military district</a>. <a href="Viktor%20Suvorov">Viktor Suvorov</a>'s "Inside the Soviet Army" describes how <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era Soviet military districts were actually composed of a front headquarters and a military district headquarters co-located for administration and <a href="Military%20deception">deception</a> ('maskirovika') reasons.

Alligatoridae

The <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Alligatoridae of <a href="crocodylia">crocodylia</a>ns includes <a href="alligator">alligator</a>s and <a href="caiman">caiman</a>s.

The lineage including alligators proper (<a href="Alligatorinae">Alligatorinae</a>) occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the <a href="Cretaceous">Upper Chalk</a> in Europe, where they did not die out until the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> age. The true alligators are today represented by two species, "<a href="American%20Alligator">A. mississippiensis</a>" in the <a href="southeastern%20United%20States">southeastern United States</a>, which can grow to 15 ft (4.6 m) and weigh 1000 lbs (453 kg) and the small "<a href="Chinese%20Alligator">A. sinensis</a>" in the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, which grows to an average of 5 ft (1.5 m). Their name derives from the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> "el lagarto", which means "the lizard".

In <a href="Central%20America">Central</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily <a href="Caimaninae">Caimaninae</a>, which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony <a href="scute">scute</a>s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in "<a href="Caiman%20%28genus%29">Caiman</a>", the smooth-fronted caimans in genus "<a href="Paleosuchus">Paleosuchus</a>" and the black caiman in "<a href="Melanosuchus">Melanosuchus</a>" are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.

"C. crocodilus", the <a href="Caiman%20crocodilus">spectacled caiman</a>, has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about . The largest is the <a href="red%20list">near-threatened</a> "Melanosuchus niger", the "jacare-assu" or large or <a href="black%20caiman">black caiman</a> of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> basin. Black caimans grow to , with the largest recorded size . The black caiman and <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a> are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a> family.

Although caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.

<a href="Alligator">Alligator</a>s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and an intolerance to salinity, alligators strongly preferring fresh water, while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. In general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. Another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and American alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.

Alder

Alder is the common name of a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s (Alnus) belonging to the birch <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Betulaceae">Betulaceae</a>. The genus comprises about 35 <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Plant%20sexual%20morphology">monoecious</a> <a href="tree">tree</a>s and <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, a few reaching a large size, distributed throughout the <a href="Temperate%20climate">north temperate zone</a> with a few species extending into <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>, as well as the northern and southern <a href="Andes">Andes</a>.

The common name "alder" evolved from Old English "alor", which in turn is derived from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> root "aliso". The generic name "Alnus" is the equivalent <a href="Latin">Latin</a> name. Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> root "el-", meaning "red" or "brown", which is also a root for the English words "<a href="Elk%20%28disambiguation%29">elk</a>" and another tree: "<a href="elm">elm</a>", a tree distantly related to the alders.

With a few exceptions, alders are <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a>, and the leaves are alternate, simple, and <a href="serration">serrated</a>. The <a href="flower">flower</a>s are <a href="catkin">catkin</a>s with elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-pollinated, but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees differ from the <a href="birch">birch</a>es ("Betula", the other genus in the family) in that the female catkins are woody and do not disintegrate at maturity, opening to release the seeds in a similar manner to many <a href="conifer%20cone">conifer cone</a>s.

The largest species are <a href="red%20alder">red alder</a> ("A. rubra") on the west coast of North America, and <a href="Alnus%20glutinosa">black alder</a> ("A. glutinosa"), <a href="native%20plant">native</a> to most of Europe and widely introduced elsewhere, both reaching over 30 m. By contrast, the widespread "<a href="Alnus%20viridis">Alnus viridis</a>" (green alder) is rarely more than a 5-m-tall shrub.

Alders are commonly found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the <a href="Alnus%20rhombifolia">white alder</a> (Alnus rhombifolia) unlike other northwest alders, has an affinity for warm, dry climates, where it grows along watercourses, such as along the lower <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> east of the Cascades and the Snake River, including Hells Canyon.

Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by numerous <a href="List%20of%20Lepidoptera%20that%20feed%20on%20alders">butterflies and moths</a>.

"A. glutinosa" and "A. viridis" are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand. Alder leaves and especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they enrich the soil with nitrogen and other nutrients.

Alder is particularly noted for its important <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship with "<a href="Frankia%20alni">Frankia alni</a>", an <a href="actinomycete">actinomycete</a>, <a href="Filamentation">filamentous</a>, nitrogen-fixing <a href="bacteria">bacterium</a>. This bacterium is found in <a href="root%20nodule">root nodule</a>s, which may be as large as a human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> from the air and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s, which it produces through <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the <a href="Fertility%20%28soil%29">fertility of the soil</a> where it grows, and as a <a href="pioneer%20species">pioneer species</a>, it helps provide additional nitrogen for the <a href="Ecological%20succession">successional</a> species which follow.
Because of its abundance, red alder delivers large amounts of nitrogen to enrich forest soils. Red alder stands have been found to supply between 120 and 290 pounds of nitrogen per acre (130 to 320 kg per ha) annually to the soil. From Alaska to Oregon, Sitka alder characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the foot of retreating glaciers. Studies show that Sitka alder, a more shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average of 55 pounds per acre (60 per ha) per year, helping convert the sterile glacial terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest. Alders are common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc. Alder groves themselves often serve as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers. Their foliage and leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light surface fires. In addition, the light weight of alder seeds (650,000 per pound, or 1.5 million per kg) allows for easy dispersal by the wind. Although it outgrows coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is very shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years. Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest. Groves of red alder 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm) in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of 100 to 110 feet (30 to 33 m) in about sixty years and then lose vigor as heart rot sets in. Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them.

Alder roots are parasitized by <a href="Boschniakia%20rossica">northern groundcone</a>.

The <a href="catkin">catkin</a>s of some alder species have a degree of edibility, and may be rich in protein. Reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste, they are more useful for survival purposes. The wood of certain alder species is often used to smoke various food items such as coffee, salmon and other seafood.

Most of the pilings that form the foundation of Venice were made from alder trees.

Alder bark contains the anti-inflammatory <a href="salicin">salicin</a>, which is metabolized into <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a> in the body. Some Native American cultures use red alder bark ("<a href="Alnus%20rubra">Alnus rubra</a>") to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations. Blackfeet Indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis. Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains <a href="betulin">betulin</a> and <a href="lupeol">lupeol</a>, compounds shown to be effective against a variety of tumors.

The inner bark of the alder, as well as <a href="red%20osier%20dogwood">red osier dogwood</a>, or <a href="chokecherry">chokecherry</a>, is used by some <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous peoples of the Americas</a> in smoking mixtures, known as "kinnikinnick", to improve the taste of the <a href="bearberry">bearberry</a> leaf.

Alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the Austrian town of <a href="Grossarl">Grossarl</a>.

Electric guitars, most notably those manufactured by the <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender Musical Instruments Corporation</a>, have been built with alder bodies since the 1950s. Alder is appreciated for its claimed tight and even balanced tone, especially when compared to mahogany, and has been adopted by many electric guitar manufacturers.

As a <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>, alder is used in making furniture, cabinets, and other woodworking products. For example, in the television series "<a href="Northern%20Exposure">Northern Exposure</a>" season 3 episode "Things Become Extinct" (1992), Native American Ira Wingfeather makes duck <a href="flute">flute</a>s out of alder tree branches while <a href="Ed%20Chigliak">Ed Chigliak</a> films.

Alder bark and wood (like <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="sweet%20chestnut">sweet chestnut</a>) contain <a href="tannin">tannin</a> and are traditionally used to tan leather.

A red dye can also be extracted from the outer bark, and a yellow dye from the inner bark.

The genus is divided into three subgenera:

Subgenus "Alnus": Trees with stalked shoot buds, male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) but stay closed over winter, pollinating in late winter or early spring, about 15–25 species, including:




Subgenus "Clethropsis". Trees or shrubs with stalked shoot buds, male and female catkins produced in autumn (fall) and expanding and pollinating then, three species:

Subgenus "Alnobetula". Shrubs with shoot buds not stalked, male and female catkins produced in late spring (after leaves appear) and expanding and pollinating then, one to four species:

<doc id="1384" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1384" title="Amos Bronson Alcott">
Amos Bronson Alcott

Amos Bronson Alcott (; November 29, 1799March 4, 1888) was an American teacher, writer, <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>, and reformer. As an educator, Alcott pioneered new ways of interacting with young students, focusing on a conversational style, and avoided traditional punishment. He hoped to perfect the human spirit and, to that end, advocated a <a href="veganism">vegan</a> diet before the term was coined. He was also an <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> and an advocate for <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>.

Born in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> in 1799, Alcott had only minimal formal schooling before attempting a career as a traveling salesman. Worried about how the itinerant life might have a negative impact on his soul, he turned to teaching. His innovative methods, however, were controversial, and he rarely stayed in one place very long. His most well-known teaching position was at the <a href="Temple%20School%2C%20Boston%20%281830s%29">Temple School</a> in Boston. His experience there was turned into two books: "Records of a School" and "Conversations with Children on the Gospels". Alcott became friends with <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and became a major figure in <a href="transcendentalism">transcendentalism</a>. His writings on behalf of that movement, however, are heavily criticized for being incoherent. Based on his ideas for human perfection, Alcott founded <a href="Fruitlands%20%28transcendental%20center%29">Fruitlands</a>, a transcendentalist experiment in community living. The project was short-lived and failed after seven months. Alcott continued to struggle financially for most of his life. Nevertheless, he continued focusing on educational projects and opened a new school at the end of his life in 1879. He died in 1888.

Alcott married <a href="Abby%20May">Abby May</a> in 1830 and they eventually had four surviving children, all daughters. Their second was <a href="Louisa%20May%20Alcott">Louisa May</a>, who fictionalized her experience with the family in her novel "<a href="Little%20Women">Little Women</a>" in 1868.

A native <a href="New%20England">New England</a>er, Amos Bronson Alcott was born in <a href="Wolcott%2C%20Connecticut">Wolcott, Connecticut</a> (only recently renamed from "Farmingbury") on November 29, 1799. His parents were Joseph Chatfield Alcott and Anna Bronson Alcott. The family home was in an area known as Spindle Hill, and his father, Joseph Alcox, traced his ancestry to colonial-era settlers in eastern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. The family originally spelled their name "Alcock", later changed to "Alcocke" then "Alcox". Amos Bronson, the oldest of eight children, later changed the spelling to "Alcott" and dropped his first name.
At age six, young Bronson began his formal education in a one-room schoolhouse in the center of town but learned how to read at home with the help of his mother. The school taught only reading, writing, and spelling and he left this school at the age of 10. At age 13, his uncle, Reverend Tillotson Bronson, invited Alcott into his home in <a href="Cheshire%2C%20Connecticut">Cheshire, Connecticut</a> to be educated and prepared for college. Bronson gave it up after only a month and was self-educated from then on. He was not particularly social and his only close friend was his neighbor and second cousin <a href="William%20Alcott">William Alcott</a>, with whom he shared books and ideas. Bronson Alcott later reflected on his childhood at Spindle Hill: "It kept me pure... I dwelt amidst the hills... God spoke to me while I walked the fields." Starting at age 15, he took a job working for clockmaker <a href="Seth%20Thomas%20%28clockmaker%29">Seth Thomas</a> in the nearby town of <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Connecticut">Plymouth</a>.

At age 17, Alcott passed the exam for a teaching certificate but had trouble finding work as a teacher. Instead, he left home and became a traveling salesman in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">American South</a>, peddling books and merchandise. He hoped the job would earn him enough money to support his parents, "to make their cares, and burdens less... and get them free from debt", though he soon spent most of his earnings on a new suit. At first, he thought it an acceptable occupation but soon worried about his spiritual well-being. In March 1823, Alcott wrote to his brother: "Peddling is a hard place to serve God, but a capital one to serve <a href="Mammon">Mammon</a>." Near the end of his life, he fictionalized this experience in his book, "New Connecticut", originally circulated only among friends before its publication in 1881.

By the summer of 1823, Alcott returned to Connecticut in debt to his father, who bailed him out after his last two unsuccessful sales trips. He took a job as a schoolteacher in Cheshire with the help of his Uncle Tillotson. He quickly set about reforming the school. He added backs to the benches on which students sat, improved lighting and heating, de-emphasized <a href="rote%20learning">rote learning</a>, and provided individual <a href="slate%20%28writing%29">slates</a> to each student—paid for by himself. Alcott had been influenced by <a href="educational%20philosophy">educational philosophy</a> of the <a href="Swiss%20%28people%29">Swiss</a> <a href="pedagogue">pedagogue</a> <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Pestalozzi">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> and even renamed his school "The Cheshire Pestalozzi School". His style attracted the attention of <a href="Samuel%20Joseph%20May">Samuel Joseph May</a>, who introduced Alcott to his sister <a href="Abby%20May">Abby May</a>. She called him, "an intelligent, philosophic, modest man" and found his views on education "very attractive". Locals in Cheshire were less supportive and became suspicious of his methods. Many students left and were enrolled in the local common school or a recently re-opened private school for boys. On November 6, 1827, Alcott started teaching in <a href="Bristol%2C%20Connecticut">Bristol, Connecticut</a>, still using the same methods he used in Cheshire, but opposition from the community surfaced quickly; he was unemployed by March 1828. He moved to Boston on April 24, 1828, and was immediately impressed, referring to the city as a place "where the light of the sun of righteousness has risen". He opened the Salem Street Infant School two months later on June 23. Abby May applied as his teaching assistant; instead, the couple were engaged, without consent of the family. They were married at <a href="King%27s%20Chapel">King's Chapel</a> on May 22, 1830; he was 30 years old and she was 29. Her brother conducted the ceremony and a modest reception followed at her father's house. After their marriage the Alcotts moved to 12 Franklin Street in Boston, a <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> run by a Mrs. Newall. Around this time, Alcott also first expressed his public disdain for <a href="slavery">slavery</a>. In November 1830, he and <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a> founded what he later called a "preliminary Anti-Slavery Society", though he differed from Garrison as a <a href="nonresistance">nonresistant</a>. Alcott became a member of the <a href="Boston%20Vigilance%20Committee">Boston Vigilance Committee</a>.

Attendance at Alcott's school was falling. A wealthy <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> named Reuben Haines proposed he and educator William Russell start a new school in Pennsylvania associated with the <a href="Germantown%20Academy">Germantown Academy</a>. Alcott accepted and he and his newly pregnant wife set forth on December 14. The school was established in <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Germantown</a> and the Alcotts were offered a rent-free home by Haines. Alcott and Russell were initially concerned that the area would not be conducive to their progressive approach to education and considered establishing the school in nearby <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> instead. Unsuccessful, they went back to Germantown, though the rent-free home was no longer available and the Alcotts instead had to rent rooms in a boarding-house. It was there that their first child, a daughter they named <a href="Anna%20Alcott%20Pratt">Anna Bronson Alcott</a>, was born on March 16, 1831, after 36 hours of labor. By the fall of that year, their benefactor Haines died suddenly and the Alcotts again suffered financial difficulty. "We hardly earn the bread", wrote Abby May to her brother, "[and] the butter we have to think about."

The couple's only son was born on April 6, 1839, but lived only a few minutes. The mother recorded: "Gave birth to a fine boy full grown perfectly formed but not living". It was in Germantown that the couple's second daughter was born. <a href="Louisa%20May%20Alcott">Louisa May Alcott</a> was born on her father's birthday, November 29, 1832, at a half-hour past midnight. Bronson described her as "a very fine healthful child, much more so than Anna was at birth". The Germantown school, however, was faltering; soon only eight pupils remained. Their benefactor Haines died before Louisa's birth. He had helped recruit students and even paid tuition for some of them. As Abby wrote, his death "has prostrated all our hopes here". On April 10, 1833, the family moved to Philadelphia, where Alcott ran a day school. As usual, Alcott's methods were controversial; a former student later referred to him as "the most eccentric man who ever took on himself to train and form the youthful mind." Alcott began to believe Boston was the best place for his ideas to flourish. He contacted theologian <a href="William%20Ellery%20Channing">William Ellery Channing</a> for support. Channing approved of Alcott's methods and promised to help find students to enroll, including his daughter Mary. Channing also secured aid from Justice <a href="Lemuel%20Shaw">Lemuel Shaw</a> and Boston mayor <a href="Josiah%20Quincy%2C%20Jr.">Josiah Quincy, Jr.</a>

On September 22, 1834, Alcott opened a school of about 30 students, mostly from wealthy families. It was named the <a href="Temple%20School%2C%20Boston%20%281830s%29">Temple School</a> because classes were held at the <a href="Masonic%20Temple">Masonic Temple</a> on Tremont Street in Boston. His assistant was <a href="Elizabeth%20Palmer%20Peabody">Elizabeth Palmer Peabody</a>, later replaced by <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a>. <a href="Mary%20Peabody%20Mann">Mary Peabody Mann</a> served as a French instructor for a time. The school was briefly famous, and then infamous, because of his original methods. Before 1830, writing (except in higher education) equated to rote drills in the rules of grammar, spelling, vocabulary, penmanship and transcription of adult texts. However, in that decade, progressive reformers such as Alcott, influenced by Pestalozzi as well as <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Friedrich Fröbel</a> and <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Herbart">Johann Friedrich Herbart</a>, began to advocate writing about subjects from students' personal experiences. Reformers debated against beginning instruction with rules and were in favor of helping students learn to write by expressing the personal meaning of events within their own lives. Alcott's plan was to develop self-instruction on the basis of self-analysis, with an emphasis on conversation and questioning rather than lecturing and drill, which were prevalent in the U.S. classrooms of the time. Alongside writing and reading, he gave lessons in "spiritual culture", which included interpretation of the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s, and advocated "object teaching" in writing instruction. He even went so far as to decorate his schoolroom with visual elements he thought would inspire learning: paintings, books, comfortable furniture, and busts or portraits of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, and William Ellery Channing.

During this time, the Alcotts had another child. Born on June 24, 1835, she was named <a href="Elizabeth%20Sewall%20Alcott">Elizabeth Peabody Alcott</a> in honor of the teaching assistant at the Temple School. By age three, however, her mother changed her name to Elizabeth "Sewall" Alcott, after her own mother.
In July 1835, Peabody published her account as an assistant to the Temple School as "Record of a School: Exemplifying the General Principles of Spiritual Culture". While working on a second book, Alcott and Peabody had a falling out and "Conversations with Children on the Gospels" was prepared with help from Peabody's sister <a href="Sophia%20Peabody">Sophia</a>, published at the end of December 1836. Alcott's methods were not well received; many found his conversations on the Gospels close to blasphemous. For example, he asked students to question if Biblical miracles were literal and suggested that all people are part of God. In the "<a href="Boston%20Daily%20Advertiser">Boston Daily Advertiser</a>", <a href="Nathan%20Hale%20%28journalist%29">Nathan Hale</a> criticized Alcott's "flippant and off hand conversation" about serious topics from the <a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">Virgin birth of Jesus</a> to <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a>. <a href="Joseph%20T.%20Buckingham">Joseph T. Buckingham</a> called Alcott "either insane or half-witted" and "an ignorant and presuming <a href="charlatan">charlatan</a>". The book did not sell well; a Boston lawyer bought 750 copies to use as waste paper.

The temple school was widely denounced in the press. Reverend <a href="James%20Freeman%20Clarke">James Freeman Clarke</a> was one of Alcott's few supporters and defended him against the harsh response from Boston periodicals. Alcott was rejected by most public opinion and, by the summer of 1837, he had only 11 students left and no assistant after Margaret Fuller moved to <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>. The controversy had caused many parents to remove their children and, as the school closed, Alcott became increasingly financially desperate. Remaining steadfast to his pedagogy, a forerunner of <a href="progressive%20education">progressive</a> and <a href="democratic%20school">democratic school</a>ing, he alienated parents in a later "parlor school" by admitting an <a href="African%20American">African American</a> child to the class, whom he then refused to expel in the face of protests.

Beginning in 1836, Alcott's membership in the <a href="Transcendental%20Club">Transcendental Club</a> put him in such company as <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="Orestes%20Brownson">Orestes Brownson</a> and <a href="Theodore%20Parker">Theodore Parker</a>. He became a member with the Club's second meeting and hosted their third. A biographer of Emerson described the group as "the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality". <a href="Frederic%20Henry%20Hedge">Frederic Henry Hedge</a> wrote of the group's nature: "There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women". Alcott preferred the term "Symposium" for their group.

In late April 1840, Alcott moved to the town of <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord</a> urged by Emerson. He rented a home for $50 a year within walking distance of <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson%20House">Emerson's house</a>; he named it Dove Cottage, though they also called it Concordia Cottage. A supporter of Alcott's philosophies, Emerson offered to help with his writing, which proved a difficult task. After several revisions, for example, he deemed the essay "Psyche" (Alcott's account of how he educated his daughters) unpublishable. Alcott also wrote a series patterned after the work of German writer <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> which were eventually published in the Transcendentalists' journal, "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>". Emerson wrote to Margaret Fuller, then editor, that they might "pass muster & even pass for just & great". He was wrong. Alcott's so-called "<a href="Orphism%20%28religion%29">Orphic</a> Sayings" were widely mocked for being silly and unintelligible; Fuller herself disliked them, but did not want to hurt Alcott's feelings. In the first issue, for example, he wrote:
On July 26, 1840, Abby May gave birth again. Originally referred to as Baby for several months, she was eventually named <a href="May%20Alcott">Abby May</a> after her mother. As a teenager, she changed the spelling of her name to "Abbie" before choosing to use only "May".

With financial support from Emerson, Alcott left Concord on May 8, 1842, to a visit to England, leaving his brother Junius with his family. He met two admirers, <a href="Charles%20Lane%20%28transcendentalist%29">Charles Lane</a> and Henry C. Wright. The two men were leaders of <a href="Alcott%20House">Alcott House</a>, an experimental school based on Alcott's methods from the Temple School located about ten miles outside <a href="London">London</a>. The school's founder, James Pierpont Greaves, had only recently died but Alcott was invited to stay there for a week. Alcott persuaded them to come to the United States with him; Lane and his son moved into the Alcott house and helped with family chores. Persuaded in part by Lane's <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist views</a>, Alcott took a stand against the <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> administration's plan to annex <a href="Texas">Texas</a> as a slave territory and <a href="tax%20resistance">refused to pay</a> his <a href="Tax%20per%20head">poll tax</a>. Abby May wrote in her journal on January 17, 1843, "A day of some excitement, as Mr. Alcott refused to pay his town tax... After waiting some time to be committed [to jail], he was told it was paid by a friend. Thus we were spared the affliction of his absence and the triumph of suffering for his principles." The annual poll tax was only $1.50. The incident inspired <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, whose similar protest led to a night in jail and his essay "<a href="Civil%20Disobedience%20%28Thoreau%29">Civil Disobedience</a>". Around this time, the Alcott family set up a sort of domestic post office to curb potential domestic tension. Abby May described her idea: "I thought it would afford a daily opportunity for the children, indeed all of us, to interchange thought and sentiment".

Lane and Alcott collaborated on a major expansion of their educational theories into a <a href="Utopia">Utopia</a>n society. Alcott, however, was still in debt and could not purchase the land needed for their planned community. In a letter, Lane wrote, "I do not see anyone to act the money part but myself." In May 1843, he purchased a farm in <a href="Harvard%2C%20Massachusetts">Harvard, Massachusetts</a>. Up front, he paid $1,500 of the total $1,800 value of the property; the rest was meant to be paid by the Alcotts over a two-year period. They moved to the farm on June 1 and optimistically named it "Fruitlands" despite only ten old apple trees on the property. In July, Alcott announced their plans in "The Dial": "We have made an arrangement with the proprieter of an estate of about a hundred acres, which liberates this tract from human ownership".

Their goal was to regain access to <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Eden</a> by finding the correct formula for perfect living, following specific rules governing agriculture, diet, and reproduction. In order to achieve this, they removed themselves from the economy as much as possible and lived independently; unlike a similar project named <a href="Brook%20Farm">Brook Farm</a>, the participants at Fruitlands avoided interaction with local communities. Calling themselves a "consociate family", they agreed to follow a strict vegetarian diet and to till the land without the use of animal labor. After some difficulty, they relented and allowed some cattle to be "enslaved". They also banned coffee, tea, alcoholic drinks, milk, and warm bathwater. They only ate "aspiring vegetables"—those which grew upward—and refused those that grew downward like potatoes. As Alcott had published earlier, "Our wine is water,—flesh, bread;—drugs, fruits." For clothing, they prohibited leather because animals were killed for it, as well as cotton, silk, and wool, because they were products of slave labor. Alcott had high expectations but was often away when the community most needed him as he attempted to recruit more members.

The experimental community was never successful, partly because most of the land was not <a href="arable%20land">arable</a>. Alcott lamented, "None of us were prepared to actualize practically the ideal life of which we dreamed. So we fell apart". Its founders were often away as well; in the middle of harvesting, they left for a lecture tour through <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, New York City, and <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. In its seven months, only 13 people joined, included the Alcotts and Lanes. Other than Abby May and her daughters, only one other woman joined, Ann Page. One rumor is that Page was asked to leave after eating a fish tail with a neighbor. Lane believed Alcott had misled him into thinking enough people would join the enterprise and developed a strong dislike for the <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a>. He quit the project and moved to a nearby <a href="Shakers">Shaker</a> family with his son. After Lane's departure, Alcott fell into a depression and could not speak or eat for three days. Abby May thought Lane purposely sabotaged her family. She wrote to her brother, "All Mr. Lane's efforts have been to disunite us. But Mr. Alcott's ... paternal instincts were too strong for him." When the final payment on the farm was owed, Sam May refused to cover his brother-in-law's debts, as he often did, possibly at Abby May's suggestion. The experiment failed, the Alcotts had to leave Fruitlands.

The members of the Alcott family were not happy with their Fruitlands experience. At one point, Abby May threatened that she and their daughters would move elsewhere, leaving Bronson behind. Louisa May Alcott, who was ten years old at the time, later wrote of the experience in "Transcendental Wild Oats" (1873): "The band of brothers began by spading garden and field; but a few days of it lessened their ardor amazingly."

In January 1844, Alcott moved his family to Still River, a village within Harvard but, on March 1, 1845, the family returned to Concord to live in a home they named "The Hillside" (later renamed "<a href="The%20Wayside">The Wayside</a>" by <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>). Both Emerson and Sam May assisted in securing the home for the Alcotts. While living in the home, Louisa began writing in earnest and was given her own room. She later said her years at the home "were the happiest years" of her life; many of the incidents in her novel "<a href="Little%20Women">Little Women</a>" (1868) are based on this period. Alcott renovated the property, moving a barn and painting the home a rusty olive color, as well as tending to over six acres of land. On May 23, 1845, Abby May was granted a sum from her father's estate which was put into a trust fund, granting minor financial security. That summer, Bronson Alcott let <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> borrow his ax to prepare his home at <a href="Walden%20Pond">Walden Pond</a>.

The Alcotts hosted a steady stream of visitors at The Hillside, including fugitive slaves, which they hosted in secret as a station of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. Alcott's opposition to slavery also fueled his opposition to the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> which began in 1846. He considered the war a blatant attempt to extend slavery and asked if the country was made up of "a people bent on conquest, on getting the golden treasures of Mexico into our hands, and of subjugating foreign peoples?"

In 1848, Abby May insisted they leave Concord, which she called "cold, heartless, brainless, soulless". The Alcott family put The Hillside up for rent and moved to Boston. There, next door to Peabody's book store on West Street, Bronson Alcott hosted a series based on the "Conversations" model by Margaret Fuller called "A Course on the Conversations on Man—his History, Resources, and Expectations". Participants, both men and women, were charged three dollars to attend or five dollars for all seven lectures. In March 1853, Alcott was invited to teach fifteen students at <a href="Harvard%20Divinity%20School">Harvard Divinity School</a> in an extracurricular, non-credit course.

Alcott and his family moved back to Concord after 1857, where he and his family lived in the <a href="Orchard%20House">Orchard House</a> until 1877. In 1860, Alcott was named superintendent of Concord Schools.

Alcott voted in a presidential election for the first time in 1860. In his journal for November 6, 1860, he wrote: "At Town House, and cast my vote for <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a> and the Republican candidates generally—the first vote I ever cast for a President and State officers." Alcott was an abolitionist and a friend of the more radical William Lloyd Garrison. He had attended a rally led by <a href="Wendell%20Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a> on behalf of 17-year-old <a href="Thomas%20Sims">Thomas Sims</a>, a fugitive slave on trial in Boston. Alcott was one of several who attempted to storm the courthouse; when gunshots were heard, he was the only one who stood his ground, though the effort was unsuccessful. He had also stood his ground in a protest against the trial of <a href="Anthony%20Burns">Anthony Burns</a>. A group had broken down the door of the Boston courthouse but guards beat them back. Alcott stood forward and asked the leader of the group, <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%20Higginson">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a>, "Why are we not within?" He then walked calmly into the courthouse, was threatened with a gun, and turned back, "but without hastening a step", according to Higginson.

In 1862, Louisa moved to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to volunteer as a nurse. On January 14, 1863, the Alcotts received a telegram that Louisa was sick; Bronson immediately went to bring her home, briefly meeting Abraham Lincoln while there. Louisa turned her experience into the book "<a href="Hospital%20Sketches">Hospital Sketches</a>". Her father wrote of it, "I see nothing in the way of a good appreciation of Louisa's merits as a woman and a writer."

Henry David Thoreau died on May 6, 1862, likely from an illness he caught from Alcott two years earlier. 
At Emerson's request, Alcott helped arrange Thoreau's funeral, which was held at First Parish Sanctuary in Concord, despite Thoreau having disavowed membership in the church when he was in his early twenties. Emerson wrote a eulogy, and Alcott helped plan the preparations. Only two years later, neighbor Nathaniel Hawthorne died as well. Alcott served as a pallbearer along with <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a>, <a href="James%20Thomas%20Fields">James Thomas Fields</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Sr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, and others. With Hawthorne's death, Alcott worried that few of the Concord notables remained. He recorded in his journal: "Fair figures one by one are fading from sight." The next year, Lincoln was assassinated, which Alcott called "appalling news".

In 1868, Alcott met with publisher Thomas Niles, an admirer of "Hospital Sketches". Alcott asked Niles if he would publish a book of short stories by his daughter; instead, he suggested she write a book about girls. Louisa May was not interested initially but agreed to try. "They want a book of 200 pages or more", Alcott told his daughter. The result was "Little Women", published later that year. The book, which fictionalized the Alcott family during the girls' coming-of-age years, recast the father figure as a chaplain, away from home at the front in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>.

Alcott spoke, as opportunity arose, before the "<a href="lyceum">lyceum</a>s" then common in various parts of the United States, or addressed groups of hearers as they invited him. These "conversations" as he called them, were more or less informal talks on a great range of topics, spiritual, aesthetic and practical, in which he emphasized the ideas of the school of American Transcendentalists led by Emerson, who was always his supporter and discreet admirer. He often discussed Platonic philosophy, the illumination of the mind and soul by direct communion with Spirit; upon the spiritual and poetic monitions of external nature; and upon the benefit to man of a serene mood and a simple way of life.

Alcott's published books, all from late in his life, include "Tablets" (1868), "Concord Days" (1872), "New Connecticut" (1881), and "Sonnets and Canzonets" (1882). Louisa May attended to her father's needs in his final years. She purchased a house for her sister Anna which had been the last home of Henry David Thoreau, now known as the <a href="Thoreau-Alcott%20House">Thoreau-Alcott House</a>. Louisa and her parents moved in with Anna as well.

After the death of his wife Abby May on November 25, 1877, Alcott never returned to Orchard House, too heartbroken to live there. He and Louisa May collaborated on a memoir and went over her papers, letters, and journals. "My heart bleeds with the memories of those days", he wrote, "and even long years, of cheerless anxiety and hopeless dependence." Louisa noted her father had become "restless with his anchor gone". They gave up on the memoir project and Louisa burned many of her mother's papers.

On January 19, 1879, Alcott and <a href="Franklin%20Benjamin%20Sanborn">Franklin Benjamin Sanborn</a> wrote a prospectus for a new school which they distributed to potentially interested people throughout the country. The result was the <a href="Concord%20School%20of%20Philosophy">Concord School of Philosophy</a> and Literature, which held its first session in 1879 in Alcott's study in the <a href="Orchard%20House">Orchard House</a>. In 1880 the school moved to the Hillside Chapel, a building next to the house, where he held conversations and, over the course of successive summers, as he entered his eighties, invited others to give lectures on themes in philosophy, religion and letters. The school, considered one of the first formal adult education centers in America, was also attended by foreign scholars. It continued for nine years.

In April 1882, Alcott's friend and benefactor Ralph Waldo Emerson was sick and bedridden. After visiting him, Alcott wrote, "Concord will be shorn of its human splendor when he withdraws behind the cloud." Emerson died the next day. Alcott himself moved out of Concord for his final years, settling at 10 Louisburg Square in Boston beginning in 1885.

As he was bedridden at the end of his life, Alcott's daughter Louisa May came to visit him at Louisburg on March 1, 1888. He said to her, "I am going "up. Come with me"." She responded, "I wish I could." He died three days later on March 4; Louisa May died only two days after her father.

Alcott was fundamentally and philosophically opposed to <a href="School%20corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> as a means of disciplining his students. Instead, beginning at the Temple School, he would appoint a daily student superintendent. When that student observed an infraction, he or she reported it to the rest of the class and, as a whole, they deliberated on punishment. At times, Alcott offered his own hand for an offending student to strike, saying that any failing was the teacher's responsibility. The shame and guilt this method induced, he believed, was far superior to the fear instilled by corporal punishment; when he used physical "correction" he required that the students be unanimously in support of its application, even including the student to be punished.

The most detailed discussion of his theories on education is in an essay, "Observations on the Principles and Methods of Infant Instruction". Alcott believed that early education must draw out "unpremeditated thoughts and feelings of the child" and emphasized that infancy should primarily focus on enjoyment. He noted that learning was not about the acquisition of facts but the development of a reflective state of mind.

Alcott's ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer <a href="Harriet%20Martineau">Harriet Martineau</a>, for example, wrote dubiously that, "the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth; and that his business is to bring it out into expression". Even so, his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in America, and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education. Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including "teach by encouragement", art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists.

The Concord School of Philosophy, which closed following Alcott's death in 1888, was reopened almost 90 years later in the 1970s. It has continued functioning with a Summer Conversational Series in its original building at Orchard House, now run by the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association.

While many of Alcott's ideas continue to be perceived as being on the liberal/radical edge, they are still common themes in society, including vegetarian/<a href="veganism">veganism</a>, sustainable living, and temperance/self-control. Alcott described his sustenance as a "Pythagorean diet": meat, eggs, butter, cheese, and milk were excluded and drinking was confined to well water. Alcott believed that diet held the key to human perfection and connected physical well-being to mental improvement. He further viewed a perfection of nature to the spirit and, in a sense, predicted modern <a href="environmentalism">environmentalism</a> by condemning <a href="pollution">pollution</a> and encouraging humankind's role in sustaining ecology.

Alcott's philosophical teachings have been criticized as inconsistent, hazy or abrupt. He formulated no system of philosophy, and shows the influence of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, German <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, and <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> as filtered through the writings of <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>. Margaret Fuller referred to Alcott as "a philosopher of the balmy times of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>—a man whom the worldlings of Boston hold in as much horror as the worldlings of Athens held <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>." In his later years, Alcott related a story from his boyhood: during a total <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, he threw rocks at the sky until he fell and dislocated his shoulder. He reflected that the event was a prophecy that he would be "tilting at the sun and always catching the fall".

Like Emerson, Alcott was always optimistic, idealistic, and individualistic in thinking. Writer <a href="James%20Russell%20Lowell">James Russell Lowell</a> referred to Alcott in his poem "Studies for Two Heads" as "an angel with clipped wings". Even so, Emerson noted that Alcott's brilliant conversational ability did not translate into good writing. "When he sits down to write," Emerson wrote, "all his genius leaves him; he gives you the shells and throws away the kernel of his thought." His "Orphic Sayings", published in "The Dial", became famous for their hilarity as dense, pretentious, and meaningless. In New York, for example, "<a href="The%20Knickerbocker">The Knickerbocker</a>" published a parody titled "Gastric Sayings" in November 1840. A writer for the "Boston Post" referred to Alcott's "Orphic Sayings" as "a train of fifteen railroad cars with one passenger".

Modern critics often fault Alcott for not being able to financially support his family. Alcott himself worried about his own prospects as a young man, once writing to his mother that he was "still at my old trade—hoping." Alcott held his principles above his well-being. Shortly before his marriage, for example, his future father-in-law Colonel Joseph May helped him find a job teaching at a school in Boston run by the Society of Free Enquirers, followers of <a href="Robert%20Owen">Robert Owen</a>, for a lucrative $1,000 to $1,200 annual salary. He refused it because he did not agree with their beliefs, writing, "I shall have nothing to do with them."

From the other perspective, Alcott's unique teaching ideas created an environment which produced two famous daughters in different fields, in a time when women were not commonly encouraged to have independent careers.

Arachnophobia

Arachnophobia is a <a href="specific%20phobia">specific phobia</a>: the fear of <a href="spider">spider</a>s and other <a href="arachnid">arachnid</a>s such as <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a>s.

People with arachnophobia tend to feel <a href="anxiety">uneasy</a> in any area they believe could harbor spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as <a href="spider%20web">webs</a>. If arachnophobics see a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a> that is often associated with their phobia. Some people <a href="screaming">scream</a>, <a href="cry">cry</a>, have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, <a href="Perspiration">sweat</a>, have heart palpitations, or even faint when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme cases, even a <a href="picture">picture</a> or a realistic drawing of a spider can <a href="Trauma%20trigger">trigger</a> intense <a href="fear">fear</a>.

An evolutionary reason for the phobias remains unresolved. One view, especially held in <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a>, is that the presence of <a href="venomous%20spiders">venomous spiders</a> led to the evolution of a fear of spiders or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fears of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Spiders, for instance, being relatively small, do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the <a href="animal">animal kingdom</a> where size is a factor, but they can be <a href="Venom%20%28poison%29">venomous</a>.

By ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders, arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments, giving them a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However, having a disproportional fear of spiders in comparison to the other, potentially dangerous creatures that were present during "Homo sapiens"' <a href="Environment%20of%20evolutionary%20adaptedness">environment of evolutionary adaptiveness</a> may have had drawbacks.

Arachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an <a href="instinct">instinct</a>ive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.

Studies have shown that <a href="Cricket%20%28insect%29">crickets</a> can develop a fear of spiders before birth. Research also suggests the widespread fear of spiders may be innate in humans.

The alternative view is that the dangers, such as from spiders, are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution. Instead, inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival, rather than being an aid. For some communities such as in <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a> (except <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>), spiders are included in traditional foods. This suggests arachnophobia may be a cultural, rather than genetic trait.

The <a href="fear%20processing%20in%20the%20brain">fear</a> of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias.

The first line of treatment is <a href="systematic%20desensitization">systematic desensitization</a> – also known as <a href="exposure%20therapy">exposure therapy</a> – which was first described by South African psychiatrist <a href="Joseph%20Wolpe">Joseph Wolpe</a>. In addition, <a href="beta%20blockers">beta blockers</a>, <a href="serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitors">serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> and <a href="benzodiazepines">sedatives</a> are used in the treatment of phobias.

Before engaging in systematic desensitization it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques, which will help keep the patient calm. Systematic desensitization can be done in vivo (with live spiders) or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders, then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders. This technique can be effective in just one session. The discovery of the implication of N-methyl-D-aspartate in fear and fear extinction has led to the use of D-<a href="cycloserine">cycloserine</a>—originally developed as an antibiotic—to augment the results of therapy.

Recent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy. These techniques have proven to be effective.

Arachnophobia affects 3.5 to 6.1 percent of the population.

<doc id="1387" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1387" title="Alabaster">
Alabaster

Alabaster is a <a href="mineral">mineral</a> or rock that is soft and often used for carving, as well as being processed for <a href="plaster">plaster</a> powder. The term is used in different ways by archaeologists and the stone processing industry on the one hand, and geologists on the other. The first use is in a wider meaning, covering varieties of two different minerals: the fine-grained massive type of <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, as well as the fine-grained banded type of <a href="calcite">calcite</a>. <a href="Geology">Geologists</a> only define the gypsum variety as alabaster. Chemically, gypsum is a <a href="Water%20of%20crystallization">hydrous</a> <a href="sulfur">sulfate</a> of <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, while calcite is a <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> of calcium.

Both types of alabaster have broadly similar properties. They are usually light-coloured, translucent and soft stones that have been used throughout human history mainly for carving decorative artifacts.

The calcite variety is also known as onyx-marble, Egyptian alabaster, or Oriental alabaster and is geologically described as either a compact banded <a href="travertine">travertine</a> or "a <a href="stalagmitic">stalagmitic</a> <a href="limestone">limestone</a> marked with patterns of swirling bands of cream and brown". "Onyx-marble" must be understood as a traditional, but geologically inaccurate term, since both <a href="onyx">onyx</a> and <a href="marble">marble</a> have geological definitions distinct from even the widest one applicable for alabaster.

In general (but not always), ancient alabaster is calcite in the wider Middle East, including Egypt and Mesopotamia, while it is gypsum in medieval Europe. Modern alabaster is probably calcite, but may be either. Both are easy to work and slightly water-soluble. They have been used for making a variety of indoor artworks and carvings, as they will not survive long outdoors.

The two kinds are readily distinguished by differences in their hardness: gypsum alabaster is so soft it can be scratched with a fingernail (<a href="Mohs%20scale%20of%20mineral%20hardness">Mohs hardness</a> 1.5 to 2), while calcite cannot be scratched in this way (Mohs hardness 3), although it does yield to a knife. Moreover, calcite alabaster, being a <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>, <a href="effervescence">effervesces</a> when treated with <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, while gypsum alabaster remains nearly unaffected when thus treated.

The origin of the word "alabaster" is in Middle English through Old French "alabastre", in turn derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "alabaster", and that from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "ἀλάβαστρος" ("alabastros") or "ἀλάβαστος" ("alabastos"). The Greek words were used to identify a vase made of alabaster.

This name may be derived further from the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Ancient Egyptian</a> word "a-labaste", which refers to vessels of the Egyptian goddess <a href="Bast%20%28mythology%29">Bast</a>. She was represented as a lioness and frequently depicted as such in figures placed atop these alabaster vessels. Other suggestions include derivation from the town of Alabastron in Egypt, described in sometimes contradictory manner by Roman-era authors <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> ("On Stones") and <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> ("<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>") and whose location is not yet known.

The purest alabaster is a snow-white material of fine uniform grain, but it often is associated with an oxide of <a href="iron">iron</a>, which produces brown clouding and veining in the stone. The coarser varieties of gypsum alabaster are converted by calcination into <a href="plaster%20of%20Paris">plaster of Paris</a>, and are sometimes known as "plaster stone."

The softness of alabaster enables it to be carved readily into elaborate forms, but its solubility in water renders it unsuitable for outdoor work. If alabaster with a smooth, polished surface is washed with <a href="dishwashing%20liquid">dishwashing liquid</a>, it will become rough, dull and whiter, losing most of its translucency and lustre. The finer kinds of alabaster are employed largely as an <a href="stone%20masonry">ornamental stone</a>, especially for <a href="ecclesiastical">ecclesiastical</a> decoration and for the rails of staircases and halls.

Alabaster is mined and then sold in blocks to alabaster workshops. There they are cut to the needed size ("squaring"), and then are processed in different techniques: <a href="Turning">turned</a> on a <a href="lathe">lathe</a> for round shapes, <a href="Stone%20carving">carved</a> into three-dimensional <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>s, <a href="chisel">chisel</a>led to produce <a href="Relief%23Bas-relief%20or%20low%20relief">low relief</a> figures or decoration; and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency, colour, and texture.

In order to diminish the <a href="Translucent">translucency</a> of the alabaster and to produce an opacity suggestive of true marble, the statues are immersed in a bath of water and heated gradually—nearly to the boiling point—an operation requiring great care, because if the temperature is not regulated carefully, the stone acquires a dead-white, chalky appearance. The effect of heating appears to be a partial dehydration of the gypsum. If properly treated, it very closely resembles true marble and is known as "marmo di Castellina".

Alabaster is a porous stone and can be "dyed" into any colour or shade, a technique used for centuries. For this the stone needs to be fully immersed in various pigmentary solutions and heated to a specific temperature. The technique can be used to disguise alabaster. In this way a very misleading imitation of <a href="Coral%20%28precious%29">coral</a> that is called "alabaster coral" is produced.

Typically only one type is sculpted in any particular cultural environment, but sometimes both have been worked to make similar pieces in the same place and time. This was the case with small flasks of the <a href="alabastron">alabastron</a> type made in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> from the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> into the Classical period.

When cut in thin sheets, alabaster is translucent enough to be used for small windows. It was used for this purpose in Byzantine churches and later in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> ones, especially in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Large sheets of Aragonese gypsum alabaster are used extensively in the contemporary <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Angels">Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels</a>, which was dedicated in 2002 by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archbishop%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles, California Archdiocese</a>. The cathedral incorporates special cooling to prevent the panes from overheating and turning opaque. The ancients used the calcite type, while the modern Los Angeles cathedral is using gypsum alabaster.
Calcite alabaster, harder than the gypsum variety, was the kind primarily used in ancient Egypt and the wider Middle East (but not <a href="Assyrian%20palace%20reliefs">Assyrian palace reliefs</a>), and is also used in modern times. It is found as either a <a href="stalagmite">stalagmitic</a> deposit from the floor and walls of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="cavern">cavern</a>s, or as a kind of <a href="travertine">travertine</a>, similarly deposited in springs of calcareous water. Its deposition in successive layers gives rise to the banded appearance that the marble often shows on cross-section, from which its name is derived: onyx-marble or alabaster-onyx, or sometimes simply (and wrongly) as <a href="onyx">onyx</a>.

Egyptian alabaster has been worked extensively near <a href="Suez">Suez</a> and <a href="Assiut">Assiut</a>.

This stone variety is the "alabaster" of the <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ians and <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and is often termed "Oriental alabaster", since the early examples came from the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>. The <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> name "alabastrites" is said to be derived from the town of Alabastron in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, where the stone was quarried. The locality probably owed its name to the mineral; the origin of the mineral name is obscure (though see <a href="Alabaster%23Etymology">above</a>).

The "Oriental" alabaster was highly esteemed for making small perfume bottles or ointment vases called <a href="alabastron">alabastra</a>; the vessel name has been suggested as a possible source of the mineral name. In Egypt, craftsmen used alabaster for <a href="canopic%20jar">canopic jar</a>s and various other sacred and sepulchral objects. A <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> discovered in the tomb of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> near <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> is on display in <a href="Sir%20John%20Soane%27s%20Museum">Sir John Soane's Museum</a>, <a href="London">London</a>; it is carved in a single block of translucent calcite alabaster from Alabastron.

<a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>n onyx-marble has been quarried largely in the province of <a href="Oran">Oran</a>.

In <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, there are famous deposits of a delicate green variety at <a href="La%20Pedrara">La Pedrara</a>, in the district of <a href="Tecali">Tecali</a>, near <a href="Puebla%2C%20Puebla">Puebla</a>. Onyx-marble occurs also in the district of <a href="Tehuac%C3%A1n%20Municipality">Tehuacán</a> and at several localities in the US including <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>.

Gypsum alabaster is the softer of the two varieties, the other being calcite alabaster. It was used primarily in medieval Europe, and is also used in modern times.

"Mosul marble" is a kind of gypsum alabaster found in the north of modern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, which was used for the <a href="Assyrian%20palace%20reliefs">Assyrian palace reliefs</a> of the 9th to 7th centuries BC; these are the largest type of alabaster sculptures to have been regularly made. The relief is very low and the carving detailed, but large rooms were lined with continuous compositions on slabs around 7 foot high. The "<a href="Lion%20Hunt%20of%20Ashurbanipal">Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal</a>" and military <a href="Lachish%20reliefs">Lachish reliefs</a>, both 7th century and in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, are some of the best known.

Gypsum alabaster was very widely used for small <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a> for indoor use in the ancient world, especially in ancient Egypt and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Fine detail could be obtained in a material with an attractive finish without iron or steel tools. Alabaster was used for vessels dedicated for use in the cult of the deity Bast in the culture of the ancient Egyptians, and thousands of gypsum alabaster <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> dating to the late <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">4th millennium BC</a> also have been found in <a href="Tell%20Brak">Tell Brak</a> (present day <a href="Nagar%2C%20Syria">Nagar</a>), in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>.

In Mesopotamia, gypsum alabaster was the typical material for figures of deities and devotees from temples, as in a figure believed to represent the deity, <a href="Abu%20%28god%29">Abu</a>, dating to the first half of the 3rd millennium BC in New York.

Much of the world's alabaster extraction is performed in the centre of the <a href="Ebro%20Valley">Ebro Valley</a> in <a href="Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, which has the world's largest known exploitable deposits. According to a brochure published by the Aragon government, alabaster has elsewhere either been depleted, or its extraction is so difficult that it has almost been abandoned or is carried out at a very high cost. There are two separate sites in Aragon, both are located in <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> basins. The most important site is the Fuentes-<a href="Azaila">Azaila</a> area, in the Tertiary <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a> Basin. The other is the <a href="Calatayud">Calatayud</a>-Teruel Basin, which divides the Iberian Range in two main sectors (NW and SE).

The abundance of Aragonese alabaster was crucial for its use in architecture, sculpture and decoration. There is no record of likely use by pre-Roman cultures, so perhaps the first ones to use alabaster in Aragon were the Romans, who produced vessels from alabaster following the Greek and Egyptian models. It seems that since the reconstruction of the Roman Wall in <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> in the 3rd century AD with alabaster, the use of this material became common in building for centuries. Muslim Saraqusta (today, Zaragoza) was also called "Medina Albaida", the White City, due to the appearance of its alabaster walls and palaces, which stood out among gardens, groves and orchards by the Ebro and Huerva Rivers.

The oldest remains in the <a href="Aljafer%C3%ADa">Aljafería</a> Palace, together with other interesting elements like capitals, reliefs and inscriptions, were made using alabaster, but it was during the artistic and economic blossoming of the Renaissance that Aragonese alabaster reached its Golden Age. In the 16th century sculptors in Aragon chose alabaster for their best works. They were adept at exploiting its lighting qualities and generally speaking the finished art pieces retained their natural color.

In <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, the centre of the alabaster trade today is <a href="Florence%2C%20Italy">Florence, Italy</a>. <a href="Tuscany">Tuscan</a> alabaster occurs in nodular masses embedded in limestone, interstratified with <a href="marl">marl</a>s of <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> and <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> age. The mineral is worked largely by means of underground galleries, in the district of <a href="Volterra">Volterra</a>. Several varieties are recognized—veined, spotted, clouded, agatiform, and others. The finest kind, obtained principally from <a href="Castellina%20Marittima">Castellina</a>, is sent to Florence for figure-sculpture, while the common kinds are carved locally, into vases, lights, and various ornamental objects. These items are objects of extensive trade, especially in Florence, <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, and <a href="Livorno">Livorno</a>.

In the 3rd century BC the <a href="Etruscans">Etruscans</a> used the alabaster of Tuscany from the area of modern-day Volterra to produce <a href="funeral%20urn">funeral urn</a>s, possibly taught by Greek artists. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> the craft of alabaster was almost completely forgotten. A revival started in the mid-16th century, and until the beginning of the 17th century alabaster work was strictly artistic and did not expand to form a large industry.

In the 17th and 18th centuries production of artistic, high-quality Renaissance-style artefacts stopped altogether, being replaced by less sophisticated, cheaper items better suited for large-scale production and commerce. The new industry prospered, but the reduced need of skilled craftsmen left only few still working. The 19th century brought a boom to the industry, largely due to the "travelling artisans" who went and offered their wares to the palaces of Europe, as well as to America and the East.

In the 19th century new processing technology was also introduced, allowing for the production of custom-made, unique pieces, as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials. Apart from the newly developed craft, artistic work became again possible, chiefly by Volterran sculptor <a href="Albino%20Funaioli">Albino Funaioli</a>. After a short slump, the industry was revived again by the sale of mass-produced mannerist <a href="Expressionist">Expressionist</a> sculptures, and was further enhanced in the 1920s by a new branch creating ceiling and wall lamps in the <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style and culminating in the participation at the 1925 <a href="International%20Exposition%20of%20Modern%20Industrial%20and%20Decorative%20Arts">International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts</a> from <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Important names from the evolution of alabaster use after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> are Volterran <a href="Umberto%20Borgna">Umberto Borgna</a>, the "first alabaster designer", and later on the architect and <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a>er <a href="Angelo%20Mangiarotti">Angelo Mangiarotti</a>.

Gypsum alabaster is a common mineral, which occurs in England in the <a href="Keuper">Keuper</a> <a href="marl">marl</a>s of the <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a>, especially at <a href="Chellaston">Chellaston</a> in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, at Fauld in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>, and near <a href="Newark%2C%20England">Newark</a> in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>. Deposits at all of these localities have been worked extensively.

In the 14th and 15th centuries its carving into small statues and sets of <a href="relief">relief</a> panels for <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>s was a valuable <a href="Nottingham%20Alabaster">local industry in Nottingham</a>, as well as a major English export. These were usually painted, or partly painted. It was also used for the effigies, often life size, on <a href="tomb%20monument">tomb monument</a>s, as the typical recumbent position suited the material's lack of strength, and it was cheaper and easier to work than good marble. After the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> the making of altarpiece sets was discontinued, but funerary monument work in reliefs and statues continued.

Besides examples of these carvings still in Britain (especially at the <a href="Nottingham%20Castle%20Museum">Nottingham Castle Museum</a>, <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, and <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>), trade in mineral alabaster (rather than just the antiques trade) has scattered examples in the material that may be found as far afield as the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20Cluny">Musée de Cluny</a>, Spain, and Scandinavia.

Alabaster also is found, although in smaller quantity, at <a href="Watchet">Watchet</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, near <a href="Penarth">Penarth</a> in <a href="Glamorganshire">Glamorganshire</a>, and elsewhere. In <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> it occurs largely in the New Red rocks, but at a lower geological horizon. The alabaster of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire is found in thick nodular beds or "floors" in spheroidal masses known as "balls" or "bowls" and in smaller lenticular masses termed "cakes." At Chellaston, where the local alabaster is known as "Patrick," it has been worked into ornaments under the name of "Derbyshire spar"―a term more properly applied to <a href="fluorspar">fluorspar</a>.

"Black alabaster" is a rare anhydrite form of the gypsum-based mineral. This black form is found in only three veins in the world, one each in <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and <a href="China">China</a>.

<a href="Alabaster%20Caverns%20State%20Park">Alabaster Caverns State Park</a>, near <a href="Freedom%2C%20Oklahoma">Freedom, Oklahoma</a> is home to a natural gypsum cave in which much of the gypsum is in the form of alabaster. There are several types of alabaster found at the site, including pink, white, and the rare black alabaster.

Ahab

Ahab (; ; ; ) was the seventh <a href="king">king</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a> since <a href="Jeroboam%20I">Jeroboam I</a>, the son and successor of <a href="Omri%20%28King%20of%20Israel%29">Omri</a>, and the husband of <a href="Jezebel">Jezebel</a> of <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, according to the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Scriptures</a>. The Hebrew Bible presents Ahab as a wicked king. He is criticised for following the ways of his wife Jezebel, killing his subject <a href="Naboth">Naboth</a>, and leading the nation of Israel into idolatry.

The existence of Ahab is historically supported outside of the Bible. <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a> documented 853 BC that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Qarqar">Battle of Qarqar</a>; one of these was Ahab.

Ahab became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of <a href="Asa%20of%20Judah">Asa, king of Judah</a>, and reigned for twenty-two years, according to 1 Kings. 
<a href="William%20F.%20Albright">William F. Albright</a> dated his reign to 869–850 BC, while <a href="E.%20R.%20Thiele">E. R. Thiele</a> offered the dates 874–853 BC. Most recently, <a href="Michael%20D.%20Coogan">Michael D. Coogan</a> has dated Ahab's reign to 871–852 BC.

<a href="Omri%20%28King%20of%20Israel%29">Omri</a> (Ahab's father and founder of the short-lived <a href="Omrides">Omri Dynasty</a>) seems to have been a successful military leader; he is reported in the text of the Moabite <a href="Mesha%20Stele">Mesha Stele</a> to have "oppressed Moab for many days". During Ahab's reign, <a href="Moab">Moab</a>, which had been conquered by his father, remained tributary. Ahab was allied by marriage with <a href="Jehoshaphat">Jehoshaphat</a>, who was king of <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>. Only with <a href="Aram%20Damascus">Aram Damascus</a> is he believed to have had strained relations.

Ahab married <a href="Jezebel">Jezebel</a>, the daughter of the King of Tyre. 1 Kings 16–22 tells the story of Ahab and Jezebel, and indicates that Jezebel was a dominant influence on Ahab and strove to spread idol worship of <a href="Baal">Baal</a> in Israel. Ahab was succeeded by <a href="Ahaziah%20of%20Israel">Ahaziah</a> and <a href="Jehoram%20of%20Israel">Jehoram</a>, who reigned over Israel until Jehu's revolt of 842 BC.
The <a href="Battle%20of%20Qarqar">Battle of Qarqar</a> is mentioned in extra-biblical records, and was perhaps at <a href="Apamea%20%28Syria%29">Apamea</a>, where <a href="Shalmaneser%20III">Shalmaneser III</a> of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> fought a great confederation of princes from <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, Northern <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, Israel, <a href="Ammon">Ammon</a>, and the tribes of the Syrian desert (853 BC), including Ahab the Israelite ("A-ha-ab-bu Sir-'a-la-a-a") and <a href="Hadadezer">Hadadezer</a> ("Adad-'idri").

Ahab's contribution was estimated at 2,000 <a href="chariot">chariot</a>s and 10,000 men. In reality, however, the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found). If, however, the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from <a href="Tyre%20%28Lebanon%29">Tyre</a>, Judah, <a href="Edom">Edom</a>, and Moab. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown <a href="Hadadezer">Ben-hadad</a> and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to <a href="Samaria">Samaria</a>, and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at <a href="Aphek%20%28biblical%29">Aphek</a>, probably in the <a href="plain%20of%20Sharon">plain of Sharon</a> at <a href="Antipatris">Antipatris</a> (1 Kings 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father, and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.

<a href="Jezreel%20%28city%29">Jezreel</a> has been identified as Ahab's fortified chariot and cavalry base.

In the Biblical text, Ahab has five important encounters with prophets. 
The first encounter is with <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a>, whom Ahab refers to as "the troubler of Israel" (1 Kings 18:17), in which Elijah predicts a drought (1 Kings 17:1). This encounter ends with Elijah victorious over the official <a href="Baal">Baal</a> prophets of Israel in a contest held for the sake of the Israelites and their king, Ahab. The contest ends when Elijah's God consumes the offering which the Baal worshipers could not induce their god to touch, after which Elijah slaughters the Baal prophets (1 Kings 18:17–40). The second encounter is between Ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 20:22. The third is again between Ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns Ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place (1 Kings 20:34-43). The fourth is when Elijah confronts Ahab over Ahab's and Jezebel's execution of Naboth and usurpation of the latter's ancestral vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-16). Upon the prophet's remonstration ("Hast thou killed and also taken possession?" (1 Kings, 21:19)), Ahab displayed sincere remorse (1 Kings 21:27). The fifth encounter is with <a href="Micaiah">Micaiah</a>, the prophet who, when asked for advice on a military campaign, first assures Ahab he will be successful and ultimately gives Ahab a glimpse into God's plan for Ahab to die in battle (1 Kings 22).

Three years later, war broke out east of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>, and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramoth-Gilead">Ramoth-Gilead</a> from the Arameans. During this battle Ahab disguised himself, but was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also licked his blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons, <a href="Ahaziah%20of%20Israel">Ahaziah</a> and <a href="Jehoram%20of%20Israel">Jehoram</a>.

Jezebel's death, however, was more dramatic than Ahab's. As recorded in 2 Kings 9:30-34, Jezebel was confronted by Jehu who had her servants <a href="Defenestration">throw her out the window</a>, causing her death.

1 Kings 16:29 through 22:40 contains the story of Ahab's reign. This reign is one which faces opposition from several prophets of <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> throughout as well as various consequences because of his marriage to Jezebel, because of his worship of Baal, disobedience to prophetic warnings and words, and also because of the murder of Naboth. The murder of <a href="Naboth">Naboth</a> (see <a href="Jezebel%20%28biblical%29">Jezebel</a>), an act of royal encroachment, stirred up popular resentment just as the new cult aroused the opposition of the Israelite prophets, including Elijah and Micaiah. Indeed, he is referred to, for this and other things, as being "more evil than all the kings before him" (1 Kings 16:30). The followers of Yahweh found their champion in Elijah. His denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on <a href="Mount%20Carmel">Mount Carmel</a> (1 Kings 18), form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of <a href="Jehu">Jehu</a>, an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple <a href="Elisha">Elisha</a> was the leading figure.

Dasyproctidae

Dasyproctidae is a family of large <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, comprising the <a href="agouti">agouti</a>s and <a href="acouchi">acouchi</a>s. Their fur is a reddish or dark colour above, with a paler underside. They are <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, often feeding on ripe <a href="fruit">fruit</a> that falls from trees. They live in burrows, and, like <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, will bury some of their food for later use.

Dasyproctids exist in Central and South America, which are the tropical parts of the new world. The fossil record of this family can be traced back to the Oligocene period (34-23 million years ago). 

As with all rodents, members of this family have incisors, pre-molars, and molars, but no canines. The cheek teeth are <a href="hypsodonty">hypsodont</a> and flat-crowned.

Fossil taxa follow McKenna and Bell, with modifications following Kramarz.


The <a href="paca">paca</a>s (genus "Cuniculus") are placed by some authorities in Dasyproctidae, but molecular studies have demonstrated they do not form a monophyletic group.

Algol

Algol, designated Beta Persei (β Persei, abbreviated Beta Per, β Per), known colloquially as the Demon Star, is a bright <a href="multiple%20star">multiple star</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Perseus%20%28constellation%29">Perseus</a>. It is the first and best known <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a>, and one of the first non-<a href="nova">nova</a> <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>s to be discovered. It is a three-star system, consisting of Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab - in which the large and bright primary β Persei Aa1 is regularly eclipsed by the dimmer β Persei Aa2. Thus, Algol's <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days (2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes) during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. There is also a secondary eclipse (the "second minimum") when the brighter star <a href="occultation">occults</a> the fainter secondary. This secondary eclipse can only be detected photoelectrically.

Algol gives its name to its class of eclipsing variable, known as <a href="Algol%20variable">Algol variable</a>s.

An Ancient Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days composed some 3,200 years ago is claimed to be the oldest historical document of the discovery of Algol.
The association of Algol with a demon-like creature (<a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> in the Greek tradition, <a href="ghoul">ghoul</a> in the Arabic tradition) suggests that its variability was known long before the 17th century, but except for the Ancient Egyptian discovery there is still no indisputable evidence for this.

The variability of Algol was noted in 1667 by Italian astronomer <a href="Geminiano%20Montanari">Geminiano Montanari</a>, but the periodic nature of its variations in brightness was not recognized until more than a century later, when the British amateur astronomer <a href="John%20Goodricke">John Goodricke</a> also proposed a mechanism for the star's variability. In May 1783, he presented his findings to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, suggesting that the periodic variability was caused by a dark body passing in front of the star (or else that the star itself has a darker region that is periodically turned toward the Earth). For his report he was awarded the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a>.

In 1881, the Harvard astronomer <a href="Edward%20Charles%20Pickering">Edward Charles Pickering</a> presented evidence that Algol was actually an eclipsing binary. This was confirmed a few years later, in 1889, when the Potsdam astronomer <a href="Hermann%20Carl%20Vogel">Hermann Carl Vogel</a> found periodic <a href="doppler%20shift">doppler shift</a>s in the spectrum of Algol, inferring variations in the <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> of this binary system. Thus Algol became one of the first known <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binaries</a>. <a href="Joel%20Stebbins">Joel Stebbins</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20Observatory">University of Illinois Observatory</a> used an early selenium cell photometer to produce the first-ever photoelectric study of a variable star. The light curve revealed the second minimum and the reflection effect between the two stars.
Some difficulties in explaining the observed spectroscopic features led to the conjecture that a third star may be present in the system; four decades later this conjecture was found to be correct.

From the point of view of the Earth, Algol Aa1 and Algol Aa2 form an <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a> because their <a href="orbital%20plane%20%28astronomy%29">orbital plane</a> contains the <a href="line-of-sight%20propagation">line of sight</a> to the Earth. To be more precise, Algol is a triple-star system: the eclipsing binary pair is separated by only 0.062 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (au) from each other, whereas the third star in the system (Algol Ab) is at an average distance of 2.69 au from the pair, and the mutual <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a> of the trio is 681 Earth days. The total mass of the system is about 5.8 solar masses, and the mass ratios of Aa1, Aa2, and Ab are about 4.5 to 1 to 2.

The three components of the bright triple star used to be, and still sometimes are, referred to as β Per A, B, and C. The <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">Washington Double Star Catalog</a> lists them as Aa1, Aa2, and An, with two very faint stars B and C about one <a href="arcmin">arcmin</a> distant. A further five faint stars are also listed as companions.

Studies of Algol led to the <a href="Algol%20paradox">Algol paradox</a> in the theory of <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a>: although components of a binary star form at the same time, and massive stars evolve much faster than the less massive stars, the more massive component Algol A is still in the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>, but the less massive Algol B is a <a href="subgiant%20star">subgiant star</a> at a later evolutionary stage. The paradox can be solved by <a href="mass%20transfer">mass transfer</a>: when the more massive star became a subgiant, it filled its <a href="Roche%20lobe">Roche lobe</a>, and most of the mass was transferred to the other star, which is still in the main sequence. In some binaries similar to Algol, a gas flow can be seen.

This system also exhibits <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a> and <a href="radio%20wave">radio wave</a> flares. The x-ray flares are thought to be caused by the magnetic fields of the A and B components interacting with the mass transfer. The radio-wave flares might be created by magnetic cycles similar to those of <a href="sunspot">sunspot</a>s, but because the magnetic fields of these stars are up to ten times stronger than the field of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, these radio flares are more powerful and more persistent.

Magnetic activity cycles in the chromospherically active secondary component induce changes in its radius of gyration that have been linked to recurrent orbital period variations on the order of  ≈ 10 via the <a href="Applegate%20mechanism">Applegate mechanism</a>. <a href="Mass%20transfer%23Astrophysics">Mass transfer</a> between the components is small in the Algol system but could be a significant source of period change in other <a href="Algol%20variable">Algol-type binaries</a>.

Algol is about 92.8 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from the Sun, but about 7.3 million years ago it passed within 9.8 light-years of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> and its <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> was about −2.5, which is considerably brighter than the star <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> is today. Because the total mass of the Algol system is about 5.8 solar masses, at the closest approach this might have given enough <a href="gravity">gravity</a> to <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturb</a> the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a> of the Solar System somewhat and hence increase the number of <a href="comet">comet</a>s entering the inner Solar System. However, the actual increase in net cometary collisions is thought to have been quite small.

"Beta Persei" is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. The name "Algol" derives from <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> "raʾs al-ghūl" : head ("raʾs") of the ogre ("al-ghūl") (see "<a href="ghoul">ghoul</a>"). The English name ""Demon Star"" is a direct translation of this. In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Algol" for this star. It is so entered on the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In Hebrew folklore, Algol was called "Rōsh ha Sāṭān" or "Satan's Head", as stated by <a href="Edmund%20Chilmead">Edmund Chilmead</a>, who called it "Divels head" or "Rosch hassatan". A <a href="Latin">Latin</a> name for Algol from the 16th century was "Caput Larvae" or "the Spectre's Head". <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> made this a separate, though connected, constellation.

In <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>, (), meaning "<a href="Stomach%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Mausoleum</a>", refers to an asterism consisting of β Persei, <a href="9%20Persei">9 Persei</a>, <a href="Tau%20Persei">τ Persei</a>, <a href="Iota%20Persei">ι Persei</a>, <a href="Kappa%20Persei">κ Persei</a>, <a href="Rho%20Persei">ρ Persei</a>, <a href="16%20Persei">16 Persei</a> and <a href="12%20Persei">12 Persei</a>. Consequently, β Persei itself is known as (, English: The Fifth Star of Mausoleum.). According to R.H. Allen the star bore the grim name of "Tseih She" (), meaning "Piled up Corpses" but this appears to be a misidentification, and "Dié Shī" is correctly <a href="Pi%20Persei">π Persei</a>, which is inside the Mausoleum.

Historically, the star has received a strong association with bloody violence across a wide variety of cultures. In the "<a href="Tetrabiblos">Tetrabiblos</a>", the 2nd-century astrological text of the Alexandrian astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, Algol is referred to as "the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> of <a href="Perseus%20%28constellation%29">Perseus</a>" and associated with death by decapitation: a theme which mirrors the myth of the hero <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a>'s victory over the snake-haired <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>. <a href="Astrology">Astrologically</a>, Algol is considered one of the <a href="luck">unluckiest</a> stars in the sky, and was listed as one of the 15 <a href="Behenian%20fixed%20star">Behenian stars</a>.

Amazing Grace

"Amazing Grace" is a <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="hymn">hymn</a> published in 1779, with words written by the English poet and Anglican clergyman <a href="John%20Newton">John Newton</a> (1725–1807).

Newton wrote the words from personal experience. He grew up without any particular religious conviction, but his life's path was formed by a variety of twists and coincidences that were often put into motion by his recalcitrant insubordination. He was <a href="Impressment">pressed</a> (conscripted) into service in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and after leaving the service, he became involved in the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a>. In 1748, a violent storm battered his vessel off the coast of <a href="County%20Donegal">County Donegal</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, so severely that he called out to God for mercy, a moment that marked <a href="John%20Newton%23Spiritual%20conversion">his spiritual conversion</a>. He continued his slave trading career until 1754 or 1755, when he ended his seafaring altogether and began studying <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian theology</a>.

Ordained in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> in 1764, Newton became <a href="curate">curate</a> of <a href="Olney%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Olney, Buckinghamshire</a>, where he began to write hymns with poet <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>. "Amazing Grace" was written to illustrate a sermon on New Year's Day of 1773. It is unknown if there was any music accompanying the verses; it may have simply been chanted by the congregation. It debuted in print in 1779 in Newton and Cowper's "<a href="Olney%20Hymns">Olney Hymns</a>" but settled into relative obscurity in England. In the United States, however, "Amazing Grace" was used extensively during the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> in the early 19th century. It has been associated with more than 20 melodies, but in 1835 it was joined to a tune named "New Britain" to which it is most frequently sung today. 

With the message that forgiveness and redemption are possible regardless of sins committed and that the soul can be delivered from despair through the mercy of God, "Amazing Grace" is one of the most recognizable songs in the English-speaking world. Author <a href="Gilbert%20Chase">Gilbert Chase</a> writes that it is "without a doubt the most famous of all the folk hymns", and Jonathan Aitken, a Newton biographer, estimates that it is performed about 10 million times annually. It has had particular influence in <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, and has become an emblematic <a href="Negro%20spiritual">African American spiritual</a>. Its universal message has been a significant factor in its crossover into secular music. "Amazing Grace" saw a resurgence in popularity in the U.S. during the 1960s and has been recorded thousands of times during and since the 20th century, occasionally appearing on popular music charts.

According to the "Dictionary of American Hymnology" "Amazing Grace" is <a href="John%20Newton">John Newton</a>'s spiritual autobiography in verse.

In 1725, Newton was born in <a href="Wapping">Wapping</a>, a district in London near the <a href="Thames">Thames</a>. His father was a shipping merchant who was brought up as a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> but had <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> sympathies, and his mother was a devout Independent unaffiliated with the <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a>. She had intended Newton to become a clergyman, but she died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> when he was six years old. For the next few years, Newton was raised by his emotionally distant stepmother while his father was at sea, and spent some time at a boarding school where he was mistreated. At the age of eleven, he joined his father on a ship as an <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a>; his seagoing career would be marked by headstrong disobedience.

As a youth, Newton began a pattern of coming very close to death, examining his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed "Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times", a book by the <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">Third Earl of Shaftesbury</a>, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, "Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a> at the very time when every other comfort was about to fail me." His disobedience caused him to be <a href="Impressment">pressed</a> into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary "Polly" Catlett, a family friend with whom he had fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.

Newton often openly mocked the captain by creating obscene poems and songs about him that became so popular the crew began to join in. He entered into disagreements with several colleagues that resulted in his being starved almost to death, imprisoned while at sea and chained like the slaves they carried, then outright enslaved and forced to work on a plantation in <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> near the <a href="Sherbro%20River">Sherbro River</a>. After several months he came to think of Sierra Leone as his home, but his father intervened after Newton sent him a letter describing his circumstances, and a ship found him by coincidence. Newton claimed the only reason he left was because of Polly.

While aboard the ship "Greyhound", Newton gained notoriety for being one of the most profane men the captain had ever met. In a culture where sailors commonly used oaths and swore, Newton was admonished several times for not only using the worst words the captain had ever heard, but creating new ones to exceed the limits of verbal debauchery. In March 1748, while the "Greyhound" was in the North Atlantic, a violent storm came upon the ship that was so rough it swept overboard a crew member who was standing where Newton had been moments before. After hours of the crew emptying water from the ship and expecting to be capsized, Newton and another mate tied themselves to the ship's pump to keep from being washed overboard, working for several hours. After proposing the measure to the captain, Newton had turned and said, "If this will not do, then Lord have mercy upon us!" Newton rested briefly before returning to the deck to steer for the next eleven hours. During his time at the wheel he pondered his divine challenge.

About two weeks later, the battered ship and starving crew landed in <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly, Ireland</a>. For several weeks before the storm, Newton had been reading "The Christian's Pattern", a summary of the 15th-century "<a href="The%20Imitation%20of%20Christ%20%28book%29">The Imitation of Christ</a>" by <a href="Thomas%20%C3%A0%20Kempis">Thomas à Kempis</a>. The memory of his own "Lord have mercy upon us!" uttered during a moment of desperation in the storm did not leave him; he began to ask if he was worthy of God's mercy or in any way redeemable as he had not only neglected his faith but directly opposed it, mocking others who showed theirs, deriding and denouncing God as a myth. He came to believe that God had sent him a profound message and had begun to work through him.

Newton's conversion was not immediate, but he contacted Polly's family and announced his intentions to marry her. Her parents were hesitant as he was known to be unreliable and impetuous. They knew he was profane, but they allowed him to write to Polly, and he set to begin to submit to authority for her sake. He sought a place on a slave ship bound for Africa, and Newton and his crewmates participated in most of the same activities he had written about before; the only immorality from which he was able to free himself was profanity. After a severe illness his resolve was renewed, yet he retained the same attitude towards slavery as was held by his contemporaries. Newton continued in the slave trade through several voyages where he sailed up rivers in Africa now as a captain procured slaves being offered for sale in larger ports, and subsequently transported them to North America. In between voyages, he married Polly in 1750 and he found it more difficult to leave her at the beginning of each trip. After three shipping experiences in the slave trade, Newton was promised a position as ship's captain with cargo unrelated to slavery when, at the age of thirty, he collapsed and never sailed again.

Working as a <a href="customs">customs</a> agent in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> starting in 1756, Newton began to teach himself Latin, Greek, and theology. He and Polly immersed themselves in the church community, and Newton's passion was so impressive that his friends suggested he become a priest in the Church of England. He was turned down by <a href="John%20Gilbert%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">John Gilbert</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, in 1758, ostensibly for having no university degree, although the more likely reasons were his leanings toward <a href="evangelism">evangelism</a> and tendency to socialize with <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>s. Newton continued his devotions, and after being encouraged by a friend, he wrote about his experiences in the slave trade and his conversion. <a href="George%20Legge%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Dartmouth">George Legge, 3rd Earl of Dartmouth</a>, impressed with his story, sponsored Newton for ordination by <a href="John%20Green%20%28bishop%29">John Green</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, and offered him the <a href="curate">curacy</a> of <a href="Olney%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Olney, Buckinghamshire</a>, in 1764.

Olney was a village of about 2,500 residents whose main industry was making lace by hand. The people were mostly illiterate and many of them were poor. Newton's preaching was unique in that he shared many of his own experiences from the pulpit; many clergy preached from a distance, not admitting any intimacy with temptation or sin. He was involved in his parishioners' lives and was much loved, although his writing and delivery were sometimes unpolished. But his devotion and conviction were apparent and forceful, and he often said his mission was to "break a hard heart and to heal a broken heart". He struck a friendship with <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>, a gifted writer who had failed at a career in law and suffered bouts of insanity, attempting suicide several times. Cowper enjoyed Olney and Newton's company; he was also new to Olney and had gone through a spiritual conversion similar to Newton's. Together, their effect on the local congregation was impressive. In 1768, they found it necessary to start a weekly prayer meeting to meet the needs of an increasing number of parishioners. They also began writing lessons for children.

Partly from Cowper's literary influence, and partly because learned vicars were expected to write verses, Newton began to try his hand at hymns, which had become popular through the language, made plain for common people to understand. Several prolific hymn writers were at their most productive in the 18th century, including <a href="Isaac%20Watts">Isaac Watts</a> whose hymns Newton had grown up hearing and <a href="Charles%20Wesley">Charles Wesley</a>, with whom Newton was familiar. Wesley's brother <a href="John%20Wesley">John</a>, the eventual founder of the Methodist Church, had encouraged Newton to go into the clergy. Watts was a pioneer in English hymn writing, basing his work after the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>. The most prevalent hymns by Watts and others were written in the <a href="common%20meter">common meter</a> in 8.6.8.6: the first line is eight syllables and the second is six.

Newton and Cowper attempted to present a poem or hymn for each prayer meeting. The lyrics to "Amazing Grace" were written in late 1772 and probably used in a prayer meeting for the first time on January 1, 1773. A collection of the poems Newton and Cowper had written for use in services at Olney was bound and published anonymously in 1779 under the title "<a href="Olney%20Hymns">Olney Hymns</a>". Newton contributed 280 of the 348 texts in "Olney Hymns"; "1 Chronicles 17:16–17, Faith's Review and Expectation" was the title of the poem with the first line "Amazing grace! (how sweet the sound)".

The general impact of "Olney Hymns" was immediate and it became a widely popular tool for evangelicals in Britain for many years. Scholars appreciated Cowper's poetry somewhat more than Newton's plaintive and plain language driven from his forceful personality. The most prevalent themes in the verses written by Newton in "Olney Hymns" are faith in salvation, wonder at <a href="Grace%20%28Christianity%29">God's grace</a>, his love for Jesus, and his cheerful exclamations of the joy he found in his faith. As a reflection of Newton's connection to his parishioners, he wrote many of the hymns in <a href="first-person%20narrative">first person</a>, admitting his own experience with sin. Bruce Hindmarsh in "Sing Them Over Again To Me: Hymns and Hymnbooks in America" considers "Amazing Grace" an excellent example of Newton's testimonial style afforded by the use of this perspective. Several of Newton's hymns were recognized as great work ("Amazing Grace" was not among them) while others seem to have been included to fill in when Cowper was unable to write. Jonathan Aitken calls Newton, specifically referring to "Amazing Grace", an "unashamedly middlebrow lyricist writing for a lowbrow congregation", noting that only twenty-one of the nearly 150 words used in all six verses have more than one syllable.

William Phipps in the "<a href="Anglican%20Theological%20Review">Anglican Theological Review</a>" and author James Basker have interpreted the first stanza of "Amazing Grace" as evidence of Newton's realization that his participation in the slave trade was his wretchedness, perhaps representing a wider common understanding of Newton's motivations. Newton joined forces with a young man named <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, the British Member of Parliament who led the Parliamentarian campaign to abolish the slave trade in the British Empire, culminating in the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">Slave Trade Act 1807</a>. However, Newton became an ardent and outspoken <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a> after he left Olney in the 1780s; he never connected the construction of the hymn that became "Amazing Grace" to anti-slavery sentiments. The lyrics in "Olney Hymns" were arranged by their association to the Biblical verses that would be used by Newton and Cowper in their prayer meetings and did not address any political objective. For Newton, the beginning of the year was a time to reflect on one's spiritual progress. At the same time he completed a diary which has since been lost that he had begun 17 years before, two years after he quit sailing. The last entry of 1772 was a recounting of how much he had changed since then.

The title ascribed to the hymn, "<a href="1%20Chronicles">1 Chronicles</a> 17:16–17", refers to <a href="David">David</a>'s reaction to the prophet <a href="Nathan%20%28prophet%29">Nathan</a> telling him that God intends to maintain his family line forever. Some Christians interpret this as a prediction that Jesus Christ, as a descendant of David, was promised by God as the salvation for all people. Newton's sermon on that January day in 1773 focused on the necessity to express one's gratefulness for God's guidance, that God is involved in the daily lives of Christians though they may not be aware of it, and that patience for deliverance from the daily trials of life is warranted when the glories of eternity await. Newton saw himself a sinner like David who had been chosen, perhaps undeservedly, and was humbled by it. According to Newton, unconverted sinners were "blinded by the god of this world" until "mercy came to us not only undeserved but undesired ... our hearts endeavored to shut him out till he overcame us by the power of his grace."

The <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> served as the basis for many of the lyrics of "Amazing Grace". The first verse, for example, can be traced to the story of the <a href="Prodigal%20Son">Prodigal Son</a>. In the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> the father says, "For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost, and is found". The story of Jesus <a href="Miracles%20of%20Jesus%23The%20blind">healing a blind man</a> who tells the <a href="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> that he can now see is told in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>. Newton used the words "I was blind but now I see" and declared "Oh to grace how great a debtor!" in his letters and diary entries as early as 1752. The effect of the lyrical arrangement, according to Bruce Hindmarsh, allows an instant release of energy in the exclamation "Amazing grace!", to be followed by a qualifying reply in "how sweet the sound". In "An Annotated Anthology of Hymns", Newton's use of an exclamation at the beginning of his verse is called "crude but effective" in an overall composition that "suggest(s) a forceful, if simple, statement of faith". Grace is recalled three times in the following verse, culminating in Newton's most personal story of his conversion, underscoring the use of his personal testimony with his parishioners.

The sermon preached by Newton was his last, of those that William Cowper heard in Olney, since Cowper's mental instability returned shortly thereafter. Steve Turner, author of "Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song", suggests Newton may have had his friend in mind, employing the themes of assurance and deliverance from despair for Cowper's benefit.

Although it had its roots in England, "Amazing Grace" became an integral part of the Christian tapestry in the United States. More than 60 of Newton and Cowper's hymns were republished in other British hymnals and magazines, but "Amazing Grace" was not, appearing only once in a 1780 hymnal sponsored by the <a href="Selina%20Hastings%2C%20Countess%20of%20Huntingdon">Countess of Huntingdon</a>. Scholar <a href="John%20D.%20Julian">John Julian</a> commented in his 1892 "<a href="A%20Dictionary%20of%20Hymnology">A Dictionary of Hymnology</a>" that outside of the United States, the song was unknown and it was "far from being a good example of Newton's finest work". Between 1789 and 1799, four variations of Newton's hymn were published in the U.S. in <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a href="Dutch%20Reformed">Dutch Reformed</a>, and <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a> hymnodies; by 1830 <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>s and <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>s also included Newton's verses in their hymnals.

The greatest influences in the 19th century that propelled "Amazing Grace" to spread across the U.S. and become a staple of religious services in many denominations and regions were the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> and the development of <a href="shape%20note">shape note</a> singing communities. A tremendous religious movement swept the U.S. in the early 19th century, marked by the growth and popularity of churches and religious revivals that got their start in Kentucky and Tennessee. Unprecedented gatherings of thousands of people attended camp meetings where they came to experience salvation; preaching was fiery and focused on saving the sinner from temptation and backsliding. Religion was stripped of ornament and ceremony, and made as plain and simple as possible; sermons and songs often used repetition to get across to a rural population of poor and mostly uneducated people the necessity of turning away from sin. Witnessing and testifying became an integral component to these meetings, where a congregation member or even a stranger would rise and recount his turn from a sinful life to one of piety and peace. "Amazing Grace" was one of many hymns that punctuated fervent sermons, although the contemporary style used a refrain, borrowed from other hymns, that employed simplicity and repetition such as:

Simultaneously, an unrelated movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds to symbolize the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound was accompanied by a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a <a href="Calvinism">Calvinistic</a> sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>.

When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in "A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns" (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune "Hephzibah" by English composer John Jenkins Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of "Amazing Grace" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when <a href="William%20Walker%20%28composer%29">William Walker</a> assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named "New Britain", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies ("Gallaher" and "St. Mary") first published in the "Columbian Harmony" by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a>, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy "the wants of the Church in her triumphal march". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but "Gallaher" and "St. Mary" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by <a href="Lucius%20Chapin">Lucius Chapin</a>, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to "St. Mary", but that does not mean that he wrote it.

"Amazing Grace", with the words written by Newton and joined with "New Britain", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook "<a href="Southern%20Harmony">Southern Harmony</a>" in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a "marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness." Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about 600,000 copies all over the U.S. when the total population was just over 20 million. Another shape note tunebook named "<a href="The%20Sacred%20Harp">The Sacred Harp</a>" (1844) by Georgia residents <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20White">Benjamin Franklin White</a> and Elisha J. King became widely influential and continues to be used.

Another verse was first recorded in <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s immensely influential 1852 anti-slavery novel "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>". Three verses were emblematically sung by Tom in his hour of deepest crisis. He sings the sixth and fifth verses in that order, and Stowe included another verse not written by Newton that had been passed down orally in African American communities for at least 50 years. It was originally one of between 50 and 70 verses of a song titled "Jerusalem, My Happy Home" that first appeared in a 1790 book called "A Collection of Sacred Ballads":

"Amazing Grace" came to be an emblem of a Christian movement and a symbol of the U.S. itself as the country was involved in a great political experiment, attempting to employ democracy as a means of government. Shape note singing communities, with all the members sitting around an open center, each song employing a different director, illustrated this in practice. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to expand westward into previously unexplored territory that was often wilderness. The "dangers, toils, and snares" of Newton's lyrics had both literal and figurative meanings for Americans. This became poignantly true during the most serious test of American cohesion in the <a href="U.S.%20Civil%20War">U.S. Civil War</a> (1861–1865). "Amazing Grace" set to "New Britain" was included in two hymnals distributed to soldiers and with death so real and imminent, religious services in the military became commonplace. The hymn was translated into other languages as well: while on the <a href="Trail%20of%20Tears">Trail of Tears</a>, the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> sang Christian hymns as a way of coping with the ongoing tragedy, and a version of the song by <a href="Samuel%20Worcester">Samuel Worcester</a> that had been translated into the <a href="Cherokee%20language">Cherokee language</a> became very popular.

Although "Amazing Grace" set to "New Britain" was popular, other versions existed regionally. <a href="Primitive%20Baptist">Primitive Baptist</a>s in the Appalachian region often used "New Britain" with other hymns, and sometimes sing the words of "Amazing Grace" to other folk songs, including titles such as "<a href="In%20the%20Pines">In the Pines</a>", "Pisgah", "Primrose", and "Evan", as all are able to be sung in common meter, of which the majority of their repertoire consists. A tune named "Arlington" accompanied Newton's verses as much as "New Britain" for a time in the late 19th century.

Two musical arrangers named <a href="Dwight%20Moody">Dwight Moody</a> and <a href="Ira%20Sankey">Ira Sankey</a> heralded another religious revival in the cities of the U.S. and Europe, giving the song international exposure. Moody's preaching and Sankey's musical gifts were significant; their arrangements were the forerunners of <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>, and churches all over the U.S. were eager to acquire them. Moody and Sankey began publishing their compositions in 1875, and "Amazing Grace" appeared three times with three different melodies, but they were the first to give it its title; hymns were typically published using the first line of the lyrics, or the name of the tune such as "New Britain". A publisher named <a href="Edwin%20Othello%20Excell">Edwin Othello Excell</a> gave the version of "Amazing Grace" set to "New Britain" immense popularity by publishing it in a series of hymnals that were used in urban churches. Excell altered some of Walker's music, making it more contemporary and European, giving "New Britain" some distance from its rural folk-music origins. Excell's version was more palatable for a growing urban middle class and arranged for larger church choirs. Several editions featuring Newton's first three stanzas and the verse previously included by Harriet Beecher Stowe in "Uncle Tom's Cabin" were published by Excell between 1900 and 1910, and his version of "Amazing Grace" became the standard form of the song in American churches.

With the advent of recorded music and radio, "Amazing Grace" began to cross over from primarily a gospel standard to secular audiences. The ability to record combined with the marketing of records to specific audiences allowed "Amazing Grace" to take on thousands of different forms in the 20th century. Where Edwin Othello Excell sought to make the singing of "Amazing Grace" uniform throughout thousands of churches, records allowed artists to improvise with the words and music specific to each audience. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> lists more than 7,000 recordings including re-releases and compilations as of September 2011. Its first recording is an <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> version from 1922 by the Sacred Harp Choir. It was included from 1926 to 1930 in <a href="Okeh%20Records">Okeh Records</a>' catalogue, which typically concentrated strongly on blues and jazz. Demand was high for black gospel recordings of the song by H. R. Tomlin and <a href="J.%20M.%20Gates">J. M. Gates</a>. A poignant sense of nostalgia accompanied the recordings of several gospel and blues singers in the 1940s and 1950s who used the song to remember their grandparents, traditions, and family roots. It was recorded with musical accompaniment for the first time in 1930 by <a href="Fiddlin%27%20John%20Carson">Fiddlin' John Carson</a>, although to another folk hymn named "At the Cross", not to "New Britain". "Amazing Grace" is emblematic of several kinds of folk music styles, often used as the standard example to illustrate such musical techniques as <a href="lining%20out">lining out</a> and <a href="call%20and%20response">call and response</a>, that have been practiced in both black and white folk music.

<a href="Mahalia%20Jackson">Mahalia Jackson</a>'s 1947 version received significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew throughout the 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public events such as concerts at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the "paradigmatic Negro spiritual" because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries. Anthony Heilbut, author of "The Gospel Sound", states that the "dangers, toils, and snares" of Newton's words are a "universal testimony" of the African American experience. During the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and <a href="opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">opposition to the Vietnam War</a>, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed "Amazing Grace" for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it "to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend ... I was not sure the magic worked outside the church walls ... in the open air of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances." Folk singer <a href="Judy%20Collins">Judy Collins</a>, who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed <a href="Fannie%20Lou%20Hamer">Fannie Lou Hamer</a> leading marchers in <a href="Freedom%20Summer">Mississippi in 1964</a>, singing "Amazing Grace". Collins also considered it a <a href="wikt%3Atalisman">talisman</a> of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, it was one of the most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had "developed a life of its own". It even made an appearance at the <a href="Woodstock%20Music%20Festival">Woodstock Music Festival</a> in 1969 during <a href="Arlo%20Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>'s performance.

Collins decided to record it in the late 1960s amid an atmosphere of counterculture introspection; she was part of an <a href="encounter%20group">encounter group</a> that ended a contentious meeting by singing "Amazing Grace" as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album "<a href="Whales%20%26amp%3B%20Nightingales">Whales & Nightingales</a>". Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to "pull her through" to recovery. It was recorded in <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Chapel%20%28Columbia%20University%29">St. Paul's</a>, the chapel at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an "a cappella" arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, to which she objected: "I didn't know what else to do about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought ... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.

Although Collins used it as a catharsis for her opposition to the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Dragoon%20Guards">Royal Scots Dragoon Guards</a>, senior <a href="Scottish%20regiment">Scottish regiment</a> of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, recorded an instrumental version featuring a <a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> soloist accompanied by a <a href="pipe%20and%20drum">pipe and drum</a> band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the "<a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">RPM</a>" national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The <a href="Pipe%20Major">Pipe Major</a> of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to <a href="Edinburgh%20Castle">Edinburgh Castle</a> and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.

<a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a> and <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> also recorded "Amazing Grace" around the same time, and both of their renditions were popular. All four versions were marketed to distinct types of audiences thereby assuring its place as a pop song. <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> recorded it on his 1975 album "<a href="Sings%20Precious%20Memories">Sings Precious Memories</a>", dedicating it to his older brother Jack, who had been killed in a mill accident when they were boys in <a href="Dyess%2C%20Arkansas">Dyess, Arkansas</a>. Cash and his family sang it to themselves while they worked in the cotton fields following Jack's death. Cash often included the song when he toured prisons, saying "For the three minutes that song is going on, everybody is free. It just frees the spirit and frees the person."

The <a href="U.S.%20Library%20of%20Congress">U.S. Library of Congress</a> has a collection of 3,000 versions of and songs inspired by "Amazing Grace", some of which were first-time recordings by folklorists <a href="Alan%20Lomax">Alan and John Lomax</a>, a father and son team who in 1932 traveled thousands of miles across the South to capture the different regional styles of the song. More contemporary renditions include samples from such popular artists as <a href="Sam%20Cooke">Sam Cooke</a> and <a href="the%20Soul%20Stirrers">the Soul Stirrers</a> (1963), <a href="the%20Byrds">the Byrds</a> (1970), <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> (1971), <a href="Skeeter%20Davis">Skeeter Davis</a> (1972), <a href="Mighty%20Clouds%20of%20Joy">Mighty Clouds of Joy</a> (1972), <a href="Amazing%20Rhythm%20Aces">Amazing Rhythm Aces</a> (1975), <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> (1976), and <a href="the%20Lemonheads">the Lemonheads</a> (1992).

Following the appropriation of the hymn in secular music, "Amazing Grace" became such an icon in American culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns, placing it in danger of becoming a <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>. It has been mass-produced on souvenirs, lent its name to a <a href="Amazing%20Grace%20%28comics%29">Superman villain</a>, appeared on "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named <a href="Sideshow%20Bob">Sideshow Bob</a>, incorporated into <a href="International%20Society%20for%20Krishna%20Consciousness">Hare Krishna</a> chants and adapted for <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a> ceremonies. It can also be sung to the theme from "<a href="The%20Mickey%20Mouse%20Club">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>", as <a href="Garrison%20Keillor">Garrison Keillor</a> has observed. The hymn has been employed in several films, including "<a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20%28film%29">Alice's Restaurant</a>", "<a href="Coal%20Miner%27s%20Daughter%20%28film%29">Coal Miner's Daughter</a>", and "<a href="Silkwood">Silkwood</a>". It is referenced in the 2006 film "<a href="Amazing%20Grace%20%282006%20film%29">Amazing Grace</a>", which highlights Newton's influence on the leading British abolitionist <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, and in the upcoming film biography of Newton, <a href="Newton%27s%20Grace%20%28film%29">"Newton's Grace"</a>. The 1982 science fiction film "" used "Amazing Grace" amid a context of Christian symbolism, to memorialize <a href="Spock">Mr. Spock</a> following his death, but more practically, because the song has become "instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral" according to a "Star Trek" scholar. Since 1954, when an organ instrumental of "New Britain" became a bestseller, "Amazing Grace" has been associated with funerals and memorial services. It has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy, becoming a sort of "spiritual national anthem" according to authors Mary Rourke and Emily Gwathmey. For example, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> recited and then sang the hymn at the memorial service for <a href="Clementa%20C.%20Pinckney">Clementa Pinckney</a>, one of the victims of the <a href="Charleston%20church%20shooting">2015 Charleston church shooting</a>.

In recent years, the words of the hymn have been changed in some religious publications to downplay a sense of imposed self-loathing by its singers. The second line, "That saved a wretch like me!" has been rewritten as "That saved and strengthened me", "save a soul like me", or "that saved and set me free". <a href="Kathleen%20Norris%20%28poet%29">Kathleen Norris</a> in her book "Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith" characterizes this transformation of the original words as "wretched English" making the line that replaces the original "laughably bland". Part of the reason for this change has been the altered interpretations of what wretchedness and grace means. Newton's <a href="Calvinism">Calvinistic</a> view of <a href="Redemption%20%28theology%29">redemption</a> and <a href="Grace%20%28Christianity%29">divine grace</a> formed his perspective that he considered himself a sinner so vile that he was <a href="Total%20depravity">unable to change his life</a> or be redeemed without God's help. Yet his lyrical subtlety, in Steve Turner's opinion, leaves the hymn's meaning open to a variety of Christian and non-Christian interpretations. "Wretch" also represents a period in Newton's life when he saw himself outcast and miserable, as he was when he was enslaved in Sierra Leone; his own arrogance was matched by how far he had fallen in his life.

The communal understanding of redemption and human self-worth has changed since Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome in order to achieve a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, "grace" and the meaning behind the words of "Amazing Grace" have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of "Amazing Grace" is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins "When we've been there ten thousand years"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. "Grace", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as he used the word to represent God or the <a href="Grace%20%28Christianity%29">power of God</a>.

The transformative power of the song was investigated by journalist <a href="Bill%20Moyers">Bill Moyers</a> in a documentary released in 1990. Moyers was inspired to focus on the song's power after watching a performance at <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a>, where the audience consisted of Christians and non-Christians, and he noticed that it had an equal impact on everybody in attendance, unifying them. James Basker also acknowledged this force when he explained why he chose "Amazing Grace" to represent a collection of anti-slavery poetry: "there is a transformative power that is applicable ... : the transformation of sin and sorrow into grace, of suffering into beauty, of alienation into empathy and connection, of the unspeakable into imaginative literature."

Moyers interviewed Collins, Cash, opera singer <a href="Jessye%20Norman">Jessye Norman</a>, Appalachian folk musician <a href="Jean%20Ritchie">Jean Ritchie</a> and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the <a href="Huntsville%20Unit">Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville</a>. Collins, Cash, and Norman were unable to discern if the power of the song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it at the end of a large outdoor <a href="Nelson%20Mandela%2070th%20Birthday%20Tribute">rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday</a>, stated, "I don't know whether it's the text I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it's that tune that everybody knows." A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: "'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved" by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer <a href="Marion%20Williams">Marion Williams</a> summed up its effect: "That's a song that gets to everybody".

The "Dictionary of American Hymnology" claims it is included in more than a thousand published hymnals, and recommends its use for "occasions of worship when we need to confess with joy that we are saved by God's grace alone; as a hymn of response to forgiveness of sin or as an assurance of pardon; as a confession of faith or after the sermon".

AOL (formerly a company known as AOL Inc., originally known as America Online, and stylized as Aol) is a <a href="web%20portal">web portal</a> and <a href="online%20service%20provider">online service provider</a> based in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. It is a <a href="brand">brand</a> marketed by <a href="Oath%20Inc.">Oath</a>, a <a href="subsidiary">subsidiary</a> of <a href="Verizon%20Communications">Verizon Communications</a>. AOL was one of the early pioneers of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> in the mid-1990s, and the most recognized brand on the web in the U.S. It originally <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">provided a dial-up service</a> to millions of Americans, as well as providing a <a href="web%20portal">web portal</a>, <a href="e-mail">e-mail</a>, <a href="instant%20messaging">instant messaging</a> and later a <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a> following its purchase of <a href="Netscape">Netscape</a>. At the height of its popularity, it purchased the media conglomerate <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> in the largest merger in U.S. history. AOL rapidly declined thereafter, partly due to the decline of dial-up to <a href="broadband">broadband</a>. AOL was eventually <a href="Spin-off%20%28corporate%29">spun off</a> from Time Warner in 2009, with <a href="Tim%20Armstrong%20%28executive%29">Tim Armstrong</a> appointed the new CEO. Under his leadership, the company invested in media brands and advertising technologies.

On June 23, 2015, AOL was acquired by <a href="Verizon%20Communications">Verizon Communications</a> for $4.4 billion. In the following months, AOL also made a deal with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and acquired several tech properties, including <a href="Millennial%20Media">Millennial Media</a> and Kanvas to bolster their mobile ad-tech capabilities.

AOL began in 1983, as a short-lived venture called Control Video Corporation (or CVC), founded by <a href="Bill%20von%20Meister">Bill von Meister</a>. Its sole product was an online service called <a href="GameLine">GameLine</a> for the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>, after von Meister's idea of buying music on demand was rejected by <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> Subscribers bought a <a href="modem">modem</a> from the company for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>49.95 and paid a one-time US$15 setup fee. GameLine permitted subscribers to temporarily download games and keep track of high scores, at a cost of US$1 per game. The telephone disconnected and the downloaded game would remain in GameLine's Master Module and playable until the user turned off the console or downloaded another game.

In January 1983, <a href="Steve%20Case">Steve Case</a> was hired as a marketing consultant for Control Video on the recommendation of his brother, investment banker Dan Case. In May 1983, <a href="Jim%20Kimsey">Jim Kimsey</a> became a manufacturing consultant for Control Video, which was near bankruptcy. Kimsey was brought in by his West Point friend <a href="Frank%20Caufield">Frank Caufield</a>, an investor in the company. In early 1985, von Meister left the company.

On May 24, 1985, Quantum Computer Services, an online services company, was founded by Jim Kimsey from the remnants of Control Video, with Kimsey as <a href="Chief%20Executive%20Officer">Chief Executive Officer</a>, and <a href="Marc%20Seriff">Marc Seriff</a> as <a href="Chief%20Technology%20Officer">Chief Technology Officer</a>. The technical team consisted of <a href="Marc%20Seriff">Marc Seriff</a>, Tom Ralston, Ray Heinrich, Steve Trus, Ken Huntsman, Janet Hunter, Dave Brown, Craig Dykstra, Doug Coward, and Mike Ficco. In 1987, Case was promoted again to executive vice-president. Kimsey soon began to groom Case to take over the role of CEO, which he did when Kimsey retired in 1991.

Kimsey changed the company's strategy, and in 1985, launched a dedicated online service for <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="Commodore%20128">128</a> computers, originally called <a href="Quantum%20Link">Quantum Link</a> ("Q-Link" for short). The Quantum Link software was based on software licensed from <a href="PlayNET">PlayNet, Inc</a>, (founded in 1983 by Howard Goldberg and Dave Panzl). The service was different from other online services as it used the computing power of the Commodore 64 and the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> rather than just a "dumb" terminal. It passed tokens back and forth and provided a fixed price service tailored for home users. In May 1988, Quantum and <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple</a> launched <a href="AppleLink">AppleLink</a> Personal Edition for <a href="Apple%20II%20family">Apple II</a> and <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers. In August 1988, Quantum launched PC Link, a service for <a href="IBM">IBM</a>-compatible <a href="personal%20computer">PCs</a> developed in a joint venture with the <a href="Tandy%20Corporation">Tandy Corporation</a>. After the company parted ways with Apple in October 1989, Quantum changed the service's name to America Online. Case was promoted to and sold AOL as the online service for people unfamiliar with computers, in contrast to <a href="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>, which was well established in the technical community.

From the beginning, AOL included <a href="online%20game">online game</a>s in its mix of products; many classic and casual games were included in the original PlayNet software system. In the early years of AOL the company introduced many innovative online interactive titles and games, including:

In February 1991, AOL for <a href="DOS">DOS</a> was launched using a <a href="GeoWorks">GeoWorks</a> interface followed a year later by AOL for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>. This coincided with growth in pay-based online services, like <a href="Prodigy%20%28ISP%29">Prodigy</a>, <a href="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>, and <a href="GEnie">GEnie</a>. 1991 also saw the introduction of an original <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a> title called "<a href="Neverwinter%20Nights%20%28AOL%20game%29">Neverwinter Nights</a>" from <a href="Stormfront%20Studios">Stormfront Studios</a>; which was one of the first Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games to depict the adventure with graphics instead of text.

During the early 1990s, the average subscription lasted for about 25 months and accounted for $350 in total revenue. AOL discontinued <a href="Quantum%20Link">Q-Link</a> and PC Link in late 1994. In September 1993, AOL added <a href="USENET">USENET</a> access to its features. This is commonly referred to as the "<a href="Eternal%20September">Eternal September</a>", as USENET's cycle of new users was previously dominated by smaller numbers of college and university freshmen gaining access in September and taking a few weeks to acclimate. This also coincided with a new "<a href="carpet%20bombing">carpet bombing</a>" marketing campaign by CMO <a href="Jan%20Brandt">Jan Brandt</a> to distribute as many free trial AOL trial disks as possible through nonconventional distribution partners. At one point, 50% of the <a href="CD">CD</a>s produced worldwide had an AOL logo. AOL quickly surpassed <a href="GEnie">GEnie</a>, and by the mid-1990s, it passed <a href="Prodigy%20%28ISP%29">Prodigy</a> (which for several years allowed AOL advertising) and <a href="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>.

Over the next several years, AOL launched services with the <a href="National%20Education%20Association">National Education Association</a>, the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Teachers">American Federation of Teachers</a>, "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>", the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, <a href="Pearson%20PLC">Pearson</a>, <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic</a>, <a href="Association%20for%20Supervision%20and%20Curriculum%20Development">ASCD</a>, <a href="National%20School%20Boards%20Association">NSBA</a>, NCTE, <a href="Discovery%20Communications">Discovery Networks</a>, <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner</a> Education Services (<a href="CNN%20Newsroom">CNN Newsroom</a>), <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, <a href="The%20Princeton%20Review">The Princeton Review</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Kaplan">Stanley Kaplan</a>, <a href="Barron%27s%20Educational%20Series">Barron's</a>, <a href="Highlights%20for%20Kids">Highlights for Kids</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a>, and many other education providers. AOL offered the first real-time homework help service (the Teacher Pager—1990; prior to this, AOL provided homework help bulletin boards), the first service by children, for children (Kids Only Online, 1991), the first online service for parents (the Parents Information Network, 1991), the first online courses (1988), the first omnibus service for teachers (the Teachers' Information Network, 1990), the first online exhibit (<a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, 1991), the first parental controls, and many other online education firsts.
AOL charged its users an hourly fee until December 1996, when the company changed to a flat monthly rate of $19.95. During this time, AOL connections would be flooded with users trying to get on, and many canceled their accounts due to constant <a href="busy%20signal">busy signal</a>s. A commercial featuring Steve Case telling people AOL was working day and night to fix the problem was made. Within three years, AOL's user base grew to 10 million people. In 1995 AOL was headquartered at 8619 Westwood Center Drive in the <a href="Tysons%20Corner%2C%20Virginia">Tysons Corner CDP</a> in <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County</a>, Virginia, near the <a href="Vienna%2C%20Virginia">Town of Vienna</a>.

AOL was quickly running out of room in October 1996 for its network at the Fairfax County campus. In 1996, AOL moved to 22000 AOL Way in <a href="Dulles%2C%20Virginia">Dulles</a>, unincorporated <a href="Loudoun%20County%2C%20Virginia">Loudoun County, Virginia</a>. The move to Dulles took place in mid-1996 and provided room for future growth. In a five-year landmark agreement with the most popular operating system, AOL was bundled with <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> software.

On March 31, 1997, the short-lived <a href="eWorld">eWorld</a> was purchased by AOL. In 1997, about half of all U.S. homes with Internet access had it through AOL. During this time, AOL's content channels, under <a href="Jason%20Seiken">Jason Seiken</a>, including News, Sports, and Entertainment, experienced their greatest growth as AOL become the dominant online service internationally with more than 34 million subscribers. In November 1998, AOL announced it would acquire <a href="Netscape">Netscape</a>. The deal closed on March 17, 1999.

In January 2000, AOL and <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> announced plans to merge, forming AOL Time Warner, Inc. The terms of the deal called for AOL shareholders to own 55% of the new, combined company. The deal closed on January 11, 2001. The new company was led by executives from AOL, SBI, and Time Warner. <a href="Gerald%20Levin">Gerald Levin</a>, who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. <a href="Steve%20Case">Steve Case</a> served as Chairman, J. Michael Kelly (from AOL) was the Chief Financial Officer, <a href="Robert%20W.%20Pittman">Robert W. Pittman</a> (from AOL) and <a href="Richard%20Parsons%20%28businessman%29">Dick Parsons</a> (from Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers. In 2002, <a href="Jonathan%20Miller%20%28businessman%29">Jonathan Miller</a> became CEO of AOL. The following year, AOL Time Warner dropped the "AOL" from its name.

In 2004, along with the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made available the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the <a href="Live%208">Live 8</a> concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months. In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety & Security Center, a bundle of <a href="McAfee%20Antivirus">McAfee Antivirus</a>, <a href="Computer%20Associates">CA</a> anti-spyware, and proprietary <a href="Firewall%20%28computing%29">firewall</a> and <a href="Anti-phishing%20software">phishing protection</a> software. News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="Google">Google</a> as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture. Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005 that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1 billion.

On April 3, 2006, AOL announced it was retiring the full name America Online; the official name of the service became AOL, and the full name of the <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> subdivision became AOL <a href="Limited%20liability%20company">LLC</a>.
On June 8, 2006, AOL offered a new program called AOL Active Security Monitor, a diagnostic tool which checked the local PC's security status, and recommended additional security software from AOL or <a href="Download.com">Download.com</a>. The program rated the computer on a variety of different areas of security and general computer health. Two months later, AOL released <a href="AOL%20Active%20Virus%20Shield">AOL Active Virus Shield</a>. This software was developed by <a href="Kaspersky%20Lab">Kaspersky Lab</a>. Active Virus Shield software was free and did not require an AOL account, only an internet email address. The <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">ISP</a> side of <a href="AOL%20Broadband">AOL UK</a> was bought by <a href="The%20Carphone%20Warehouse">The Carphone Warehouse</a> in October 2006 to take advantage of their 100,000 <a href="Local-loop%20unbundling">LLU</a> customers, making <a href="Carphone%20Warehouse">The Carphone Warehouse</a> the biggest LLU provider in the UK.
In August 2006, AOL announced they would give away <a href="email">email</a> accounts and software previously available only to its paying customers provided the customer accessed AOL or AOL.com through a non-AOL-owned access method (otherwise known as "third party transit", "bring your own access", or "BYOA"). The move was designed to reduce costs associated with the "Walled Garden" business model by reducing usage of AOL-owned access points and shifting members with high-speed internet access from client-based usage to the more lucrative advertising provider, AOL.com. The change from paid to free was also designed to slow the rate of members canceling their accounts and defecting to <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> <a href="Hotmail">Hotmail</a>, <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>, or other free email providers. The other free services included:

Also that month, AOL informed its American customers it would be increasing the price of its <a href="dial-up%20access">dial-up access</a> to US$25.90. The increase was part of an effort to migrate the service's remaining dial-up users to broadband, as the increased price was the same price they had been charging for monthly <a href="Digital%20subscriber%20line">DSL</a> access. However, AOL has since started offering their services for $9.95 a month for unlimited dial-up access.

On November 16, 2006, <a href="Randy%20Falco">Randy Falco</a> succeeded <a href="Jonathan%20Miller%20%28businessman%29">Jonathan Miller</a> as CEO. In December 2006, AOL closed their last remaining call center in the United States, "taking the America out of America Online" according to industry pundits. Service centers based in <a href="India">India</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> continue to this day to provide customer support and technical assistance to subscribers.
On September 17, 2007, AOL announced it was moving one of its corporate headquarters from <a href="Dulles%2C%20Virginia">Dulles, Virginia</a>, to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and combining its various advertising units into a new subsidiary called Platform A. This action followed several advertising acquisitions, most notably <a href="Advertising.com">Advertising.com</a>, and highlighted the company's new focus on advertising-driven business models. AOL management stressed "significant operations" will remain in Dulles, which included the company's access services and modem banks.

In October 2007, AOL announced it would move one of its other headquarters from <a href="Loudoun%20County%2C%20Virginia">Loudoun County, Virginia</a>, to New York City; it would continue to operate its Virginia offices. As part of the impending move to New York and the restructuring of responsibilities at the Dulles headquarters complex after the Reston move, AOL CEO <a href="Randy%20Falco">Randy Falco</a> announced on October 15, 2007 plans to lay off 2,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2007, beginning "immediately". The end result was a near 40% layoff across the board at AOL. Most compensation packages associated with the October 2007 layoffs included a minimum of 120 days of severance pay, 60 of which were given in lieu of the 60-day advance notice requirement by provisions of the 1988 Federal <a href="Worker%20Adjustment%20and%20Retraining%20Notification%20Act">WARN Act</a>.

By November 2007, AOL's customer base had been reduced to 10.1 million subscribers, just narrowly ahead of <a href="Comcast">Comcast</a> and <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Yahoo%21">AT&T Yahoo!</a>. According to Falco, as of December 2007, the conversion rate of accounts from paid access to free access was over 80%.

On January 3, 2008, AOL announced the closing of one of its three Northern Virginia data centers, <a href="Reston%2C%20Virginia">Reston Technology Center</a>, and sold it to <a href="CRG%20West">CRG West</a>. On February 6, Time Warner CEO <a href="Jeffrey%20Bewkes">Jeff Bewkes</a> announced Time Warner would split AOL's internet access and advertising businesses in two, with the possibility of later selling the internet access division.

On March 13, 2008, AOL purchased the social networking site <a href="Bebo">Bebo</a> for $850m (£417m). On July 25, AOL announced it was shedding Xdrive, AOL Pictures, and BlueString to save on costs and focus on its core advertising business. AOL Pictures was terminated on December 31. On October 31, <a href="AOL%20Hometown">AOL Hometown</a> (a web hosting service for the websites of AOL customers) and the AOL Journal blog hosting service were eliminated.

On March 12, 2009, <a href="Tim%20Armstrong%20%28executive%29">Tim Armstrong</a>, formerly with <a href="Google">Google</a>, was named Chairman and CEO of AOL. Shortly thereafter, on May 28, <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> announced it would spin off AOL as an independent company once <a href="Google">Google</a>'s shares ceased at the end of the fiscal year. On November 23, AOL unveiled a sneak preview of a new brand identity which has the wordmark "Aol." superimposed onto canvases created by commissioned artists. The new identity, designed by <a href="Wolff%20Olins">Wolff Olins</a>, was enacted onto all of AOL's services on December 10, the date AOL traded independently for the first time since the Time Warner merger on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> under the symbol AOL.

On April 6, 2010, AOL announced plans to shut down or sell Bebo; on June 16, the property was sold to <a href="Criterion%20Capital%20Partners">Criterion Capital Partners</a> for an undisclosed amount, believed to be around $10 million. In December, AIM eliminated access to AOL chat rooms noting a marked decline of patronage in recent months.

Under Armstrong's leadership, AOL began taking steps in a new business direction, marked by a series of acquisitions. On June 11, 2009, AOL had already announced the acquisition of <a href="Patch%20Media">Patch Media</a>, a network of community-specific news and information sites which focuses on individual towns and communities. On September 28, 2010, at the San Francisco <a href="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> Disrupt Conference, AOL signed an agreement to acquire <a href="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> to further its overall strategy of providing premier online content. On December 12, 2010, AOL acquired <a href="about.me">about.me</a>, a personal profile and identity platform, four days after that latter's public launch.

On January 31, 2011, AOL announced the acquisition of European video distribution network, goviral. On February 7, AOL bought "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" for $315 million. Shortly after the acquisition was announced, Huffington Post co-founder <a href="Arianna%20Huffington">Arianna Huffington</a> replaced AOL Content Chief David Eun, assuming the role of President and Editor-in-Chief of the AOL Huffington Post Media Group. On March 10, AOL announced it would cut around 900 workers in the wake of the Huffington Post deal.

On September 14, 2011, AOL formed a strategic ad selling partnership with two of its largest competitors, <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. According to the new partnership, the three companies would begin selling inventory on each other's sites. The strategy was designed to help them compete with <a href="Google">Google</a> and ad networks.

On February 28, 2012, AOL partnered with <a href="PBS">PBS</a> to launch MAKERS, a digital documentary series focusing on high-achieving women in male-dominated industries such as war, comedy, space, business, Hollywood and politics. Subjects for MAKERS episodes have included <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, <a href="Sheryl%20Sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, <a href="Martha%20Stewart">Martha Stewart</a>, <a href="Indra%20Nooyi">Indra Nooyi</a>, <a href="Lena%20Dunham">Lena Dunham</a>, and <a href="Ellen%20DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a>.

On March 15, 2012, AOL announced the acquisition of Hipster, a mobile photo sharing app for an undisclosed amount. On April 9, 2012, AOL announced a deal to sell 800 patents to <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> for $1.056 billion. The deal includes a "perpetual" license for AOL to use these patents.

In April, AOL took several steps to expand its ability to generate revenue through <a href="Video%20advertising">online video advertising</a>. The company announced it would offer <a href="gross%20rating%20point">gross rating point</a> (GRP) guarantee for online video, mirroring the TV ratings system and guaranteeing audience delivery for online video advertising campaigns bought across its properties. This announcement came just days before the <a href="Digital%20Content%20NewFront">Digital Content NewFront (DCNF)</a> a two-week event held by AOL, <a href="Google">Google</a>, <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> and <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo</a> to showcase the participating sites' digital video offerings. The <a href="Digital%20Content%20NewFront">Digital Content NewFront</a> were conducted in advance of the traditional television upfronts in hopes of diverting more advertising money into the digital space. On April 24, the company launched the <a href="AOL%20On">AOL On</a> network, a single website for its video output.

In February 2013, AOL reported its fourth quarter revenue of $599.5 million, its first growth in quarterly revenue in 8 years.

In August 2013, Armstrong announced <a href="Patch%20Media">Patch Media</a> would scale back or sell hundreds of its local news sites. Not long afterwards, layoffs began, with up to 500 out of 1,100 positions initially impacted. On January 15, 2014, Patch Media was spun off, with majority ownership being held by Hale Global. By the end of 2014, AOL controlled 0.74% of the global advertising market, well behind industry leader Google's 31.4%.

On January 23, 2014, AOL acquired Gravity, a software startup that tracked users’ online behavior and tailored ads and content based on their interests, for $83 million. The deal, which included roughly 40 Gravity employees and their personalization technology, was CEO Tim Armstrong’s fourth largest deal since taking over the company in 2009. Later that year, AOL also acquired Vidible, which developed technology to help websites run video content from other publishers, and help video publishers sell their content to these websites. The deal, which was announced December 1, 2014, was reportedly worth roughly $50 million.

On July 16, 2014, AOL earned an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a> nomination for the AOL original series, The Future Starts Here, in the News and Documentary category. This came days after AOL earned its first <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> nomination for "<a href="Park%20Bench%20with%20Steve%20Buscemi">Park Bench with Steve Buscemi</a>" in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Short%20Form%20Variety%20Series">Outstanding Short Form Variety Series</a> category, which later won the award. Created and hosted by <a href="Tiffany%20Shlain">Tiffany Shlain</a>, the series focused on human's relationship with technology and featured episodes such as The Future of Our Species, Why We Love Robots, and A Case for Optimism.

On May 12, 2015, <a href="Verizon">Verizon</a> announced plans to buy AOL for $50 per share in a deal valued at $4.4 billion. The transaction was completed on June 23. <a href="Tim%20Armstrong%20%28executive%29">Armstrong</a>, who continued to lead the firm following regulatory approval, called the deal the logical next step for AOL. "If you look forward five years, you're going to be in a space where there are going to be massive, global-scale networks, and there's no better partner for us to go forward with than Verizon." he said. "It's really not about selling the company today. It's about setting up for the next five to 10 years."

Analyst David Bank said he thought the deal made sense for Verizon. The deal will broaden Verizon's advertising sales platforms and increase its video production ability through websites such as "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>", <a href="TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a>, and <a href="Engadget">Engadget</a>. However, Craig Moffett said it was unlikely the deal would make a big difference to Verizon's bottom line. AOL had about two million dial-up subscribers at the time of the buyout. The announcement caused AOL's stock price to rise 17%, while Verizon's stock price dropped slightly.

Shortly before the Verizon purchase, on April 14, 2015, AOL launched ONE by AOL, a digital marketing programmatic platform that unifies buying channels and audience management platforms to track and optimize campaigns over multiple screens. Later that year, on September 15, AOL expanded the product with ONE by AOL: Creative, which is geared towards creative and media agencies to similarly connect marketing and ad distribution efforts.

On May 8, 2015, AOL reported its first quarter revenue of $625.1 million, $483.5 million of which came from advertising and related operations, marking a 7% increase from Q1 2014. Over that year, the AOL Platforms division saw a 21% increase in revenue, but a drop in adjusted OIBDA due to increased investments in the company’s video and programmatic platforms.

On June 29, 2015, AOL announced a deal with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to take over the majority of its digital advertising business. Under the pact, as many as 1,200 Microsoft employees involved with the business will be transferred to AOL, and the company will take over the sale of display, video, and mobile ads on various Microsoft platforms in nine countries, including Brazil, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, <a href="Google%20Search">Google Search</a> will be replaced on AOL properties with <a href="Bing%20%28search%20engine%29">Bing</a>—which will display advertising <a href="Bing%20Ads">sold by Microsoft</a>. Both advertising deals are subject to <a href="affiliate%20marketing">affiliate marketing</a> <a href="revenue%20sharing">revenue sharing</a>.
On July 22, 2015, AOL received two News and Documentary Emmy nominations, one for MAKERS in the Outstanding Historical Programming category, and the other for True Trans With <a href="Laura%20Jane%20Grace">Laura Jane Grace</a>, which documented the story of Laura Jane Grace, a <a href="transgender">transgender</a> musician best known as the founder, lead singer, songwriter and guitarist of the punk rock band <a href="Against%20Me%21">Against Me!</a>, and her decision to come out publicly and overall transition experience.

On September 3, 2015, AOL agreed to buy <a href="Millennial%20Media">Millennial Media</a> for US $238 million . On October 23, 2015, AOL completed the acquisition.

On October 1, 2015, Go90, a free ad-supported mobile video service aimed at young adult and teen viewers that Verizon owns and AOL oversees and operates launched its content publicly after months of beta testing. The initial launch line-up included content from <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>, <a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">Huffington Post</a>, <a href="Nerdist%20News">Nerdist News</a>, <a href="Univision">Univision</a> News, <a href="Vice%20Media">Vice</a>, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> and <a href="MTV">MTV</a>.

On January 25, 2016, AOL expanded its ONE platform by introducing ONE by AOL: Publishers, which combines six previously separate technologies to offer various publisher capabilities such as customizing video players, offering premium ad experience to boost visibility, and generating large video libraries. The announcement was made in tandem with AOL’s acquisition of AlephD, a Paris-based startup focused on publisher analytics of ad price tracking based on historical data. AOL announced AlephD would be a part of the ONE by AOL: Publishers platform.

On April 20, 2016, AOL acquired virtual reality studio <a href="RYOT">RYOT</a> to bring immersive 360 degree video and VR content to The Huffington Post’s global audience across desktop, mobile, and apps.

In July 2016, Verizon Communications announced its intent to purchase the core internet business of <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>. Verizon tentatively plans to merge AOL with Yahoo into a new company called "<a href="Oath%20Inc.">Oath</a>".

AOL Desktop is an internet suite produced by AOL that integrates a <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a>, a <a href="Media%20player%20%28application%20software%29">media player</a> and an <a href="instant%20messenger">instant messenger</a> client. Version 10.X was based on <a href="AOL%20OpenRide">AOL OpenRide</a>, it is an upgrade from such. The <a href="macOS">macOS</a> version is based on <a href="WebKit">WebKit</a>.

AOL Desktop version 10.X was different from previous <a href="AOL%20Explorer">AOL browsers</a> and AOL Desktop versions. Its features are focused on web browsing as well as <a href="email">email</a>. For instance, one does not have to sign into AOL in order to use it as a regular browser. In addition, non-AOL email accounts can be accessed through it. There are several predominate buttons: "MAIL", "IM", and several shortcuts to various Web Pages. The first two require users to sign in but the shortcuts to web pages can be used without authentication. AOL Desktop version 10.X was late marked as unsupported in favor of supporting the AOL Desktop 9.X versions.

Version 9.8 was released, replacing the Internet Explorer components of the internet browser with <a href="Chromium%20Embedded%20Framework">CEF</a> (Chromium Embedded Framework) to give users an improved web browsing experience closer to that of <a href="Google%20Chrome">Chrome</a>

Version 11 of AOL Desktop, currently in Beta, is a total rewrite but maintains a similar user interface to the previous 9.8.X series of releases.

Since spinning off from <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> in 2010, AOL has made corporate social responsibility an important part of its mission. In its company values, AOL states, "We are in the business of helping people, period." For the company's corporate social responsibility efforts, AOL's CEO <a href="Tim%20Armstrong%20%28executive%29">Tim Armstrong</a> was included in a July 9, 2012 <a href="Adweek">Adweek</a> article, "The Givers," highlighting individuals who have committed their and their companies' time, money and resources to a diverse range of causes.

Each year on the company's birthday, AOL employees around the world are invited to participate in Monster Help Day, a global community service day dedicated to strengthening the communities in which AOL employees live and work. Other corporate social responsibility initiatives include producing cause-related content for AOL properties; donating <a href="Public%20service%20announcement">PSA</a> campaigns throughout the AOL network; empowering consumers through cause-related contests and initiatives; implementing a permanent cause module on AOL's homepage, dedicated to promoting nonprofit organizations.

AOL Charitable Foundation is a private 501c3 foundation funded by AOL Inc.

In its earlier incarnation as a "<a href="Closed%20platform">walled garden</a>" community and service provider, AOL received criticism for its community policies, terms of service, and customer service. Prior to 2006, AOL was known for its direct mailing of CD-ROMs and 3½" floppy disks containing its software. The disks were distributed in large numbers; at one point, half of the CDs manufactured worldwide had AOL logos on them. The marketing tactic was criticized for its environmental cost, and AOL CDs were recognized as <a href="PC%20World">PCWorld</a>'s most annoying tech product.

Prior to mid-2005, AOL used <a href="virtual%20volunteering">online volunteers</a> called <a href="AOL%20Community%20Leader%20Program">Community Leaders</a>, or CLs, to monitor chatrooms, message boards, and libraries. AOL's use of <a href="virtual%20volunteering">remote volunteers</a> dated back to the establishment of its <a href="Quantum%20Link">Quantum Link</a> service in 1985. Most content maintenance was performed by partner and internal employees. Community leaders were recruited for some content design and maintenance, for which they used a proprietary language and interface called RAINMAN. Other community leaders hosted chat rooms and provided online help. During the time that AOL customers paid by the hour, chat room hosts were compensated in free online time for each hour they worked, though of course any banked hours became worthless once fixed-rate payment was introduced.

Two former community leaders, Brian Williams of Dallas and Kelly Hallissey of New York filed a class action lawsuit against AOL, citing violations of <a href="United%20States%20labor%20law">U.S. labor laws</a> in its use of community leaders. The lawsuit was filed in the United States Federal Courthouse, New York City on May 25, 1999, and was followed shortly by the dismissal of all community leaders under the age of 18 years, as well as a reorganization of the community leader program as a whole. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Department of Labor</a> was also investigating AOL's alleged labor law violations, but came to no conclusion, closing their investigation in 2001. AOL began drastically reducing the responsibilities and privileges of its volunteers in 2000. The program was eventually ended on June 8, 2005. Current Community Leaders at the time were offered 12 months of credit on their accounts in thanks for their service.

Within one decade of the class action lawsuit being filed, the class had grown to over 6,000 members, comprising the largest class action lawsuit ever filed against an internet based company. Currently it is the third largest class ever involved in any lawsuit on a federal level in the United States, affecting ultimately the employment eligibility of individuals in an online environment.

In February 2010, a settlement was approved by the Courts in the class action suit. The settlement included a $15 million USD payment. This payment was then divided into thirds, the first of which was attorney and legal fees. Five million was then divided among the included members of the class which consisted of more than 7,000 individual former Community Leaders. The final five million dollars was donated to charities hand picked by Hallissey and Williams, and then approved by the Courts for distribution. One such charity, the Remote Area Medical Foundation (www.ramusa.org), received payments in excess of $1.2 million USD for the provision of medical services, supplies and medication for those in need within the more rural areas of the United States and beyond.

Prior to the 1999 class action lawsuit, the community leaders were informed of a change in compensation for duties performed by AOL. Community leaders would be charged a reduced rate per month for their accounts, and would no longer be given unlimited access without invoice. During this live announcement via an online meeting of all community leaders in a virtual arena, Brian Williams of Dallas led many community leaders in a virtual "strike" or "sit-in" to protest the new charges the community leaders were now being asked to pay. This protest or strike is noted as the first of its kind for an online environment and was nicknamed for the row of the arena it was held in: Row 800. Following the protest, AOL terminated the online working relationship between itself and several of the Community Leaders involved. Quickly following the release of these community leaders, each was reinstated, with the exception of Williams, due to his role in the protest. During this time, Williams' role on AOL was that of Guide XNT (Guide Program), CB Naked (Crystal Ball forum), VnV Naked (iVillage's Vices and Virtues Forum) and JCommBrian (Jewish Community Online Forum).

AOL has faced a number of lawsuits over claims that it has been slow to stop billing customers after their accounts have been canceled, either by the company or the user. In addition, AOL changed its method of calculating used minutes in response to a class action lawsuit. Previously, AOL would add 15 seconds to the time a user was connected to the service and round up to the next whole minute (thus, a person who used the service for 12 minutes and 46 seconds would be charged for 14 minutes). AOL claimed this was to account for sign on/sign off time, but because this practice was not made known to its customers, the plaintiffs won (some also pointed out that signing on and off did not always take 15 seconds, especially when connecting via another ISP). AOL disclosed its connection-time calculation methods to all of its customers and credited them with extra free hours. In addition, the AOL software would notify the user of exactly how long they were connected and how many minutes they were being charged.

AOL was sued by the <a href="Ohio%20Attorney%20General">Ohio Attorney General</a> in October 2003 for improper billing practices. The case was settled on June 8, 2005. AOL agreed to resolve any consumer <a href="Consumer%20complaint">complaints</a> filed with the <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> AG's office. In December 2006, AOL agreed to provide <a href="restitution">restitution</a> to Florida consumers to settle the case filed against them by the <a href="Florida%20Attorney%20General">Florida Attorney General</a>.

Many customers complained that AOL personnel ignored their demands to cancel service and stop billing. In response to approximately 300 consumer complaints, the <a href="New%20York%20Attorney%20General">New York Attorney General</a>'s office began an inquiry of AOL's customer service policies. The investigation revealed that the company had an elaborate scheme for rewarding employees who purported to <a href="Customer%20retention">retain</a> or "save" subscribers who had called to cancel their Internet service. In many instances, such retention was done against subscribers' wishes, or without their consent. Under the scheme, customer service personnel received bonuses worth tens of thousands of dollars if they could successfully dissuade or "save" half of the people who called to cancel service. For several years, AOL had instituted minimum retention or "save" percentages, which consumer representatives were expected to meet. These bonuses, and the minimum "save" rates accompanying them, had the effect of employees not honoring cancellations, or otherwise making cancellation unduly difficult for consumers.

On August 24, 2005, America Online agreed to pay $1.25 million to the state of New York and reformed its customer service procedures. Under the agreement, AOL would no longer require its customer service representatives to meet a minimum quota for customer retention in order to receive a bonus. However the agreement only covered people in the state of New York.

On June 13, 2006, Vincent Ferrari documented his account cancellation phone call in a blog post, stating he had switched to broadband years earlier. In the recorded phone call, the AOL representative refused to cancel the account unless the 30-year-old Ferrari explained why AOL hours were still being recorded on it. Ferrari insisted that AOL software was not even installed on the computer. When Ferrari demanded that the account be canceled regardless, the AOL representative asked to speak with Ferrari's father, for whom the account had been set up. The conversation was aired on CNBC. When CNBC reporters tried to have an account on AOL cancelled, they were hung up on immediately and it ultimately took more than 45 minutes to cancel the account.

On July 19, 2006, AOL's entire <a href="Customer%20retention">retention</a> manual was released on the Internet. On August 3, 2006, <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> announced that the company would be dissolving AOL's retention centers due to its profits hinging on $1 billion in cost cuts. The company estimated that it would lose more than six million subscribers over the following year.

Prior to 2006, AOL was infamous for the unsolicited mass <a href="direct%20mail">direct mail</a> of 3½" <a href="floppy%20disks">floppy disks</a> and <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>s containing their software. They were the most frequent user of this marketing tactic, and received criticism for the environmental cost of the campaign. According to "PC World", in the 1990s "you couldn't open a magazine ("PC World" included) or your mailbox without an AOL disk falling out of it".

The mass distribution of these disks was seen as wasteful by the public and led to protest groups. One such was No More AOL CDs, a web-based effort by two IT workers to collect one million disks with the intent to return the disks to AOL. The website was started in August 2001, and an estimated 410,176 CDs were collected by August 2007 when the project was shut down. AOL CDs were recognized as No.1 on <a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PCWorld's</a> top ten list of most annoying tech products.


When AOL gave clients access to <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> in 1993, they hid at least one newsgroup in standard list view: "alt.aol-sucks". AOL did list the newsgroup in the alternative description view, but changed the description to "Flames and complaints about America Online". With AOL clients swarming <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroups, the old, existing user base started to develop a strong distaste for both AOL and its clients, referring to the new state of affairs as <a href="Eternal%20September">Eternal September</a>.

AOL discontinued access to Usenet on June 25, 2005. No official details were provided as to the cause of decommissioning Usenet access, except providing users the suggestion to access Usenet services from a third-party, <a href="Google%20Groups">Google Groups</a>. AOL then provided community-based <a href="Internet%20Forum">message boards</a> in lieu of Usenet.

AOL has a detailed set of guidelines and expectations for users on their service, known as the <a href="Terms%20of%20Service">Terms of Service</a> (TOS, also known as Conditions of Service, or COS in the UK). It is separated into three different sections: "Member Agreement", "Community Guidelines" and "Privacy Policy". All three agreements are presented to users at time of registration and digital acceptance is achieved when they access the AOL service. During the period when volunteer chat room hosts and board monitors were used, chat room hosts were given a brief online training session and test on Terms of Service violations.

There have been many complaints over rules that govern an AOL user's conduct. Some users disagree with the TOS, citing the guidelines are too strict to follow coupled with the fact the TOS may change without users being made aware. A considerable cause for this was likely due to alleged censorship of user-generated content during the earlier years of growth for AOL.

In early 2005, AOL stated its intention to implement a <a href="certified%20email">certified email</a> system called Goodmail, which will allow companies to send email to users with whom they have pre-existing business relationships, with a visual indication that the email is from a trusted source and without the risk that the email messages might be blocked or stripped by <a href="spam%20filter">spam filter</a>s.

This decision drew fire from <a href="MoveOn">MoveOn</a>, which characterized the program as an "email tax", and the <a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation">EFF</a>, which characterized it as a shakedown of non-profits. A website called Dearaol.com was launched, with an online petition and a blog that garnered hundreds of signatures from people and organizations expressing their opposition to AOL's use of Goodmail.

<a href="Esther%20Dyson">Esther Dyson</a> defended the move in a "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" editorial saying "I hope Goodmail succeeds, and that it has lots of competition. I also think it and its competitors will eventually transform into services that more directly serve the interests of mail recipients. Instead of the fees going to Goodmail and EON, they will also be shared with the individual recipients."

Tim Lee of the Technology Liberation Front posted an article that questioned the EFF's adopting a confrontational posture when dealing with private companies. Lee's article cited a series of discussions on <a href="Declan%20McCullagh">Declan McCullagh</a>'s Politechbot mailing list on this subject between the EFF's Danny O'Brien and antispammer Suresh Ramasubramanian, who has also compared the EFF's tactics in opposing Goodmail to tactics used by Republican political strategist <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a>. <a href="Spamassassin">Spamassassin</a> developer Justin Mason posted some criticism of the EFF's and Moveon's "going overboard" in their opposition to the scheme.

The dearaol.com campaign lost momentum and disappeared, with the last post to the now defunct dearaol.com blog—"AOL starts the shakedown" being made on May 9, 2006.

<a href="Comcast">Comcast</a>, who also used the service, announced on its website that Goodmail had ceased operations and as of February 4, 2011 they no longer used the service.

On August 4, 2006, AOL released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing 20 million search <a href="Index%20term">keywords</a> for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period between March 1, 2006 and May 31, intended for research purposes. AOL pulled the file from public access by August 7, but not before its wide distribution on the Internet by others. Derivative research, titled "A Picture of Search" was published by authors Pass, Chowdhury and Torgeson for The First International Conference on Scalable Information Systems.

The data were used by websites such as AOLstalker for entertainment purposes, where users of AOLstalker are encouraged to judge AOL clients based on the humorousness of personal details revealed by search behavior.

In 2003, Jason Smathers, an AOL employee, was convicted of stealing America Online's 92 million screen names and selling them to a known spammer. Smathers pled guilty to conspiracy charges in 2005. Smathers pled guilty to violations of the US <a href="CAN-SPAM%20Act%20of%202003">CAN-SPAM Act of 2003</a>. He was sentenced in August 2005 to 15 months in prison; the sentencing judge also recommended Smathers be forced to pay $84,000 in restitution, triple the $28,000 that he sold the addresses for.

On February 27, 2012 a <a href="class%20action%20lawsuit">class action lawsuit</a> was filed against <a href="Support.com">Support.com</a>, Inc. and partner <a href="AOL%2C%20Inc.">AOL, Inc.</a> The lawsuit alleged Support.com and AOL's Computer Checkup "<a href="scareware">scareware</a>" (which uses software developed by Support.com) misrepresented that their software programs would identify and resolve a host of technical problems with computers, offered to perform a free “scan,” which often found problems with users' computers. The companies then offered to sell software—for which AOL allegedly charged $4.99 a month and Support.com $29—to remedy those problems. Both AOL, Inc. and Support.com, Inc. settled on May 30, 2013 for $8.5 million. This included $25.00 to each valid class member and $100,000 each to <a href="Consumer%20Watchdog">Consumer Watchdog</a> and the <a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. Judge Corley wrote: “Distributing a portion of the [funds] to Consumer Watchdog will meet the interests of the silent class members because the organization will use the funds to help protect consumers across the nation from being subject to the types of fraudulent and misleading conduct that is alleged here,” and “EFF’s mission includes a strong consumer protection component, especially in regards to online protection.”

AOL continues to market "Computer Checkup". It is not clear if this latest "Computer Checkup" continues to use <a href="scareware">scareware</a> techniques.

Following media reports about <a href="PRISM%20%28surveillance%20program%29">PRISM</a>, NSA's massive electronic <a href="Mass%20surveillance">surveillance program</a>, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including AOL. According to leaks of said program, AOL joined the PRISM program in 2011.

At one time, most AOL users had an online "profile" hosted by the <a href="AOL%20Hometown">AOL Hometown</a> service. When AOL Hometown was discontinued, users had to create a new profile on <a href="Bebo">Bebo</a>. This was an unsuccessful attempt to create a social network that would compete with Facebook. When the value of Bebo decreased to a tiny fraction of the $850 million AOL paid for it, users were forced to recreate their profiles yet again, on a new service called <a href="AOL%20Lifestream">AOL Lifestream</a>. 

AOL took the decision to shut down Lifestream on 24 February 2017, and gave users one month's notice to save off photos and videos that had been uploaded to Lifestream. Following the shutdown, AOL no longer provides any option for hosting user profiles.

During the Hometown/Bebo/Lifestream era, another user's profile could be displayed by clicking the "Buddy Info" button in the AOL Desktop software. After the shutdown of Lifestream, clicking "Buddy Info" does something that provides no information whatsoever about the selected buddy: it causes the <a href="AOL%20Instant%20Messenger">AIM</a> home page (www.aim.com) to be displayed.

Anno Domini

The terms (AD) and before Christ (BC) are used to label or number years in the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian</a> and <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>s. The term "" is <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> and means "in the year of the Lord", but is often translated as "in the year of our Lord".

This <a href="calendar%20era">calendar era</a> is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the <a href="annunciation">conception</a> or <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">birth</a> of <a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, with "AD" counting years from the start of this <a href="epoch%20%28reference%20date%29">epoch</a>, and "BC" denoting years before the start of the era. There is no <a href="year%20zero">year zero</a> in this scheme, so the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1 BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by <a href="Dionysius%20Exiguus">Dionysius Exiguus</a> of <a href="Scythia%20Minor">Scythia Minor</a>, but was not widely used until after 800.

The Gregorian calendar is the most widely used calendar in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>.

Traditionally, <a href="English%20language">English</a> followed <a href="Latin">Latin</a> usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number. However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD 2018, but 68 BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a <a href="century">century</a> or <a href="millennium">millennium</a>, as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions). Because BC is the English abbreviation for "Before Christ", it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means "After Death", i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would not be included in either of the BC and the AD time scales.

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or <a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a> (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). <a href="Astronomical%20year%20numbering">Astronomical year numbering</a> and <a href="ISO%208601">ISO 8601</a> avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

The "Anno Domini" dating system was devised in 525 by <a href="Dionysius%20Exiguus">Dionysius Exiguus</a> to enumerate the years in his <a href="Dionysius%20Exiguus%27%20Easter%20table">Easter table</a>. His system was to replace the <a href="Era%20of%20Martyrs">Diocletian era</a> that had been used in an old <a href="Easter%20table">Easter table</a> because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who <a href="Diocletianic%20Persecution">persecuted Christians</a>. The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a> years were identified by naming the <a href="consul">consul</a>s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of <a href="Flavius%20Anicius%20Probus%20Iunior">Probus Junior</a>", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ". Thus Dionysius implied that Jesus' Incarnation occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, <a href="Olympiad">Olympiad</a>, <a href="Anno%20Mundi">year of the world</a>, or <a href="regnal%20year">regnal year</a> of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."

<a href="Bonnie%20J.%20Blackburn">Bonnie J. Blackburn</a> and <a href="Leofranc%20Holford-Strevens">Leofranc Holford-Strevens</a> briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Nativity</a> or <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">Incarnation</a>. Among the sources of confusion are:

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table. It is convenient to initiate a calendar not from the very day of an event but from the beginning of a cycle which occurs in close proximity. For example, the Islamic calendar begins not from the date of the <a href="Hegira">Hegira</a>, but rather weeks later, on the first subsequent occurrence of the month of Muharram (corresponding to 16 July 622).

It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent <a href="End%20of%20the%20world%20%28religion%29">end of the world</a>. At the time, it was believed by some that the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">Resurrection</a> and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old "<a href="Anno%20Mundi">Anno Mundi</a>" calendar theoretically commenced with the <a href="Dating%20creation">creation of the world</a> based on information in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. It was believed that, based on the "Anno Mundi" calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the "Anno Mundi" calendar marking the end of the world. "Anno Mundi" 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.

The <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> historian the <a href="Venerable%20Bede">Venerable Bede</a>, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used "Anno Domini" dating in his "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another <a href="Latin">Latin</a> term, "ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo" ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era. Both Dionysius and Bede regarded "Anno Domini" as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" ("Annunciation style").
On the continent of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, "Anno Domini" was introduced as the era of choice of the <a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a> by the English cleric and scholar <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Frankish%20Kings">his successors</a> popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a> ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the <a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>, <a href="pope">pope</a>s continued to date documents according to <a href="regnal%20years">regnal years</a> for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries. In 1422, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> became the last <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>an country to <a href="Spanish%20era">switch to</a> the system begun by Dionysius. <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> countries only began to adopt AD instead of the <a href="Byzantine%20calendar">Byzantine calendar</a> in 1700 when <a href="Russia">Russia</a> did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although "Anno Domini" was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede the Venerable used the expression ""anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"" (so in the year before the Incarnation of the Lord) twice. ""Anno an xpi nativitate"" (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk. In 1627, the French <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> <a href="theologian">theologian</a> <a href="Denis%20P%C3%A9tau">Denis Pétau</a> (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work "De doctrina temporum", popularized the usage "ante Christum" (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.

When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, or <a href="Easter">Easter</a>. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC. The historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating, but the date is estimated through two different approaches - one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the <a href="ministry%20of%20Jesus">ministry of Jesus</a>.

During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20consuls">consular dating</a>, imperial <a href="regnal%20year">regnal year</a> dating, and <a href="Anno%20Mundi">Creation dating</a>.

Although the last non-imperial consul, <a href="Anicius%20Faustus%20Albinus%20Basilius">Basilius</a>, was appointed in 541 by Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>, later emperors through <a href="Constans%20II">Constans II</a> (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years. Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of <a href="Leo%20VI%20the%20Wise">Leo VI</a> did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>n monk <a href="Annianus%20of%20Alexandria">Annianus</a> around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, years numbered from it, an "Era of Incarnation", were exclusively used and are yet used, in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian</a> and <a href="Ethiopian%20calendar">Ethiopian calendar</a>s. Byzantine chroniclers like <a href="Maximus%20the%20Confessor">Maximus the Confessor</a>, <a href="George%20Syncellus">George Syncellus</a>, and <a href="Theophanes%20the%20Confessor">Theophanes</a> dated their years from Annianus' <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">creation</a> of the world. This era, called "<a href="Anno%20Mundi">Anno Mundi</a>", "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used "Anno Mundi" years from 1 September 5509 BC, the <a href="Byzantine%20calendar">Byzantine Era</a>. No single "Anno Mundi" epoch was dominant throughout the <a href="Christian%20world">Christian world</a>. <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> in his "<a href="Chronicon%20%28Eusebius%29">Chronicle</a>" used an era beginning with the birth of <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the <a href="Era%20of%20the%20Caesars">Era of the Caesars</a> or <a href="Spanish%20Era">Spanish Era</a>, which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> became the last Catholic country to adopt the "Anno Domini" system.

The <a href="Era%20of%20Martyrs">Era of Martyrs</a>, which numbered years from the accession of <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> in 284, who launched the last yet most severe <a href="persecution%20of%20Christians">persecution of Christians</a>, was used by the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Church of Alexandria</a> and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and <a href="Coptic%20Catholic%20Church">Coptic Catholic</a> churches. It was also used by the <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox%20Tewahedo%20Church">Ethiopian</a> church. Another system was to date from the <a href="crucifixion">crucifixion</a> of Jesus Christ, which as early as <a href="Hippolytus%20%28writer%29">Hippolytus</a> and <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> manuscripts.

Alternative names for the "Anno Domini" era include "vulgaris aerae" (found 1615 in Latin),
"Vulgar Era" (in English, as early as 1635),
"Christian Era" (in English, in 1652),
"<a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a>" (in English, 1708),
and "Current Era".
Since 1856,
the alternative abbreviations <a href="Common%20Era">CE and BCE</a>, (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.
For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Christ</a> and hence are more appropriate for <a href="interfaith%20dialog">interfaith dialog</a> than the conventional B.C./A.D." Upon its foundation, the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> adopted the <a href="Minguo%20Era">Minguo Era</a>, but used the Western calendar for international purposes. The translated term was 西元 ("xī yuán", "Western Era"). Later, in 1949, the <a href="China">People's Republic of China</a> adopted 公元 ("gōngyuán", "Common Era") for all purposes domestic and foreign.

In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian</a> or <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them. Because of this, most experts agree that a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the much more common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the <a href="Millennium%20celebrations">worldwide celebration of the new millennium</a> took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.

For computational reasons, <a href="astronomical%20year%20numbering">astronomical year numbering</a> and the <a href="ISO%208601">ISO 8601</a> standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc. In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

Alcuin

Alcuin of York (; ; 735 – 19 May 804 AD)—also called Ealhwine, Alhwin or Alchoin—was an English scholar, clergy, poet and teacher from <a href="York">York</a>, <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. He was born around 735 and became the student of <a href="Ecgbert%20%28Archbishop%20of%20York%29">Archbishop Ecgbert</a> at York. At the invitation of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, he became a leading scholar and teacher at the <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingian court</a>, where he remained a figure in the 780s and '90s.

Alcuin wrote many theological and dogmatic treatises, as well as a few grammatical works and a number of poems. He was made Abbot of <a href="Tours">Tours</a> in 796, where he remained until his death. "The most learned man anywhere to be found", according to <a href="Einhard">Einhard</a>'s "<a href="Vita%20Karoli%20Magni">Life of Charlemagne</a>" ("ca." 817-833), he is considered among the most important architects of the <a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a>. Among his pupils were many of the dominant intellectuals of the Carolingian era.

Alcuin was born in <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, presumably sometime in the 730s. Virtually nothing is known of his parents, family background, or origin. In common hagiographical fashion, the "Vita Alcuini" asserts that Alcuin was 'of noble English stock,' and this statement has usually been accepted by scholars. Alcuin's own work only mentions such collateral kinsmen as Wilgils, father of the missionary saint <a href="Willibrord">Willibrord</a>; and Beornred, abbot of Echternach and bishop of Sens, who was more distantly related.

In his "Life" of St Willibrord, Alcuin writes that Wilgils, called a "paterfamilias", had founded an oratory and church at the mouth of the <a href="Humber">Humber</a>, which had fallen into Alcuin's possession by inheritance. Because in early Anglo-Latin writing "paterfamilias" ("head of a family, householder") usually referred to a <a href="churl">ceorl</a>, <a href="Donald%20A.%20Bullough">Donald A. Bullough</a> suggests that Alcuin's family was of <a href="churl">cierlisc</a> status: "i.e.," free but subordinate to a noble lord, and that Alcuin and other members of his family rose to prominence through beneficial connections with the aristocracy. If so, Alcuin's origins may lie in the southern part of what was formerly known as <a href="Deira">Deira</a>.

The young Alcuin came to the <a href="cathedral%20church">cathedral church</a> of <a href="York">York</a> during the golden age of Archbishop <a href="Ecgbert%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Ecgbert</a> and his brother, the Northumbrian King <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Northumbria">Eadberht</a>. Ecgbert had been a disciple of the <a href="Bede">Venerable Bede</a>, who urged him to raise York to an <a href="archbishopric">archbishopric</a>. King Eadberht and Archbishop Ecgbert oversaw the re-energising and re-organisation of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">English church</a>, with an emphasis on reforming the clergy and on the tradition of learning that Bede had begun. Ecgbert was devoted to Alcuin, who thrived under his tutelage.

The York school was renowned as a centre of learning in the liberal arts, literature, and science, as well as in religious matters. It was from here that Alcuin drew inspiration for the school he would lead at the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> court. He revived the school with the <a href="Trivium%20%28education%29">trivium</a> and <a href="quadrivium">quadrivium</a> disciplines, writing a <a href="codex">codex</a> on the trivium, while his student <a href="Rabanus%20Maurus">Hraban</a> wrote one on the quadrivium.

Alcuin graduated to become a teacher during the 750s. His ascendancy to the headship of the York school, the ancestor of <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20School%2C%20York">St Peter's School</a>, began after <a href="Ethelbert%20of%20York">Aelbert</a> became Archbishop of York in 767. Around the same time Alcuin became a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> in the church. He was never ordained a priest. Though there is no real evidence that he took monastic vows, he lived as if he had.

In 781, King <a href="%C3%86lfwald%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Elfwald</a> sent Alcuin to Rome to petition the Pope for official confirmation of York's status as an archbishopric and to confirm the election of the new archbishop, <a href="Eanbald%20I">Eanbald I</a>. On his way home he met Charlemagne (whom he had met once before), this time in the Italian city of <a href="Parma">Parma</a>.

Alcuin's intellectual curiosity allowed him to be reluctantly persuaded to join Charlemagne's court. He joined an illustrious group of scholars that Charlemagne had gathered around him, the mainsprings of the <a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a>: <a href="Peter%20of%20Pisa">Peter of Pisa</a>, <a href="Saint%20Paulinus%20II">Paulinus of Aquileia</a>, Rado, and <a href="Saint%20Fulrad">Abbot Fulrad</a>. Alcuin would later write that "the Lord was calling me to the service of King Charles."

Alcuin became Master of the <a href="Charlemagne%27s%20Palace%20in%20Aachen">Palace</a> School of Charlemagne in <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> ("Urbs Regale") in 782. It had been founded by the king's ancestors as a place for the education of the royal children (mostly in manners and the ways of the court). However, Charlemagne wanted to include the <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> and, most importantly, the study of religion. From 782 to 790, Alcuin taught Charlemagne himself, his sons <a href="Pepin%20the%20Hunchback">Pepin</a> and <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis</a>, as well as young men sent to be educated at court, and the young clerics attached to the <a href="Palatine%20Chapel%20in%20Aachen">palace chapel</a>. Bringing with him from York his assistants Pyttel, Sigewulf, and Joseph, Alcuin revolutionised the educational standards of the Palace School, introducing Charlemagne to the liberal arts and creating a personalised atmosphere of scholarship and learning, to the extent that the institution came to be known as the 'school of Master Albinus'.

In this role as adviser, he took issue with the emperor's policy of forcing pagans to be baptised on pain of death, arguing, "Faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence. You can force people to be baptised, but you cannot force them to believe." His arguments seem to have prevailed – Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.

Charlemagne gathered the best men of every land in his court, and became far more than just the king at the centre. It seems that he made many of these men his closest friends and counsellors. They referred to him as 'David', a reference to the Biblical king <a href="David%20%28biblical%20king%29">David</a>. Alcuin soon found himself on intimate terms with Charlemagne and the other men at court, where pupils and masters were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. Alcuin himself was known as 'Albinus' or 'Flaccus'. While at <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>, Alcuin bestowed pet names upon his pupils – derived mainly from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Eclogues">Eclogues</a>". According to the "Encyclopædia Britannica", "He loved Charlemagne and enjoyed the king’s esteem, but his letters reveal that his fear of him was as great as his love.

In 790 Alcuin returned from the court of Charlemagne to England, to which he had remained attached. He dwelt there for some time, but Charlemagne then invited him back to help in the fight against the <a href="Adoptionism">Adoptionist</a> heresy which was at that time making great progress in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo</a>, the old capital of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> and still a major city for the Christians under <a href="Al-Andalus">Islamic rule in Spain</a>. He is believed to have had contacts with <a href="Beatus%20of%20Li%C3%A9bana">Beatus of Liébana</a>, from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Asturias">Kingdom of Asturias</a>, who fought against Adoptionism. At the <a href="Council%20of%20Frankfurt">Council of Frankfurt</a> in 794, Alcuin upheld the orthodox doctrine against the views expressed by <a href="Felix%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Urgel">Felix of Urgel</a>, an <a href="heresiarch">heresiarch</a> according to the Catholic Encyclopaedia. Having failed during his stay in Northumbria to influence King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelred</a> in the conduct of his reign, Alcuin never returned home.

He was back at Charlemagne's court by at least mid-792, writing a series of letters to Æthelred, to Hygbald, Bishop of <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, and to <a href="%C3%86thelhard">Æthelhard</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> in the succeeding months, dealing with the <a href="Viking">Viking</a> attack on Lindisfarne in July 793. These letters and Alcuin's poem on the subject, "De clade Lindisfarnensis monasterii", provide the only significant contemporary account of these events. In his description of the Viking attack, he wrote: ""Never before has such terror appeared in Britain. Behold the church of <a href="St%20Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a>, splattered with the blood of God's priests, robbed of its ornaments"."

In 796 Alcuin was in his sixties. He hoped to be free from court duties and upon the death of Abbot Itherius of Saint Martin at Tours, Charlemagne put <a href="Marmoutier%20Abbey%2C%20Tours">Marmoutier Abbey</a> into Alcuin's care, with the understanding that he should be available if the king ever needed his counsel. There he encouraged the work of the monks on the beautiful Carolingian minuscule script, ancestor of modern Roman typefaces.

Alcuin died on 19 May 804, some ten years before the emperor, and was buried at St. Martin's Church under an epitaph that partly read:
The majority of details on Alcuin's life come from his letters and poems. There are also autobiographical sections in Alcuin's poem on York and in the "Vita Alcuini", a "<a href="hagiography">Life</a>" written for him at Ferrières in the 820s, possibly based in part on the memories of Sigwulf, one of Alcuin's pupils.

The collection of mathematical and logical word problems entitled "Propositiones ad acuendos juvenes" ("Problems to Sharpen Youths") is sometimes attributed to Alcuin. In a 799 letter to Charlemagne the scholar claimed to have sent "certain figures of arithmetic for the joy of cleverness," which some scholars have identified with the "Propositiones."
The text contains about 53 mathematical word problems (with solutions), in no particular pedagogical order. Among the most famous of these problems are: four that involve <a href="river%20crossing%20problem">river crossings</a>, including the <a href="Jealous%20husbands%20problem">problem of three anxious brothers</a>, each of whom has an unmarried sister whom he cannot leave alone with either of the other men lest she be defiled (Problem 17); the <a href="Fox%2C%20goose%20and%20bag%20of%20beans%20puzzle">problem of the wolf, goat, and cabbage</a> (Problem 18); and the problem of "the two adults and two children where the children weigh half as much as the adults" (Problem 19). <a href="Alcuin%27s%20sequence">Alcuin's sequence</a> is the solution to one of the problems of that book.

Alcuin made the abbey school into a model of excellence and many students flocked to it. He had many manuscripts copied using outstandingly beautiful <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, the <a href="Carolingian%20minuscule">Carolingian minuscule</a> based on round and legible <a href="uncial">uncial</a> letters. He wrote many letters to his English friends, to <a href="Arno%20of%20Salzburg">Arno, bishop of Salzburg</a> and above all to <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>. These letters (of which 311 are extant) are filled mainly with pious meditations, but they form an important source of information as to the literary and social conditions of the time and are the most reliable authority for the history of <a href="humanism">humanism</a> during the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> age. Alcuin trained the numerous monks of the abbey in piety, and it was in the midst of these pursuits that he died.

Alcuin is the most prominent figure of the <a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian Renaissance</a>, in which three main periods have been distinguished: in the first of these, up to the arrival of Alcuin at the court, the Italians occupy a central place; in the second, Alcuin and the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> are dominant; in the third (from 804), the influence of <a href="Theodulf%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Theodulf, the Visigoth</a> is preponderant.

Alcuin also developed manuals used in his educational work – a <a href="grammar">grammar</a> and works on <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and <a href="dialectics">dialectics</a>. These are written in the form of <a href="dialogues">dialogues</a>, and in two of them the interlocutors are Charlemagne and Alcuin. He wrote several <a href="theological">theological</a> treatises: a "De fide Trinitatis", and commentaries on the Bible. Alcuin is credited with inventing the first known <a href="question%20mark">question mark</a>, though it didn't resemble the modern symbol.

Alcuin transmitted to the <a href="Franks">Franks</a> the knowledge of Latin culture which had existed in Anglo-Saxon England. A number of his works still exist. Besides some graceful epistles in the style of <a href="Venantius%20Fortunatus">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, he wrote some long poems, and notably he is the author of a history (in verse) of the church at York, "Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae".

Passages in Alcuin's writings have been seen to exhibit <a href="homosocial">homosocial</a> desire, possibly even homoerotic imagery. David Clark suggests it is not possible to determine whether Alcuin's homosocial desires were the result of an outward expression of erotic feelings. Historian <a href="John%20Boswell">John Boswell</a> cited this as a personal outpouring of Alcuin's internalized <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> feelings. Others agree that Alcuin at times "comes perilously close to communicating openly his same sex desires", and this reflects the erotic subculture of the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> monastic school, but also perhaps a 'queer space' where "erotic attachment and affections may be safely articulated”.

Erotic and religious love are intertwined in Alcuin's writings, and he frequently "eroticizes his personal relationships to his beloved friends”. Alcuin's friendships also extended to the ladies of the court, especially the queen mother and the king's daughters, though his relationships with these women never reached the intense level of those of the men around him.

The interpretation of homosexual desire has been disputed by <a href="Allen%20Frantzen">Allen Frantzen</a>, who identifies Alcuin's language with that of medieval Christian "amicitia" or friendship. Karl Liersch, in his 1880 inaugural dissertation, cites several passages from poems by <a href="Theodulf%20of%20Orleans">Theodulf of Orleans</a>. In these poems Theodulf reports that Alcuin had a female muse named Delia in the king's court (she was probably Charlemagne's daughter). Delia is also the addressee of several poems by Alcuin.

David Dales and <a href="Rowan%20Williams">Rowan Williams</a> say "the use of language drawn [by Alcuin] from the "Song of Songs" transforms apparently erotic language into something within Christian friendship - 'an ordained affection'."

Despite inconclusive evidence of Alcuin's personal passions, he was clear in his own writings that the men of <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom</a> had been punished with fire for "sinning against nature with men" - a view commonly held by the Church at the time. Such sins, argued Alcuin, were therefore more serious than lustful acts with women, for which the earth was cleansed and revivified by the water of the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Flood</a>, and merit to be "withered by flames unto eternal barrenness."

In several churches of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, Alcuin is celebrated on 20 May, the first available day after the day of his death (as <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a> is celebrated on 19 May).

<a href="Alcuin%20College">Alcuin College</a>, one of the <a href="colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20York">colleges of the University of York</a>, England, is named after him.

Angilbert

Saint Angilbert ( – 18 February 814), sometimes known as Angilberk or Engelbert, was a noble <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> poet who was educated under <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> and served <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> as a secretary, diplomat, and son-in-law. He was venerated as a <a href="pre-Congregation">pre-Congregation</a> <a href="saint">saint</a> and is still honored on the day of his death, 18 February.

Angilbert seems to have been brought up at the court of Charlemagne at the palace school in Aquae Grani (<a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>). He was educated there as the pupil and then friend of the great English scholar Alcuin. When Charlemagne sent his young son <a href="Pepin%20of%20Italy">Pepin</a> to Italy as King of the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> Angilbert went along as "primicerius palatii," a high administrator of the satellite court. As the friend and adviser of Pepin, he assisted for a while in the government of Italy. Angilbert delivered the document on <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">Iconoclasm</a> from the Frankish Synod of Frankfurt to <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20I">Pope Adrian I</a>, and was later sent on three important embassies to the pope, in 792, 794, and 796. At one time, he served an officer of the maritime provinces. He accompanied Charlemagne to Rome in 800 and was one of the <a href="Testament%20of%20Charlemagne">witnesses to his will in 811</a>.

There are various traditions concerning Angilbert's relationship with <a href="Bertha%2C%20daughter%20of%20Charlemagne">Bertha, daughter of Charlemagne</a>. One holds that they were married, another that they were not. They had, however, at least two sons, one of whom, <a href="Nithard">Nithard</a>, became a notable figure in the mid-9th century. Control of marriage and the meanings of legitimacy were hotly contested in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Bertha and Angilbert are an example of how resistance to the idea of a sacramental marriage could coincide with holding church offices. On the other hand, some historians have speculated that Charlemagne opposed formal marriages for his daughters out of concern for political rivalries from their potential husbands; none of Charlemagne's daughters were married, despite political offers of arranged marriages.

In 790, he retired to the abbey of Centulum, the "Monastery of St Richarius" () at present-day <a href="Saint-Riquier">Saint-Riquier</a> in <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a>. Elected <a href="abbot">abbot</a> in 794, he rebuilt the monastery and endowed it with a library of 200 volumes. It was not uncommon for the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a>, <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a>, or later kings to make laymen abbots of monasteries; the layman would often use the income of the monastery as his own and leave the monks a bare minimum for the necessary expenses of the foundation. Angilbert, in contrast, spent a great deal rebuilding Saint-Riquier; when he completed it, Charlemagne spent Easter of the year 800 there. In keeping with Carolingian policies, Angilbert established a school at Saint-Riquier to educate the local boys.

His Latin poems reveal the culture and tastes of a man of the world, enjoying the closest intimacy with the imperial family. Charlemagne and the other men at court were known by affectionate and jesting nicknames. Charlemagne was referred to as "David", a reference to the Biblical king <a href="David">David</a>. Angilbert was nicknamed "<a href="Homer">Homer</a>" because he wrote poetry, and was the probable author of an <a href="epic%20poetry">epic</a>, of which the fragment which has been preserved describes the life at the palace and the meeting between Charlemagne and Leo III. It is a mosaic from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="Lucan">Lucan</a> and <a href="Venantius%20Fortunatus">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, composed in the manner of Einhard's use of Suetonius. Of the shorter poems, besides the greeting to Pippin on his return from the campaign against the <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a> (796), an epistle to David (i.e., Charlemagne) incidentally reveals a delightful picture of the poet living with his children in a house surrounded by pleasant gardens near the emperor's palace. The reference to Bertha, however, is distant and respectful, her name occurring merely on the list of princesses to whom he sends his salutation.

Angilbert's poems were published by <a href="Ernst%20D%C3%BCmmler">Ernst Dümmler</a> in the "<a href="Monumenta%20Germaniae%20Historica">Monumenta Germaniae Historica</a>". For criticisms of this edition, see <a href="Ludwig%20Traube%20%28palaeographer%29">Ludwig Traube</a> in Max Roediger's "Schriften für germanische Philologie" (1888).

Amine

In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, amines (, ) are <a href="organic%20compound">compounds</a> and <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s that contain a <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> <a href="atom">atom</a> with a <a href="lone%20pair">lone pair</a>. Amines are formally <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, wherein one or more <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atoms have been replaced by a <a href="substituent">substituent</a> such as an <a href="alkyl">alkyl</a> or <a href="aryl">aryl</a> group (these may respectively be called alkylamines and arylamines; amines in which both types of substituent are attached to one nitrogen atom may be called alkylarylamines). Important amines include <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, <a href="biogenic%20amine">biogenic amine</a>s, <a href="trimethylamine">trimethylamine</a>, and <a href="aniline">aniline</a>; see for a list of amines. <a href="Inorganic%20compound">Inorganic</a> derivatives of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> are also called amines, such as <a href="chloramine">chloramine</a> (NClH); see .

Compounds with a nitrogen atom attached to a <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> group, thus having the structure R–CO–NR′R″, are called <a href="amide">amide</a>s and have different chemical properties from amines.

An aliphatic amine has no <a href="aromatic%20ring">aromatic ring</a> attached directly to the nitrogen atom. <a href="Aromatic%20amine">Aromatic amine</a>s have the nitrogen atom connected to an <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a> ring as in the various <a href="aniline">aniline</a>s. The aromatic ring decreases the <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">alkalinity</a> of the amine, depending on its substituents. The presence of an amine group strongly increases the reactivity of the aromatic ring, due to an electron-donating effect.

Amines are organized into four subcategories:


It is also possible to have four organic substituents on the nitrogen. These species are not amines but are <a href="quaternary%20ammonium%20cation">quaternary ammonium cation</a>s and have a charged nitrogen center. Quaternary ammonium salts exist with many kinds of anions.

Amines are named in several ways. Typically, the compound is given the prefix "amino-" or the suffix: "-amine". The prefix ""N"-" shows substitution on the nitrogen atom. An organic compound with multiple amino groups is called a diamine, triamine, tetraamine and so forth.

Systematic names for some common amines:
<a href="Hydrogen%20bonding">Hydrogen bonding</a> significantly influences the properties of primary and secondary amines. Thus the <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> and <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a> of amines is higher than those of the corresponding <a href="phosphine">phosphine</a>s, but generally lower than those of the corresponding <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s and <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s. For example, <a href="Methylamine">methyl</a> and <a href="Ethylamine">ethyl</a> amines are gases under standard conditions, whereas the corresponding <a href="Methanol">methyl</a> and <a href="Ethanol">ethyl</a> alcohols are liquids. Amines possess a characteristic ammonia smell, liquid amines have a distinctive "fishy" smell.

The nitrogen atom features a <a href="lone%20electron%20pair">lone electron pair</a> that can bind H to form an <a href="ammonium%20ion">ammonium ion</a> RNH. The lone electron pair is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water <a href="solubility">solubility</a> of simple amines is enhanced by <a href="hydrogen%20bonding">hydrogen bonding</a> involving these lone electron pairs. Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium () > secondary ammonium () > tertiary ammonium (RNH). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic. Aromatic amines, such as <a href="aniline">aniline</a>, have their lone pair electrons <a href="conjugated%20system">conjugated</a> into the benzene ring, thus their tendency to engage in hydrogen bonding is diminished. Their boiling points are high and their solubility in water is low.

Alkyl amines characteristically feature tetrahedral nitrogen centers. C-N-C and C-N-H angles approach the idealized angle of 109°. C-N distances are slightly shorter than C-C distances. The energy barrier for the <a href="nitrogen%20inversion">nitrogen inversion</a> of the stereocenter is about 7 <a href="kcal/mol">kcal/mol</a> for a trialkylamine. The interconversion has been compared to the inversion of an open umbrella into a strong wind.

Amines of the type NHRR′ and NRR′R″ are <a href="chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chiral</a>: the nitrogen center bears four substituents counting the lone pair. Because of the low barrier to inversion, amines of the type NHRR′ cannot be obtained in optical purity. For chiral tertiary amines, NRR′R″ can only be resolved when the R, R′, and R″ groups are constrained in cyclic structures such as N-substituted <a href="aziridine">aziridine</a>s (<a href="quaternary%20ammonium%20salt">quaternary ammonium salt</a>s are resolvable).
In aromatic amines ("anilines"), nitrogen is often nearly planar owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent. The C-N distance is correspondingly shorter. In aniline, the C-N distance is the same as the C-C distances.

Like ammonia, amines are <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">bases</a>. Compared to alkali metal hydroxides, amines are weaker (see table for examples of <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate acid</a> "K" values). 

The basicity of amines depends on:

Owing to inductive effects, the basicity of an amine might be expected to increase with the number of alkyl groups on the amine. Correlations are complicated owing to the effects of solvation which are opposite the trends for inductive effects. Solvation effects also dominate the basicity of aromatic amines (anilines). For anilines, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen delocalises into the ring, resulting in decreased basicity. Substituents on the aromatic ring, and their positions relative to the amine group, also affect basicity as seen in the table.

Solvation significantly affects the basicity of amines. N-H groups strongly interact with water, especially in ammonium ions. Consequently, the basicity of ammonia is enhanced by 10 by solvation. The intrinsic basicity of amines, i.e. the situation where solvation is unimportant, has been evaluated in the gas phase. In the gas phase, amines exhibit the basicities predicted from the electron-releasing effects of the organic substituents. Thus tertiary amines are more basic than secondary amines, which are more basic than primary amines, and finally ammonia is least basic. The order of pK's (basicities in water) does not follow this order. Similarly aniline is more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.

In aprotic polar solvents such as <a href="Dimethyl%20sulfoxide">DMSO</a>, <a href="Dimethylformamide">DMF</a>, and <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a> the energy of solvation is not as high as in protic polar solvents like water and methanol. For this reason, the basicity of amines in these aprotic solvents is almost solely governed by the electronic factors.

The most industrially significant amines are prepared from ammonia by <a href="alkylation">alkylation</a> with alcohols:
These reactions require catalysts, specialized apparatus, and additional purification measures since the selectivity can be problematic. The same amines can be prepared by treatment of <a href="haloalkanes">haloalkanes</a> with ammonia and amines:
Such reactions, which are most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, are rarely employed because the degree of alkylation is difficult to control. Selectivity can be improved via the <a href="Del%C3%A9pine%20reaction">Delépine reaction</a>, although this is rarely employed on an industrial scale.

Via the process of <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a>s are reduced to amines using hydrogen in the presence of a nickel catalyst. Reactions are sensitive to acidic or alkaline conditions, which can cause hydrolysis of the –CN group. LiAlH is more commonly employed for the reduction of nitriles on the laboratory scale. Similarly, LiAlH reduces <a href="amide">amide</a>s to amines. Many amines are produced from aldehydes and ketones via <a href="reductive%20amination">reductive amination</a>, which can either proceed catalytically or stoichiometrically.

<a href="Aniline">Aniline</a> (CHNH) and its derivatives are prepared by reduction of the nitroaromatics. In industry, hydrogen is the preferred reductant, whereas, in the laboratory, tin and iron are often employed.

Many laboratory methods exist for the preparation of amines, many of these methods being rather specialized.

Aside from their basicity, the dominant reactivity of amines is their <a href="nucleophilic%20acyl%20substitution">nucleophilicity</a>. Most primary amines are good <a href="ligand">ligand</a>s for metal ions to give <a href="coordination%20complex">coordination complex</a>es. Amines are alkylated by alkyl halides. <a href="Acyl%20chloride">Acyl chloride</a>s and <a href="Organic%20acid%20anhydride">acid anhydride</a>s react with primary and secondary amines to form <a href="amide">amide</a>s (the "<a href="Schotten%E2%80%93Baumann%20reaction">Schotten–Baumann reaction</a>").

Similarly, with sulfonyl chlorides, one obtains <a href="sulfonamide">sulfonamide</a>s. This transformation, known as the <a href="Hinsberg%20reaction">Hinsberg reaction</a>, is a chemical test for the presence of amines.

Because amines are basic, they neutralize <a href="acid">acid</a>s to form the corresponding <a href="ammonium%20salt">ammonium salt</a>s RNH. When formed from carboxylic acids and primary and secondary amines, these salts thermally dehydrate to form the corresponding <a href="amide">amide</a>s.

Amines react with <a href="nitrous%20acid">nitrous acid</a> to give diazonium salts. The alkyl diazonium salts are of little synthetic importance because they are too unstable. The most important members are derivatives of aromatic amines such as <a href="aniline">aniline</a> ("phenylamine") (A = aryl or naphthyl):

Anilines and naphthylamines form more stable <a href="diazonium">diazonium</a> salts, which can be isolated in the crystalline form. Diazonium salts undergo a variety of useful transformations involving replacement of the N group with anions. For example, <a href="Copper%28I%29%20cyanide">cuprous cyanide</a> gives the corresponding nitriles:

Aryldiazonium couple with electron-rich aromatic compounds such as a <a href="phenol">phenol</a> to form <a href="azo%20compound">azo compound</a>s. Such reactions are widely applied to the production of dyes.

<a href="Alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution">Imine formation</a> is an important reaction. Primary amines react with <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s and <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s to form <a href="imine">imine</a>s. In the case of <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> (R′  H), these products typically exist as cyclic <a href="trimer%20%28chemistry%29">trimers</a>.
Reduction of these imines gives secondary amines:

Similarly, secondary amines react with ketones and aldehydes to form <a href="enamine">enamine</a>s:

An overview of the reactions of amines is given below:
Amines are ubiquitous in biology. The breakdown of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s releases amines, famously in the case of decaying fish which smell of <a href="trimethylamine">trimethylamine</a>. Many <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s are amines, including <a href="epinephrine">epinephrine</a>, <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a>, <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a>, <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>, and <a href="histamine">histamine</a>. <a href="Protonated">Protonated</a> <a href="amino%20group">amino group</a>s () are the most common positively charged moieties in <a href="protein">protein</a>s, specifically in the amino acid <a href="lysine">lysine</a>. The anionic polymer <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is typically bound to various amine-rich proteins. Additionally, the terminal charged primary ammonium on lysine forms <a href="Salt%20bridge%20%28protein%20and%20supramolecular%29">salt bridges</a> with <a href="carboxylate">carboxylate</a> groups of other amino acids in <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a>s, which is one of the primary influences on the three-dimensional structures of proteins.

Primary aromatic amines are used as a starting material for the manufacture of <a href="azo%20dye">azo dye</a>s. It reacts with nitrous acid to form diazonium salt, which can undergo coupling reaction to form an azo compound. As azo-compounds are highly coloured, they are widely used in dyeing industries, such as:


Many drugs are designed to mimic or to interfere with the action of natural amine <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s, exemplified by the amine drugs:

Aqueous <a href="monoethanolamine">monoethanolamine</a> (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), <a href="diethanolamine">diethanolamine</a> (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and <a href="N-methyl-diethanolamine">methyldiethanolamine</a> (MDEA) are widely used industrially for removing <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO) and <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> (HS) from natural gas and refinery process streams. They may also be used to remove CO from combustion gases and <a href="flue%20gas">flue gas</a>es and may have potential for abatement of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es. Related processes are known as <a href="Amine%20gas%20treating">sweetening</a>.

Low molecular weight amines, such as <a href="ethylamine">ethylamine</a>, are toxic, and some are easily absorbed through the skin. Many higher molecular weight amines are, biologically, highly active.

Absolute zero

Absolute zero is the lower limit of the <a href="thermodynamic%20temperature">thermodynamic temperature</a> scale, a state at which the <a href="enthalpy">enthalpy</a> and <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of a cooled <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a> reaches its minimum value, taken as 0. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a>; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a> scale (<a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a>), which equates to −459.67° on the <a href="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a> scale (<a href="United%20States%20customary%20units">United States customary units</a> or <a href="Imperial%20units">Imperial units</a>). The corresponding <a href="Kelvin">Kelvin</a> and <a href="Rankine%20scale">Rankine</a> temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.

It is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible, but it is not the lowest "enthalpy" state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the <a href="enthalpy%20of%20vaporization">enthalpy of vaporization</a> (gas to liquid) and <a href="enthalpy%20of%20fusion">enthalpy of fusion</a> (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum-mechanical</a> description, matter (solid) at absolute zero is in its <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>, the point of lowest <a href="internal%20energy">internal energy</a>.

The <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a> indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent <a href="asymptotically">asymptotically</a>, and a system at absolute zero still possesses <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> <a href="zero-point%20energy">zero-point energy</a>, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero. The <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> of the ground state cannot be removed. 
Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">quantum effects</a> such as <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> and <a href="superfluidity">superfluidity</a>.

At temperatures near , nearly all molecular motion ceases and Δ"S" = 0 for any <a href="adiabatic%20process">adiabatic process</a>, where "S" is the <a href="entropy">entropy</a>. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form perfect <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s as "T" → 0. <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a>'s strong form of the <a href="third%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">third law of thermodynamics</a> states the <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero. The original <a href="Walther%20Nernst">Nernst</a> "<a href="Nernst%20heat%20theorem">heat theorem</a>" makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any <a href="isothermal%20process">isothermal process</a> approaches zero as "T" → 0:

The implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal simply approaches a constant value.

The <a href="Third%20Law%20of%20Thermodynamics">Nernst postulate</a> identifies the <a href="isothermal%20process">isotherm</a> T = 0 as coincident with the <a href="adiabat">adiabat</a> S = 0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can <a href="Line-line%20intersection">intersect</a> the T = 0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (≈ Callen, pp. 189–190)

A mathematical proof exists that shows the temperature of absolute zero cannot be physically achieved because it's impossible for the entropy (or disorder) of a system to cool a system to absolute zero in a finite time.

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal <a href="lattice%20%28group%29">lattice</a> structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a> along three (not usually <a href="orthogonality">orthogonal</a>) <a href="Cartesian%20coordinate%20system">axes</a>. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For <a href="chemical%20substance">substances</a> that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and <a href="graphite">graphite</a> for <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, there is a kind of "chemical degeneracy". The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at "T" = 0 even though each is perfectly ordered.

Perfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do simply get "frozen in" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.

Using the <a href="Debye%20model">Debye model</a>, the <a href="specific%20heat%20capacity">specific heat</a> and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to "T", while the <a href="enthalpy">enthalpy</a> and <a href="chemical%20potential">chemical potential</a> are proportional to "T". (Guggenheim, p. 111) These quantities drop toward their "T" = 0 limiting values and approach with "zero" slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10 K. Even the less detailed <a href="Einstein%20solid">Einstein model</a> shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of <a href="thermal%20expansion">thermal expansion</a>. <a href="Maxwell%20relations">Maxwell's relations</a> show that various other quantities also vanish. These <a href="phenomenon">phenomena</a> were unanticipated.

Since the relation between changes in <a href="Gibbs%20free%20energy">Gibbs free energy</a> ("G"), the enthalpy ("H") and the entropy is

thus, as "T" decreases, Δ"G" and Δ"H" approach each other (so long as Δ"S" is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s) result in a decrease in "G" as they proceed toward <a href="thermodynamic%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a>. If Δ"S" and/or "T" are small, the condition Δ"G" < 0 may imply that Δ"H" < 0, which would indicate an <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction. However, this is not required; <a href="endothermic">endothermic</a> reactions can proceed spontaneously if the "T"Δ"S" term is large enough.

Moreover, the slopes of the <a href="derivative">derivative</a>s of Δ"G" and Δ"H" converge and are equal to zero at "T" = 0. This ensures that Δ"G" and Δ"H" are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate <a href="empiricism">empirical</a> Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that "the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat", i.e., an actual process is the "most exothermic one". (Callen, pp. 186–187)

One model that estimates the properties of an <a href="electron">electron</a> gas at absolute zero in metals is the <a href="Fermi%20gas">Fermi gas</a>. The electrons, being <a href="Fermions">Fermions</a>, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical <a href="velocities">velocities</a>, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the <a href="Fermi%20energy">Fermi energy</a>. The <a href="Fermi%20temperature">Fermi temperature</a> is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical <a href="equipartition%20theorem">equipartition theorem</a> for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.

A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a <a href="state%20of%20matter">state of matter</a> of a dilute gas of weakly interacting <a href="boson">boson</a>s confined in an external <a href="potential">potential</a> and cooled to temperatures very near absolute zero. Under such conditions, a large fraction of the bosons occupy the lowest <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a> of the external potential, at which point quantum effects become apparent on a <a href="macroscopic%20scale">macroscopic scale</a>.

This state of matter was first predicted by <a href="Satyendra%20Nath%20Bose">Satyendra Nath Bose</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the <a href="quantum%20statistics">quantum statistics</a> of light quanta (now called <a href="photon">photon</a>s). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physik">Zeitschrift für Physik</a>", which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.

Seventy years later, in 1995, the first gaseous <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">condensate</a> was produced by <a href="Eric%20Allin%20Cornell">Eric Cornell</a> and <a href="Carl%20Wieman">Carl Wieman</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NIST</a>-<a href="JILA">JILA</a> lab, using a gas of <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> atoms cooled to 170 <a href="kelvin">nanokelvin</a>s (nK) ().

A record cold temperature of 450 ±80 pK in a <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose–Einstein condensate</a> (BEC) of sodium atoms was achieved in 2003 by researchers at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>. The associated <a href="black-body">black-body</a> (peak emittance) wavelength of 6,400 kilometers is roughly the radius of Earth.

Absolute, or <a href="thermodynamic%20temperature">thermodynamic</a>, temperature is conventionally measured in <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s (Celsius-scaled increments) and in the <a href="Rankine%20scale">Rankine scale</a> (<a href="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>-scaled increments) with increasing rarity. Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the "degree", so the "ratios" of two absolute temperatures, "T"/"T", are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the <a href="Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann%20distribution">Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution</a>. It can also be found in <a href="Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac%20statistics">Fermi–Dirac statistics</a> (for particles of half-integer <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>) and <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a> (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing <a href="exponential%20function">exponential function</a>s of energy (at the particle level) over "kT", with "k" representing the <a href="Boltzmann%20constant">Boltzmann constant</a> and "T" representing the temperature observed at the <a href="macroscopic">macroscopic</a> level.

Temperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a> or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain <a href="system%20%28thermodynamics%29">systems</a> can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their <a href="thermodynamic%20temperature">thermodynamic temperature</a> (expressed in kelvins) can be of a <a href="Negative%20number">negative</a> quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than "any" system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.

Most familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their <a href="entropy">entropy</a>. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added. As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state , so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.

On 3 January 2013, physicists announced that they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom for the first time.

One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>. His 1665 "New Experiments and Observations touching Cold", articulated the dispute known as the "primum frigidum". The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four <a href="classical%20element">classical element</a>s), others within water, others air, and some more recently within <a href="niter">nitre</a>. But all of them seemed to agree that, "There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality."

The question whether there is a limit to the degree of coldness possible, and, if so, where the zero must be placed, was first addressed by the French physicist <a href="Guillaume%20Amontons">Guillaume Amontons</a> in 1702, in connection with his improvements in the <a href="gas%20thermometer">air-thermometer</a>. His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury—the volume, or "spring" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling-point of water at +73 and the melting-point of ice at 51, so that the zero was equivalent to about −240 on the Celsius scale.

This close approximation to the modern value of −273.15 °C for the zero of the air-thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a>, who observed that might be regarded as absolute cold.

Values of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing-point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below. <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a> in his "Chemical Philosophy" gave ten calculations of this value, and finally adopted −3000 °C as the natural zero of temperature.

After <a href="James%20Prescott%20Joule">James Prescott Joule</a> had determined the mechanical equivalent of heat, <a href="William%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> approached the question from an entirely different point of view, and in 1848 devised a scale of absolute temperature that was independent of the properties of any particular substance and was based on <a href="Nicolas%20L%C3%A9onard%20Sadi%20Carnot">Carnot's</a> theory of the Motive Power of Heat and data published by <a href="Henri%20Victor%20Regnault">Henri Victor Regnault</a>. It followed from the principles on which this scale was constructed that its zero was placed at −273 °C, at almost precisely the same point as the zero of the air-thermometer. This value was not immediately accepted; values ranging from to , derived from laboratory measurements and observations of <a href="Atmospheric%20refraction%23Astronomical%20refraction">astronomical refraction</a>, remained in use in the early 20th century.

With a better theoretical understanding of absolute zero, scientists were eager to reach this temperature in the lab. By 1845, <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching . Faraday believed that certain gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, were permanent gases and could not be liquified. Decades later, in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist <a href="Johannes%20Diderik%20van%20der%20Waals">Johannes Diderik van der Waals</a> demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied, but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures. In 1877, <a href="Louis%20Paul%20Cailletet">Louis Paul Cailletet</a> in France and <a href="Raoul%20Pictet">Raoul Pictet</a> in Switzerland succeeded in producing the first droplets of <a href="liquid%20air">liquid air</a> . This was followed in 1883 by the production of liquid oxygen by the Polish professors <a href="Zygmunt%20Wr%C3%B3blewski">Zygmunt Wróblewski</a> and <a href="Karol%20Olszewski">Karol Olszewski</a>.

Scottish chemist and physicist <a href="James%20Dewar">James Dewar</a> and rival <a href="Heike%20Kamerlingh%20Onnes">Heike Kamerlingh Onnes</a> took on the challenge to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium. In 1898, after 20 years of effort, Dewar was first to liquefy hydrogen, reaching a new low temperature record of . However Onnes, his rival, was the first to liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the <a href="Hampson%E2%80%93Linde%20cycle">Hampson–Linde cycle</a>. He lowered the temperature to the boiling point of helium . By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the <a href="Lowest%20temperature%20recorded%20on%20Earth">coldest temperatures achieved on earth</a> at the time and his achievement earned him the <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in 1913. Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> and <a href="superfluids">superfluids</a> for the first time.

The average temperature of the universe today is approximately , based on measurements of <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>.

Absolute zero cannot be achieved, although it is possible to reach temperatures close to it through the use of <a href="cryocoolers">cryocoolers</a>, <a href="dilution%20refrigerator">dilution refrigerator</a>s, and <a href="Magnetic%20refrigeration%23Nuclear%20demagnetization">nuclear adiabatic demagnetization</a>.

Adiabatic process

In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of <a href="heat">heat</a> or <a href="matter">matter</a> between a <a href="thermodynamic%20system">thermodynamic system</a> and its surroundings. In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to its surroundings only as <a href="Work%20%28thermodynamics%29">work</a>. The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the <a href="first%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">first law of thermodynamics</a>, and as such it is a key concept in <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>.

Some chemical and physical processes occur so rapidly that they may be conveniently described by the term "adiabatic approximation", meaning that there is not enough time for the transfer of energy as heat to take place to or from the system.

By way of example, the <a href="adiabatic%20flame%20temperature">adiabatic flame temperature</a> is an idealization that uses the "adiabatic approximation" so as to provide an upper limit calculation of temperatures produced by combustion of a fuel. The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that would be achieved by a <a href="fire">flame</a> if the process of combustion took place in the absence of heat loss to the surroundings.

A process that does not involve the transfer of heat or matter into or out of a system, so that , is called an adiabatic process, and such a system is said to be adiabatically isolated. The assumption that a process is adiabatic is a frequently made simplifying assumption. For example, the compression of a gas within a cylinder of an engine is assumed to occur so rapidly that on the time scale of the compression process, little of the system's energy can be transferred out as heat to the surroundings. Even though the cylinders are not insulated and are quite conductive, that process is idealized to be adiabatic. The same can be said to be true for the expansion process of such a system.

The assumption of adiabatic isolation of a system is a useful one, and is often combined with others so as to make the calculation of the system's behaviour possible. Such assumptions are idealizations. The behaviour of actual machines deviates from these idealizations, but the assumption of such "perfect" behaviour provide a useful first approximation of how the real world works. According to <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Laplace</a>, when sound travels in a gas, there is no time for heat conduction in the medium and so the propagation of sound is adiabatic. For such an adiabatic process, the <a href="Elastic%20modulus">modulus of elasticity</a> (<a href="Young%27s%20modulus">Young's modulus</a>) can be expressed as , where is the <a href="Heat%20capacity%20ratio">ratio of specific heats</a> at constant pressure and at constant volume ( ) and is the pressure of the gas .

For a closed system, one may write the <a href="first%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">first law of thermodynamics</a> as : , where denotes the change of the system's internal energy, the quantity of energy added to it as heat, and the work done on it by its surroundings.


Naturally occurring adiabatic processes are irreversible (entropy is produced).

The transfer of energy as work into an adiabatically isolated system can be imagined as being of two idealized extreme kinds. In one such kind, there is no entropy produced within the system (no friction, viscous dissipation, etc.), and the work is only pressure-volume work (denoted by ). In nature, this ideal kind occurs only approximately, because it demands an infinitely slow process and no sources of dissipation.

The other extreme kind of work is isochoric work (), for which energy is added as work solely through friction or viscous dissipation within the system. A stirrer that transfers energy to a viscous fluid of an adiabatically isolated system with rigid walls, without phase change, will cause a rise in temperature of the fluid, but that work is not recoverable. Isochoric work is irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics observes that a natural process, of transfer of energy as work, always consists at least of isochoric work and often both of these extreme kinds of work. Every natural process, adiabatic or not, is irreversible, with , as friction or viscosity are always present to some extent.

The adiabatic compression of a gas causes a rise in temperature of the gas. Adiabatic expansion against pressure, or a spring, causes a drop in temperature. In contrast, <a href="free%20expansion">free expansion</a> is an <a href="isothermal">isothermal</a> process for an ideal gas.

Adiabatic heating occurs when the pressure of a gas is increased from work done on it by its surroundings, e.g., a <a href="piston">piston</a> compressing a gas contained within a cylinder and raising the temperature where in many practical situations heat conduction through walls can be slow compared with the compression time. This finds practical application in <a href="diesel%20engines">diesel engines</a> which rely on the lack of heat dissipation during the compression stroke to elevate the fuel vapor temperature sufficiently to ignite it.

Adiabatic heating occurs in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> when an <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a> descends, for example, in a <a href="katabatic%20wind">katabatic wind</a>, <a href="Foehn%20wind">Foehn wind</a>, or <a href="chinook%20wind">chinook wind</a> flowing downhill over a mountain range. When a parcel of air descends, the pressure on the parcel increases. Due to this increase in pressure, the parcel's volume decreases and its temperature increases as work is done on the parcel of air, thus increasing its internal energy, which manifests itself by a rise in the temperature of that mass of air. The parcel of air can only slowly dissipate the energy by conduction or radiation (heat), and to a first approximation it can be considered adiabatically isolated and the process an adiabatic process.

Adiabatic cooling occurs when the pressure on an adiabatically isolated system is decreased, allowing it to expand, thus causing it to do work on its surroundings. When the pressure applied on a parcel of air is reduced, the air in the parcel is allowed to expand; as the volume increases, the temperature falls as its internal energy decreases. Adiabatic cooling occurs in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> with <a href="orographic%20lifting">orographic lifting</a> and <a href="lee%20waves">lee waves</a>, and this can form <a href="Pileus%20%28meteorology%29">pileus</a> or <a href="lenticular%20cloud">lenticular cloud</a>s.

Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via <a href="adiabatic%20demagnetization">adiabatic demagnetisation</a>, where the change in <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an <a href="expanding%20universe">expanding universe</a> can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid. (See <a href="heat%20death%20of%20the%20universe">heat death of the universe</a>.)

Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as <a href="kimberlite">kimberlite</a>s.

Such temperature changes can be quantified using the <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a>, or the <a href="hydrostatic%20equation">hydrostatic equation</a> for atmospheric processes.

In practice, no process is truly adiabatic. Many processes rely on a large difference in time scales of the process of interest and the rate of heat dissipation across a system boundary, and thus are approximated by using an adiabatic assumption. There is always some heat loss, as no perfect insulators exist.

The mathematical equation for an <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a> undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the <a href="polytropic%20process">polytropic process</a> equation 
where is pressure, is volume, and for this case where 

For a monatomic ideal gas, , and for a diatomic gas (such as <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, the main components of <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">air</a>) . Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose–Einstein</a> or <a href="Fermionic%20condensate">Fermi gases</a>.

For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that

where "T" is an absolute temperature. This can also be written as

The compression stroke in a <a href="gasoline%20engine">gasoline engine</a> can be used as an example of adiabatic compression. The model assumptions are: the uncompressed volume of the cylinder is one litre (1 l = 1000 cm = 0.001 m ); the gas within is the air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen only (thus a diatomic gas with five degrees of freedom and so ); the compression ratio of the engine is 10:1 (that is, the 1 l volume of uncompressed gas is reduced to 0.1 l by the piston); and the uncompressed gas is at approximately room temperature and pressure (a warm room temperature of ~27 °C or 300 K, and a pressure of 1 bar = 100 kPa, i.e. typical sea-level atmospheric pressure).

so our adiabatic constant for this example is about 6.31 Pa m.

The gas is now compressed to a 0.1 l (0.0001 m) volume (we will assume this happens quickly enough that no heat can enter or leave the gas through the walls). The adiabatic constant remains the same, but with the resulting pressure unknown

so solving for P:

or 25.1 bar. Note that this pressure increase is more than a simple 10:1 compression ratio would indicate; this is because the gas is not only compressed, but the work done to compress the gas also increases its internal energy which manifests itself by a rise in the gas's temperature and an additional rise in pressure above what would result from a simplistic calculation of 10 times the original pressure.

We can solve for the temperature of the compressed gas in the engine cylinder as well, using the ideal gas law, PV=nRT (n is amount of gas in mol and R the gas constant for that gas). Our initial conditions being 100 kPa of pressure, 1 l volume, and 300 K of temperature, our experimental constant (=nR) is:

We know the compressed gas has  = 0.1 l and  = , so we can solve for temperature:

Exponentiate both sides, and substitute with , the <a href="heat%20capacity%20ratio">heat capacity ratio</a>

and eliminate the negative sign to obtain

Therefore,

and

Substituting the ideal gas law into the above, we obtain

which simplifies to

The change in internal energy of a system, measured from state 1 to state 2, is equal to

At the same time, the work done by the pressure-volume changes as a result from this process, is equal to

Since we require the process to be adiabatic, the following equation needs to be true

An adiabat is a curve of constant <a href="entropy">entropy</a> in a diagram. Some properties of adiabats on a "P"–"V" diagram are indicated. These properties may be read from the classical behaviour of ideal gases, except in the region where "PV" becomes small (low temperature), where quantum effects become important.


The following diagram is a "P"–"V" diagram with a superposition of adiabats and isotherms:

The isotherms are the red curves and the adiabats are the black curves.

The adiabats are isentropic.

Volume is the horizontal axis and pressure is the vertical axis.

The term "adiabatic" () is an anglicization of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> term ἀδιάβατος "impassable" (used by <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a> of rivers).
It is used in the thermodynamic sense by <a href="William%20John%20Macquorn%20Rankine">Rankine</a> (1866), and adopted by <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">Maxwell</a> in 1871 (explicitly attributing the term to Rankine). 
The etymological origin corresponds here to an impossibility of <a href="Heat">transfer of energy as heat</a> and of transfer of matter across the wall. 

The Greek word ἀδιάβατος is formed from <a href="privative%20a">privative ἀ-</a> ("not") and διαβατός, "passable", in turn deriving from διά ("through"), and βαῖνειν ("to walk, go, come").

The adiabatic process has been important for thermodynamics since its early days. It was important in the work of Joule, because it provided a way of nearly directly relating quantities of heat and work.

For a thermodynamic system that is enclosed by walls that do not allow <a href="mass%20transfer">mass transfer</a>, energy can pass in and out only as heat or work. Thus a quantity of work can be related almost directly to an equivalent quantity of heat in a cycle of two limbs. The first is an isochoric adiabatic work process that adds to the system's <a href="internal%20energy">internal energy</a>. Then an isochoric and workless heat transfer returns the system to its original state. The first limb adds a definite amount of energy and the second removes it. Accordingly, Rankine measured quantity of heat in units of work, rather than as a calorimetric quantity . In 1854, Rankine used a quantity that he called "the thermodynamic function" that later was called entropy, and at that time he wrote also of the "curve of no transmission of heat", which he later called an adiabatic curve. Besides it two isothermal limbs, Carnot's cycle has two adiabatic limbs.

For the foundations of thermodynamics, the conceptual importance of this was emphasized by Bryan, by Carathéodory, and by Born. The reason is that calorimetry presupposes a type of temperature as already defined before the statement of the first law of thermodynamics, such as one based on empirical scales. Such a presupposition involves making the distinction between empirical temperature and absolute temperature. Rather, the definition of absolute thermodynamic temperature is best left till the second law is available as a conceptual basis.

In the eighteenth century, the law of conservation of energy was yet to be fully formulated or established, and the nature of heat was debated. One approach to these problems was to regard heat, measured by calorimetry, as a primary substance that is conserved in quantity. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it was recognized as a form of energy, and the law of conservation of energy was thereby also recognized. The view that eventually established itself, and is currently regarded as right, is that the law of conservation of energy is a primary axiom, and that heat is to be analyzed as consequential. In this light, heat cannot be a component of the total energy of a single body because it is not a <a href="State%20function">state variable</a>, but, rather, is a variable that describes a process of transfer between two bodies. The adiabatic process is important because it is a logical ingredient of this current view.

This present article is written from the viewpoint of macroscopic thermodynamics, and the word "adiabatic" is used in this article in the traditional way of thermodynamics, introduced by Rankine. It is pointed out in the present article that, for example, if a compression of a gas is rapid, then there is little time for heat transfer to occur, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall. In this sense, a rapid compression of a gas is sometimes approximately or loosely said to be "adiabatic", though often far from isentropic, even when the gas is not adiabatically isolated by a definite wall.

<a href="Quantum%20mechanics">Quantum mechanics</a> and <a href="quantum%20statistical%20mechanics">quantum statistical mechanics</a>, however, use the word "adiabatic" <a href="Adiabatic%20theorem%23Diabatic%20vs.%20adiabatic%20processes">in a very different sense</a>, one that can at times seem almost opposite to the classical thermodynamic sense. In quantum theory, the word "adiabatic" can mean something perhaps near isentropic, or perhaps near quasi-static, but the usage of the word is very different between the two disciplines.

On the one hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done almost infinitely slowly (that is to say quasi-statically), it is said to have been done "adiabatically". The idea is that the shapes of the eigenfunctions change slowly and continuously, so that no quantum jump is triggered, and the change is virtually reversible. While the occupation numbers are unchanged, nevertheless there is change in the energy levels of one-to-one corresponding, pre- and post-compression, eigenstates. Thus a perturbative element of work has been done without heat transfer and without introduction of random change within the system. For example, <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> writes "Actually, it is usually the 'adiabatic' case with which we have to do: i.e. the limiting case where the external force (or the reaction of the parts of the system on each other) acts very slowly. In this case, to a very high approximation

that is, there is no probability for a transition, and the system is in the initial state after cessation of the perturbation. Such a slow perturbation is therefore reversible, as it is classically."

On the other hand, in quantum theory, if a perturbative element of compressive work is done rapidly, it randomly changes the occupation numbers of the eigenstates, as well as changing their shapes. In that theory, such a rapid change is said not to be "adiabatic", and the contrary word "<a href="Adiabatic%20theorem%23Diabatic%20vs.%20adiabatic%20processes">diabatic</a>" is applied to it. One might guess that perhaps Clausius, if he were confronted with this, in the now-obsolete language he used in his day, would have said that "internal work" was done and that 'heat was generated though not transferred'.

In classical thermodynamics, such a rapid change would still be called adiabatic because the system is adiabatically isolated, and there is no transfer of energy as heat. The strong irreversibility of the change, due to viscosity or other entropy production, does not impinge on this classical usage.

Thus for a mass of gas, in macroscopic thermodynamics, words are so used that a compression is sometimes loosely or approximately said to be adiabatic if it is rapid enough to avoid heat transfer, even if the system is not adiabatically isolated. But in quantum statistical theory, a compression is not called adiabatic if it is rapid, even if the system is adiabatically isolated in the classical thermodynamic sense of the term. The words are used differently in the two disciplines, as stated just above.

Amide

An amide ( or or ), also known as an acid amide, is a compound with the <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a> RE(O)NR′ (R and R′ refer to <a href="hydrogen">H</a> or <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> groups). Most common are <a href="carboxamide">carboxamide</a>s (organic amides) ("n" = 1, E = C, "x" = 1), but many other important types of amides are known, including <a href="phosphoramide">phosphoramide</a>s ("n" = 2, E = P, "x" = 1 and many related formulas) and <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28chemistry%29">sulfonamide</a>s (E = S, "x" = 2). The term amide refers both to "classes of compounds" and to the "<a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>" (RE(O)NR′) within those compounds.

Amide can also refer to the <a href="conjugate%20base">conjugate base</a> of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (the <a href="amidogen">anion HN</a>) or of an organic <a href="amine">amine</a> (an anion RN). For discussion of these "<a href="anionic">anionic</a> amides", see <a href="Metal%20amides%23Alkali%20metal%20amides">Alkali metal amides</a>.

The remainder of this article is about the <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a>–<a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> sense of "amide".

The simplest amides are derivatives of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> wherein one hydrogen atom has been replaced by an <a href="acyl">acyl</a> group. The ensemble is generally represented as RC(O)NH and is described as a primary amide. Closely related and even more numerous are secondary amides which can be derived from <a href="primary%20amine">primary amine</a>s (R′NH) and have the formula RC(O)NHR′. Tertiary amides are commonly derived from <a href="secondary%20amine">secondary amine</a>s (R′R″NH) and have the general structure RC(O)NR′R″. Amides are usually regarded as derivatives of <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s in which the <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group has been replaced by an amine or ammonia.
The lone pair of <a href="electron">electron</a>s on the <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> is delocalized into the carbonyl, thus forming a partial <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a> between N and the <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> <a href="carbon">carbon</a>. Consequently, the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal. It is estimated that acetamide is described by <a href="resonance%20structure">resonance structure</a> A for 62% and by B for 28% (which does not sum to 100% because there are additional resonance forms that are not depicted in the above Figure).

In the usual nomenclature, one adds the term "amide" to the stem of the parent acid's name. For instance, the amide derived from <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> is named <a href="acetamide">acetamide</a> (CHCONH). IUPAC recommends <a href="ethanamide">ethanamide</a>, but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from <a href="dimethylamine">dimethylamine</a> and <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> is "N","N"-dimethylacetamide (CHCONMe, where Me = CH). Usually even this name is simplified to <a href="dimethylacetamide">dimethylacetamide</a>. Cyclic amides are called <a href="lactam">lactam</a>s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides. Functional groups consisting of –P(O)NR and –SONR are <a href="phosphonamides">phosphonamides</a> and <a href="sulfonamide%20%28chemistry%29">sulfonamide</a>s, respectively.

Some chemists make a pronunciation distinction between the two, saying for the <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a>–<a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> compound and for the <a href="anion">anion</a>. Others replace one of these with , while still others pronounce both , making them <a href="homonym">homonym</a>s.

Compared to <a href="amine">amine</a>s, amides are very weak <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>s. While the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate acid</a> of an <a href="amine">amine</a> has a <a href="pKa">p"K"</a> of about 9.5, the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate acid</a> of an amide has a p"K" around −0.5. Therefore, amides don't have as clearly noticeable <a href="acid%E2%80%93base">acid–base</a> properties in <a href="water">water</a>. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the <a href="electron">electron</a>-withdrawing nature of the <a href="carbonyl%20group">carbonyl group</a> where the lone pair of <a href="electron">electron</a>s on the <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> is delocalized by <a href="resonance%20%28chemistry%29">resonance</a>. On the other hand, amides are much stronger <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>s than <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s, <a href="ester">ester</a>s, <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s, and <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s (their conjugate acids' p"K"s are between −6 and −10). It is estimated <a href="in%20silico">in silico</a> that <a href="acetamide">acetamide</a> is represented by <a href="resonance%20structure">resonance structure</a> A for 62% and by B for 28%. Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained <a href="quinuclidone">quinuclidone</a>.

Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N–C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N–C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N–H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N–H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.

The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p"K" is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> can become protonated with a p"K" of roughly −1.

The <a href="Solubility">solubilities</a> of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of <a href="Dimethylformamide">"N","N"-dimethylformamide</a>, exhibit low solubility in water.

The presence of the functional group is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. They are the most common non-basic functional group. They can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups by their <a href="IR%20spectroscopy">IR spectra</a>. Amides exhibit a moderately intense "ν" band near 1650 cm. By H <a href="NMR%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a>, CONHR signals occur at low fields. In X-ray crystallography, the C(O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane.

Amides are pervasive in nature and technology as structural materials. The amide linkage is easily formed, confers structural rigidity, and resists <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>. <a href="Nylon">Nylon</a>s are <a href="polyamide">polyamide</a>s, as are the very resilient materials <a href="Aramid">Aramid</a>, <a href="Twaron">Twaron</a>, and <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a>. Amide linkages constitute a defining molecular feature of <a href="protein">protein</a>s, the <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> of which is due in part to the <a href="hydrogen%20bonding">hydrogen bonding</a> abilities of amides. Amide linkages in a <a href="biochemistry">biochemical</a> context are called <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s when they occur in the main chain of a protein and <a href="isopeptide%20bond">isopeptide bond</a>s when they occur to a side-chain of the protein. Proteins can have structural roles, such as in <a href="hair">hair</a> or <a href="spider%20silk">spider silk</a>, but also nearly all <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s are proteins. Low molecular weight amides, such as <a href="dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a> (HC(O)N(CH)), are common solvents. Many drugs are amides, including <a href="paracetamol">paracetamol</a>, <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> and <a href="LSD">LSD</a>. Moreover, plant "N"-alkylamides have a wide range of biological functionalities.

Many methods exist in amide synthesis. On paper, the simplest method for making amides is by coupling a <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> with an <a href="amine">amine</a>. In general this reaction is thermodynamically favorable, however it suffers from a high <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a>, largely due to the amine first deprotonating the carboxylic acid, which reduces its reactivity. As such the direct reaction often requires high temperatures.

Many methods are known for driving the equilibrium to the right. For the most part these reactions involve "activating" the carboxylic acid by first converting it to a better <a href="electrophile">electrophile</a>; such as <a href="ester">ester</a>s, <a href="acid%20chloride">acid chloride</a>s (<a href="Schotten-Baumann%20reaction">Schotten-Baumann reaction</a>) or <a href="anhydride">anhydride</a>s (<a href="Lumi%C3%A8re%E2%80%93Barbier%20method">Lumière–Barbier method</a>). Conventional methods in <a href="peptide%20synthesis">peptide synthesis</a> use coupling agents such as <a href="HATU">HATU</a>, <a href="Hydroxybenzotriazole">HOBt</a>, or <a href="PyBOP">PyBOP</a>. In recent years there has also been a surge in the development of Boron-based reagents for amide bond formation, including catalytic use of 2-IodoPhenylBoronic acid or MIBA, and stoichiometric use of <a href="Tris%282%2C2%2C2-trifluoroethyl%29%20borate">Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) borate</a>.

The seemingly simple direct reaction between an <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> and an <a href="amine">amine</a> to an amide was not tried until 2007 when a special <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a>-based <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> was reported to be effective in a so-called dehydrogenative acylation:

The generation of hydrogen gas compensates for unfavorable thermodynamics. The reaction is believed to proceed by one dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a> followed by formation of a <a href="hemiaminal">hemiaminal</a> and the after a second dehydrogenation to the amide. Elimination of water in the hemiaminal to the imine is not observed.

A direct generation of amide from aryl (heteroaryl) alkyl ketones has been accomplished via copper(II) catalyzed
C-C bond cleavage in the presence of diisopropylamine at moderate temperature. The transformation steps for
amide formation comprise catalytic generation of α-bromo carbonyl species followed by nucleophilic displacement
of bromide with sodium azide in the presence of diisopropylamine. The final step involves the formation of imine
by heating in situ followed by hydrolysis to give the related amide.

Amides undergo many chemical reactions, although they are less reactive than esters. Amides hydrolyse in hot <a href="alkali">alkali</a> as well as in strong <a href="acid">acid</a>ic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia. Amides are also versatile precursors to many other <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s.Electrophiles attack the <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> oxygen. This step often precedes hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by both <a href="Bronsted%20acid">Bronsted acid</a>s and <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>s. Enzymes, e.g. <a href="peptidase">peptidase</a>s and artificial catalysts, are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions.

Animism

Animism (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "", "<a href="breath">breath</a>, <a href="Soul">spirit</a>, <a href="life">life</a>") is the <a href="religious%20belief">religious belief</a> that objects, places and creatures all possess a distinct spiritual essence. Potentially, animism perceives all things—animals, plants, rocks, rivers, weather systems, human handiwork and perhaps even words—as animated and alive. 

Animism is the oldest known type of belief system in the world that even predates <a href="paganism">paganism</a>. It is still practiced in a variety of forms in many traditional societies. Animism is used in the <a href="anthropology%20of%20religion">anthropology of religion</a> as a term for the belief system of many <a href="indigenous%20people">indigenous tribal peoples</a>, especially in contrast to the relatively more recent development of <a href="Organised%20religion">organised religions</a>. Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, "animism" is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples' "spiritual" or "supernatural" perspectives. The animistic perspective is so widely held and inherent to most animistic indigenous peoples that they often do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to "animism" (or even "religion"); the term is an <a href="Emic%20and%20etic">anthropological construct</a>.

Largely due to such <a href="ethnolinguistic">ethnolinguistic</a> and cultural discrepancies, opinion has differed on whether "animism" refers to an ancestral mode of experience common to indigenous peoples around the world, or to a full-fledged religion in its own right. The currently accepted definition of animism was only developed in the late 19th century by Sir <a href="Edward%20Tylor">Edward Tylor</a>, who created it as "one of <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>'s earliest concepts, if not the first".

Animism encompasses the beliefs that all material phenomena have agency, that there exists no hard and fast distinction between the <a href="Spirituality">spiritual</a> and physical (or material) world and that <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a> or <a href="spirit">spirit</a> or sentience exists not only in humans, but also in other animals, plants, rocks, geographic features such as mountains or rivers or other entities of the natural environment, including thunder, wind and shadows. Animism thus rejects <a href="Cartesian%20dualism">Cartesian dualism</a>. Animism may further attribute souls to abstract concepts such as words, <a href="true%20name">true name</a>s or metaphors in <a href="mythology">mythology</a>. Some members of the non-tribal world also consider themselves animists (such as author <a href="Daniel%20Quinn">Daniel Quinn</a>, sculptor <a href="Lawson%20Oyekan">Lawson Oyekan</a> and many contemporary <a href="Modern%20Paganism">Pagans</a>).

Earlier anthropological perspectives – since termed the "old animism" – were concerned with knowledge surrounding what is alive and what factors make something alive. The "old animism" assumed that animists were individuals who were unable to understand the difference between <a href="persons">persons</a> and <a href="Object%20%28philosophy%29">things</a>.
Critics of the "old animism" have accused it of preserving "colonialist and dualist worldviews and rhetoric".

The idea of animism was developed by the <a href="anthropology">anthropologist</a> <a href="Edward%20Burnett%20Tylor">Sir Edward Tylor</a> in his 1871 book "Primitive Culture", in which he defined it as "the general doctrine of souls and other spiritual beings in general." According to Tylor, animism often includes "an idea of pervading life and will in nature"; i.e., a belief that natural objects other than humans have souls. This formulation was little different from that proposed by <a href="Auguste%20Comte">Auguste Comte</a> as "<a href="fetishism">fetishism</a>", although the terms now have distinct meanings.

For Tylor, animism represented the earliest form of religion, being situated within an evolutionary framework of religion which has developed in stages and which will ultimately lead to humanity rejecting religion altogether in favor of scientific rationality.
Thus, for Tylor, animism was fundamentally seen as a mistake, a basic error from which all religion grew. He did not believe that animism was inherently illogical, but suggested that it arose from early humans' dreams and visions, and thus while being a rational system, it was based on erroneous, un-scientific observations about the nature of reality. Stringer notes that his reading of "Primitive Culture" led him to believe that Tylor was far more sympathetic in regard to “primitive” populations than many of his contemporaries, and that Tylor expressed no belief that there was any difference between the intellectual capabilities of “savage” people and Westerners.

Tylor had initially wanted to describe this phenomenon as "spiritualism," however he decided against this upon recognizing that it would cause confusion with the modern religion of <a href="Spiritualism">Spiritualism</a> which was prevalent across Western nations during his own time. He adopted the term "animism" from the writings of the German scientist <a href="Georg%20Ernst%20Stahl">Georg Ernst Stahl</a>, who, in 1708, had developed the term "" as a <a href="biology">biological</a> theory that <a href="soul%20%28spirit%29">souls</a> formed the <a href="vital%20principle">vital principle</a> and that the normal phenomena of life and the abnormal phenomena of disease could be traced to spiritual causes. The earliest known usage in English appeared in 1819.

The idea that there had once been "one universal form of primitive religion" – whether labelled "animism", "totemism", or "shamanism" – has been dismissed as "unsophisticated" and "erroneous" by the archaeologist <a href="Timothy%20Insoll">Timothy Insoll</a>, who stated that "it removes complexity, a precondition of religion now, in "all" its variants".

Tylor's definition of animism was a part of a growing international debate on the nature of 'primitive society' by lawyers, theologians, and philologists. The debate defined the field of research of a new science – anthropology. By the end of the nineteenth century, an orthodoxy on 'primitive society' had emerged, although few anthropologists today would accept their definition; the 'nineteenth century armchair anthropologists' argued 'primitive society' (an evolutionary category) was ordered by kinship and was divided into exogamous <a href="Kinship">descent groups</a> related by a series of marriage exchanges. Their religion was animism – the belief that natural species and objects had souls. With the development of private property, these descent groups were displaced by the emergence of the territorial state. These rituals and beliefs eventually evolved over time into the vast array of "developed" religions. According to Tylor, the more scientifically advanced a society became, the fewer members of that society believed in animism; however, any remnant ideologies of souls or spirits, to Tylor, represented "survivals" of the original animism of early humanity.

In 1869 (three years after Tylor proposed his definition of animism), the Edinburgh lawyer, John Ferguson McLellan, argued that the animistic thinking evident in <a href="fetishism">fetishism</a> gave rise to a religion he named <a href="Totemism">Totemism</a>. Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended of the same species as their totemic animal. Subsequent debate by the 'armchair anthropologists' (including <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20Bachofen">J. J. Bachofen</a>, <a href="%C3%89mile%20Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> and <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>) remained focused on <a href="totemism">totemism</a> rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Indeed, anthropologists "have commonly avoided the issue of Animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich <a href="ethnographies">ethnographies</a>."

According to the anthropologist <a href="Tim%20Ingold">Tim Ingold</a>, animism shares similarities to totemism but differs in its focus on individual spirit beings which help to perpetuate life, whereas totemism more typically holds that there is a primary source, such as the land itself or the ancestors, who provide the basis to life. Certain indigenous religious groups such as the <a href="Australian%20Aboriginals">Australian Aboriginals</a> are more typically totemic, whereas others like the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> are more typically animistic in their worldview.

From his studies into child development, <a href="Jean%20Piaget">Jean Piaget</a> suggested that children were born with an innate animist worldview in which they anthropomorphized inanimate objects, and that it was only later that they grew out of this belief. Conversely, from her ethnographic research, <a href="Margaret%20Mead">Margaret Mead</a> argued the opposite, believing that children were not born with an animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.
Stewart Guthrie saw animism – or "attribution" as he preferred it – as an evolutionary strategy to aid survival. He argued that both humans and other animal species view inanimate objects as potentially alive as a means of being constantly on guard against potential threats. His suggested explanation, however, did not deal with the question of why such a belief became central to religion.

In 2000, Guthrie suggested that the "most widespread" concept of animism was that it was the "attribution of spirits to natural phenomena
such as stones and trees".

Many anthropologists ceased using the term "animism", deeming it to be too close to early anthropological theory and religious polemic. However, the term had also been claimed by religious groups – namely indigenous communities and <a href="nature%20worship">nature worship</a>ers – who felt that it aptly described their own beliefs, and who in some cases actively identified as "animists". It was thus readopted by various scholars, however they began using the term in a different way, placing the focus on knowing how to behave toward other persons, some of whom aren't human. As the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated, while the "old animist" definition had been problematic, the term "animism" was nevertheless "of considerable value as a critical, academic term for a style of religious and cultural relating to the world."
The "new animism" emerged largely from the publications of the anthropologist <a href="Alfred%20Irving%20Hallowell">Irving Hallowell</a> which were produced on the basis of his ethnographic research among the <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> communities of Canada in the mid-20th century. For the Ojibwe encountered by Hallowell, "<a href="personhood">personhood</a>" did not require human-likeness, but rather humans were perceived as being like other persons, who for instance included rock persons and bear persons. For the Ojibwe, these persons were each wilful beings who gained meaning and power through their interactions with others; through respectfully interacting with other persons, they themselves learned to "act as a person". Hallowell's approach to the understanding of Ojibwe personhood differed strongly from prior anthropological concepts of animism. He emphasized the need to challenge the modernist, Western perspectives of what a person is by entering into a dialogue with different worldwide-views.

Hallowell's approach influenced the work of anthropologist Nurit Bird-David, who produced a <a href="Academic%20journal%23Scholarly%20articles">scholarly article</a> reassessing the idea of animism in 1999. Seven comments from other academics were provided in the journal, debating Bird-David's ideas.

More recently post-modern anthropologists are increasingly engaging with the concept of animism. Modernism is characterized by a Cartesian subject-object dualism that divides the subjective from the objective, and culture from nature; in this view, Animism is the inverse of <a href="scientism">scientism</a>, and hence inherently invalid. Drawing on the work of <a href="Bruno%20Latour">Bruno Latour</a>, these anthropologists question these modernist assumptions, and theorize that all societies continue to "animate" the world around them, and not just as a Tylorian survival of primitive thought. Rather, the instrumental reason characteristic of modernity is limited to our "professional subcultures," which allows us to treat the world as a detached mechanical object in a delimited sphere of activity. We, like animists, also continue to create personal relationships with elements of the so-called objective world, whether pets, cars or teddy-bears, who we recognize as subjects. As such, these entities are "approached as communicative subjects rather than the inert objects perceived by modernists." These approaches are careful to avoid the modernist assumptions that the environment consists dichotomously of a physical world distinct from humans, and from modernist conceptions of the person as composed dualistically as body and soul.

Nurit Bird-David argues that "Positivistic ideas about the meaning of 'nature', 'life' and 'personhood' misdirected these previous attempts to understand the local concepts. Classical theoreticians (it is argued) attributed their own modernist ideas of self to 'primitive peoples' while asserting that the 'primitive peoples' read their idea of self into others!" She argues that animism is a "relational epistemology", and not a Tylorian failure of primitive reasoning. That is, self-identity among animists is based on their relationships with others, rather than some distinctive feature of the self. Instead of focusing on the essentialized, modernist self (the "individual"), persons are viewed as bundles of social relationships ("dividuals"), some of which are with "superpersons" (i.e. non-humans).

Guthrie expressed criticism of Bird-David's attitude toward animism, believing that it promulgated the view that "the world is in large measure whatever our local imagination makes it". This, he felt, would result in anthropology abandoning "the scientific project".

Tim Ingold, like Bird-David, argues that animists do not see themselves as separate from their environment: "Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an external world of nature that has to be 'grasped' intellectually ... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their thought and practice." Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this <a href="Cartesian%20dualism">Cartesian dualism</a>, and that the animist self identifies with the world, "feeling at once "within" and "apart" from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit." The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it. <a href="Shamanism">Shamanism</a>, in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.

Cultural ecologist and philosopher <a href="David%20Abram">David Abram</a> articulates and elaborates an intensely ethical and ecological form of animism grounded in the <a href="Phenomenology%20%28psychology%29">phenomenology</a> of sensory experience. In his books "Becoming Animal" and "The Spell of the Sensuous," Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain, enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us. In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as we turn our gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us—we 'see what they say'—much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. "To tell the story in this manner—to provide an animistic account of reason, rather than the other way around—is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it." 

The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey defined animism as the belief "that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others". He added that it is therefore "concerned with learning how to be a good person in respectful relationships with other persons".
Graham Harvey, in his 2013 Handbook of Contemporary Animism, identifies the animist perspective in line with Martin Buber's "I-thou" as opposed to "I-it". In such, Harvey says, the Animist takes an I-thou approach to relating to his world, where objects and animals are treated as a "thou" rather than as an "it".

There is ongoing disagreement (and no general consensus) as to whether animism is merely a singular, broadly encompassing religious belief or a worldview in and of itself, comprising many diverse mythologies found worldwide in many diverse cultures. This also raises a controversy regarding the ethical claims animism may or may not make: whether animism ignores questions of <a href="ethics">ethics</a> altogether or, by endowing various non-human elements of nature with spirituality or personhood, in fact promotes a complex <a href="Environmental%20ethics">ecological ethics</a>.

In many animistic world views, the human being is often regarded as on a roughly equal footing with other animals, plants, and natural forces.

A shaman is a person regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of <a href="Evocation">benevolent and malevolent spirits</a>, who typically enters into a <a href="trance">trance</a> state during a <a href="ritual">ritual</a>, and practices <a href="divination">divination</a> and <a href="healing">healing</a>. According to Mircea Eliade, shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters <a href="otherworld">supernatural realms</a> or <a href="Plane%20%28esotericism%29">dimensions</a> to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment. Abram, however, articulates a less supernatural and much more ecological understanding of the shaman's role than that propounded by Eliade. Drawing upon his own field research in Indonesia, Nepal, and the Americas, Abram suggests that in animistic cultures, the shaman functions primarily as an intermediary between the human community and the more-than-human community of active agencies — the local animals, plants, and landforms (mountains, rivers, forests, winds and weather patterns, all of whom are felt to have their own specific sentience). Hence the shaman's ability to heal individual instances of dis-ease (or imbalance) within the human community is a by-product of her/his more continual practice of balancing the reciprocity between the human community and the wider collective of animate beings in which that community is embedded. 

Animism is not the same as <a href="pantheism">pantheism</a>, although the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.


Animism entails the belief that "all living things have a soul", and thus a central concern of animist thought surrounds how animals can be eaten or otherwise used for humans' subsistence needs. The actions of non-human animals are viewed as "intentional, planned and purposive", and they are understood to be persons because they are both alive and communicate with others. In animist world-views, non-human animals are understood to participate in <a href="kinship">kinship</a> systems and ceremonies with humans, as well as having their own kinship systems and ceremonies. Harvey cited an example of an animist understanding of animal behaviour that occurred at a <a href="powwow">powwow</a> held by the <a href="Conne%20River">Conne River</a> <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> in 1996; an eagle flew over the proceedings, circling over the central drum group. The assembled participants called out "kitpu" ("eagle"), conveying welcome to the bird and expressing pleasure at its beauty, and they later articulated the view that the eagle's actions reflected its approval of the event and the Mi'kmaq's return to traditional spiritual practices.

Some animists also view plant and fungi life as persons and interact with them accordingly. The most common encounter between humans and these plant and fungi persons is with the former's collection of the latter for food, and for animists this interaction typically has to be carried out respectfully. Harvey cited the example of Maori communities in New Zealand, who often offer "<a href="karakia">karakia</a>" invocations to <a href="sweet%20potatoes">sweet potatoes</a> as they dig the latter up; while doing so there is an awareness of a kinship relationship between the Maori and the sweet potatoes, with both understood as having arrived in <a href="Aotearoa">Aotearoa</a> together in the same canoes. In other instances, animists believe that interaction with plant and fungi persons can result in the communication of things unknown or even otherwise unknowable. Among some modern Pagans, for instance, relationships are cultivated with specific trees, who are understood to bestow knowledge or physical gifts, such as flowers, sap, or wood that can be used as firewood or to fashion into a <a href="wand">wand</a>; in return, these Pagans give offerings to the tree itself, which can come in the form of <a href="libation">libation</a>s of mead or ale, a drop of blood from a finger, or a strand of wool.

Various animistic cultures also comprehend as stones as persons. Discussing ethnographic work conducted among the Ojibwe, Harvey noted that their society generally conceived of stones as being inanimate, but with two notable exceptions: the stones of the <a href="Bell%20Rocks">Bell Rocks</a> and those stones which are situated beneath trees struck by lightning, which were understood to have become Thunderers themselves. The Ojibwe conceived of weather as being capable of having personhood, with storms being conceived of as persons known as 'Thunderers' whose sounds conveyed communications and who engaged in seasonal conflict over the lakes and forests, throwing lightning at lake monsters. Wind, similarly, can be conceived as a person in animistic thought.

The importance of place is also a recurring element of animism, with some places being understood to be persons in their own right.

Animism can also entail relationships being established with non-corporeal <a href="spirit">spirit</a> entities.

In the early 20th century, <a href="William%20McDougall%20%28psychologist%29">William McDougall</a> defended a form of Animism in his book "Body and Mind: A History and Defence of Animism" (1911).

The physicist <a href="Nick%20Herbert%20%28physicist%29">Nick Herbert</a> has argued for "quantum animism" in which mind permeates the world at every level.
<a href="Werner%20Krieglstein">Werner Krieglstein</a> wrote regarding his quantum Animism:

Harvey opined that animism's views on personhood represented a radical challenge to the dominant perspectives of <a href="modernity">modernity</a>, because it accords "intelligence, rationality, consciousness, volition, agency, intentionality, language and desire" to non-humans. Similarly, it challenges the view of human uniqueness that is prevalent in both <a href="Abrahamic%20religion">Abrahamic religion</a>s and Western <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a>.

Animist beliefs can also be expressed through artwork. For instance, among the Maori communities of New Zealand, there is an acknowledgment that creating art through carving wood or stone entails violence against the wood or stone person, and that the persons who are damaged therefore have to be placated and respected during the process; any excess or waste from the creation of the artwork is returned to the land, while the artwork itself is treated with particular respect. Harvey therefore argued that the creation of art among the Maori was not about creating an inanimate object for display, but rather a transformation of different persons within a relationship.

Harvey expressed the view that animist worldviews were present in various works of literature, citing such examples as the writings of <a href="Alan%20Garner">Alan Garner</a>, <a href="Leslie%20Silko">Leslie Silko</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Kingsolver">Barbara Kingsolver</a>, <a href="Alice%20Walker">Alice Walker</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Quinn">Daniel Quinn</a>, <a href="Linda%20Hogan">Linda Hogan</a>, <a href="David%20Abram">David Abram</a>, <a href="Patricia%20Grace">Patricia Grace</a>, <a href="Chinua%20Achebe">Chinua Achebe</a>, <a href="Ursula%20Le%20Guin">Ursula Le Guin</a>, <a href="Louise%20Erdrich">Louise Erdrich</a>, and <a href="Marge%20Piercy">Marge Piercy</a>.

Antonio Vivaldi

Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (; 4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was an <a href="Italians">Italian</a> <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> composer, <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> violinist, teacher and <a href="Clergy">cleric</a>. Born in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental <a href="concerto">concerto</a>s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty <a href="opera">opera</a>s. His best-known work is a series of <a href="violin%20concerto">violin concerto</a>s known as "<a href="The%20Four%20Seasons%20%28Vivaldi%29">The Four Seasons</a>".

Many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the "<a href="Ospedale%20della%20Piet%C3%A0">Ospedale della Pietà</a>", a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi (who had been ordained as a <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Catholic priest</a>) was employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. After meeting the <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Charles VI</a>, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later in poverty.

Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on 4 March 1678 in Venice, then the capital of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a>. He was <a href="Baptism">baptized</a> immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though not known for certain, the child's immediate baptism was most likely due either to his poor health or to an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> that shook the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood. Vivaldi's official church baptism took place two months later.

Vivaldi's parents were Giovanni Battista Vivaldi and Camilla Calicchio, as recorded in the register of <a href="San%20Giovanni%20in%20Bragora">San Giovanni in Bragora</a>. Vivaldi had eight siblings: Iseppo Santo Vivaldi, Iseppo Gaetano Vivaldi, Bonaventura Tomaso Vivaldi, Margarita Gabriela Vivaldi, Cecilia Maria Vivaldi , Gerolama Michela Vivaldi, Francesco Gaetano Vivaldi, and Zanetta Anna Vivaldi. Giovanni Battista, who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà. Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the "Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia", an association of musicians.

The president of the "Sovvegno" was <a href="Giovanni%20Legrenzi">Giovanni Legrenzi</a>, an early Baroque composer and the "maestro di cappella" at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a>. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work "Laetatus sum" (<a href="Ryom-Verzeichnis">RV</a> Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled "La Fedeltà sfortunata" was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi—the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.

Vivaldi's health was problematic. His symptoms, "strettezza di petto" ("tightness of the chest"), have been interpreted as a form of <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing or taking part in musical activities, although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. In 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">priest</a>. He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed "il Prete Rosso", "The Red Priest". ("" is Italian for "red", and would have referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.)

Not long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> because of his ill health. Vivaldi only said Mass as a priest a few times and appeared to have withdrawn from priestly duties, though he remained a priest.

In September 1703, Vivaldi became "maestro di violino" (master of violin) at an <a href="orphanage">orphanage</a> called the Pio <a href="Ospedale%20della%20Piet%C3%A0">Ospedale della Pietà</a> (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice. While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as "the famous composer and violinist" and said that "Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion."
Vivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the Ospedale della Pietà. Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there. There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them. They were financed by funds provided by the Republic. The boys learned a trade and had to leave when they reached 15. The girls received a musical education, and the most talented stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.

Shortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them. These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra. In 1704, the position of teacher of "<a href="lyra%20viol">viola all'inglese</a>" was added to his duties as violin instructor. The position of "maestro di coro", which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work. He had to compose an oratorio or concerto at every feast and teach the orphans both music theory and how to play certain instruments.

His relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous, and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709. After a year as a freelance musician, he was recalled by the Ospedale with a unanimous vote in 1711; clearly during his year's absence the board had realized the importance of his role. He became responsible for all of the musical activity of the institution when he was promoted to "maestro de' concerti" (music director) in 1716.

In 1705, the first collection ("Connor Cassara") of his works was published by Giuseppe Sala: his Opus 1 is a collection of 12 <a href="sonata">sonata</a>s for two violins and basso continuo, in a conventional style. In 1709, a second collection of 12 sonatas for violin and basso continuo appeared, his Opus 2. A real breakthrough as a composer came with his first collection of 12 concerti for one, two, and four violins with strings, "<a href="L%27estro%20Armonico">L'estro armonico</a>" Opus 3, which was published in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1711 by <a href="Estienne%20Roger">Estienne Roger</a>, dedicated to <a href="Ferdinando%20%28III%29%20de%27%20Medici">Grand Prince Ferdinand of Tuscany</a>. The prince sponsored many musicians including <a href="Alessandro%20Scarlatti">Alessandro Scarlatti</a> and <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>. He was a musician himself, and Vivaldi probably met him in Venice. "L'estro armonico" was a resounding success all over Europe. It was followed in 1714 by "<a href="La%20stravaganza">La stravaganza</a>" Opus 4, a collection of concerti for solo violin and strings, dedicated to an old violin student of Vivaldi's, the Venetian noble Vettor Dolfin.

In February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>, where his setting of the <a href="Stabat%20Mater">Stabat Mater</a> (<a href="Stabat%20Mater%20%28Vivaldi%29">RV 621</a>) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is one of his early masterpieces.

Despite his frequent travels from 1718, the Pietà paid him 2 <a href="sequin%20%28coin%29">sequins</a> to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The Pietà's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.

In early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, "<a href="Ottone%20in%20villa">Ottone in villa</a>" (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a> in 1713. The following year, Vivaldi became the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> of the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Angelo">Teatro San Angelo</a> in Venice, where his opera "<a href="Orlando%20finto%20pazzo">Orlando finto pazzo</a>" (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.

In 1715, he presented "<a href="Nerone%20fatto%20Cesare">Nerone fatto Cesare</a>" (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven <a href="aria">aria</a>s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera composed entirely by him, "<a href="Arsilda%2C%20regina%20di%20Ponto">Arsilda, regina di Ponto</a>" (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man. Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.

At this period, the "Pietà" commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s. "Moyses Deus Pharaonis", (RV 643) is lost. The second, "<a href="Juditha%20triumphans">Juditha triumphans</a>" (RV 644), celebrates the <a href="Siege%20of%20Corfu%20%281716%29">victory of the Republic of Venice</a> against the Turks and the recapture of the island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the Pietà, both the female and male roles. Many of the <a href="aria">aria</a>s include parts for solo instruments—recorders, oboes, violas d'amore, and mandolins—that showcased the range of talents of the girls.

Also in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Dario">L'incoronazione di Dario</a>" (RV 719) and "La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi" (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled "Artabano re dei Parti" (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the following years, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.
His progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians, like <a href="Benedetto%20Marcello">Benedetto Marcello</a>, a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> denouncing him and his operas. The pamphlet, "<a href="Il%20teatro%20alla%20moda">Il teatro alla moda</a>", attacks Vivaldi without mentioning him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure writing under the picture mentions non-existent places and names: "ALDIVIVA" is an anagram of "A. Vivaldi".

In a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his "94 operas". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have exaggerated, in his dual role of composer and "impresario" it is plausible that he may either have written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas during a career which by then had spanned almost 25 years. While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never reached the prominence of other great composers like <a href="Alessandro%20Scarlatti">Alessandro Scarlatti</a>, <a href="Johann%20Adolph%20Hasse">Johann Adolph Hasse</a>, <a href="Leonardo%20Leo">Leonardo Leo</a>, and <a href="Baldassare%20Galuppi">Baldassare Galuppi</a>, as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for any extended period of time in any major opera house.

In 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a new prestigious position as "Maestro di Cappella" of the court of prince <a href="Philip%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt">Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt</a>, governor of <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>. He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among which was "<a href="Tito%20Manlio">Tito Manlio</a>" (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama "<a href="La%20Silvia">La Silvia</a>" (RV 734, 9 arias survive). He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio "L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù" (RV 645, also lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new <a href="pope%20Benedict%20XIII">pope Benedict XIII</a> invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.
During this period Vivaldi wrote the "<a href="The%20Four%20Seasons%20%28Vivaldi%29">Four Seasons</a>", four violin concertos depicting scenes appropriate for each season. Three of the concerti are of original conception, while the first, "Spring", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of his contemporaneous opera "Il Giustino". The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a <a href="sonnet">sonnet</a>, possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, "<a href="Il%20cimento%20dell%27armonia%20e%20dell%27inventione">Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione</a>", Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by <a href="Michel-Charles%20Le%20C%C3%A8ne">Michel-Charles Le Cène</a> in 1725.

During his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer <a href="Anna%20Gir%C3%B2">Anna Tessieri Girò</a> who was to become his student, protégée, and favorite prima donna. Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, became part of Vivaldi's entourage and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation about the nature of Vivaldi's and Giro's relationship, but no evidence to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Although Vivaldi's relationship with Anna Girò was questioned, he adamantly denied any romantic relationship in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.

At the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The "serenata" (cantata) "Gloria e Imeneo" (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a> to Venice in celebration of the marriage of <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV</a>. The following year, another "serenata", "La Sena festeggiante" (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, <a href="Princess%20Henriette%20of%20France">Henriette</a> and <a href="Louise%20%C3%89lisabeth%20of%20France">Louise Élisabeth</a>. Vivaldi's Opus 9, "<a href="La%20cetra%20%28Vivaldi%29">La cetra</a>", was dedicated to <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles VI</a>. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of <a href="knight">knight</a>, a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of "La cetra", a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.

Accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera "<a href="Farnace">Farnace</a>" (RV 711) was presented. "Farnace" garnered six revivals later. Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. "<a href="L%27Olimpiade">L'Olimpiade</a>" and "<a href="Catone%20in%20Utica">Catone in Utica</a>" were written by <a href="Pietro%20Metastasio">Pietro Metastasio</a>, the major representative of the <a href="Academy%20of%20Arcadia">Arcadian</a> movement and court poet in Vienna. "<a href="Griselda%20%28Vivaldi%29">La Griselda</a>" was rewritten by the young <a href="Carlo%20Goldoni">Carlo Goldoni</a> from an earlier libretto by <a href="Apostolo%20Zeno">Apostolo Zeno</a>.

Like many composers of the time, the final years of Vivaldi's life found him in financial difficulties. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once were in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Girò.

It is also likely that Vivaldi went to Vienna to stage operas, especially as he took up residence near the <a href="K%C3%A4rntnertortheater">Kärntnertortheater</a>. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished and died during the night of 27/28 July 1741, aged 63, of "internal infection", in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker. On 28 July he was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund. Vivaldi's funeral took place at <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>, but contrary to popular legend, the young <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> had nothing to do with this burial, since no music was performed on that occasion. The cost of his funeral with a 'Kleingeläut' was 19 Gulden 45 Kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells.

He was buried next to <a href="Karlskirche">Karlskirche</a>, in an area which is now part of the site of the <a href="Vienna%20University%20of%20Technology">Technical Institute</a>. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the <a href="Hotel%20Sacher">Hotel Sacher</a> is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi "star" in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.

Only two, possibly three original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced at some later time by other artists, was made in 1725 by François Morellon La Cave for the first edition of "<a href="Il%20cimento%20dell%27armonia%20e%20dell%27inventione">Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione</a>", and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music. The ink sketch, a <a href="caricature">caricature</a>, was done by <a href="Pier%20Leone%20Ghezzi">Ghezzi</a> in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican Library</a>, and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow. The oil painting, which can be seen in the <a href="International%20Museum%20and%20Library%20of%20Music%20of%20Bologna">International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna</a>, is anonymous, and is thought to be of Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the La Cave engraving.

Vivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes; many of his compositions are flamboyantly, almost playfully, exuberant.

<a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his "<a href="St%20John%20Passion">St John Passion</a>", "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>", and <a href="Bach%20cantata">cantatas</a>). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and <a href="Figured%20bass">basso continuo</a> (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo (<a href="Ryom-Verzeichnis">RV</a> 580).

During his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries, including France, but after his death the composer's popularity dwindled. After the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown and were largely ignored. Even Vivaldi's most famous work, "The Four Seasons", was unknown in its original edition during the <a href="Classical%20period%20%28music%29">Classical</a> and <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic</a> periods.

During the early 20th century, <a href="Fritz%20Kreisler">Fritz Kreisler</a>'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar <a href="Marc%20Pincherle">Marc Pincherle</a> to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the <a href="Turin%20National%20University%20Library">Turin National University Library</a> as a result of the generous sponsorship of <a href="Turin">Turin</a>ese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, <a href="Alfredo%20Casella">Alfredo Casella</a>, <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="Olga%20Rudge">Olga Rudge</a>, <a href="Desmond%20Chute">Desmond Chute</a>, <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schering">Arnold Schering</a> and <a href="Louis%20Kaufman">Louis Kaufman</a>, all of whom were instrumental in the Vivaldi revival of the 20th century.

In 1926, in a monastery in <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>, researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.

The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of <a href="Alfredo%20Casella">Alfredo Casella</a>, who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered <a href="Gloria%20%28Vivaldi%29">Gloria</a> (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. <a href="Historically%20informed%20performance">Historically informed performance</a>s, often on "original instruments", have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.

Recent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two <a href="psalm">psalm</a> settings of "Nisi Dominus" (RV 803, in eight movements) and "Dixit Dominus" (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar <a href="Michael%20Talbot%20%28musicologist%29">Michael Talbot</a> described RV 807 as "arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since... ...the 1920s". Vivaldi's lost 1730 opera "<a href="Argippo">Argippo</a>" (RV 697) was rediscovered in 2006 by the <a href="harpsichordist">harpsichordist</a> and conductor Ondřej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at <a href="Prague%20Castle">Prague Castle</a> on 3 May 2008, its first performance since 1730.

A composition by Vivaldi is identified by <a href="Ryom-Verzeichnis">RV number</a>, which refers to its place in the "Ryom-Verzeichnis" or "Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi", a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist <a href="Peter%20Ryom">Peter Ryom</a>.

<a href="The%20Four%20Seasons%20%28Vivaldi%29">"Le quattro stagioni" (The Four Seasons)</a> of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of "<a href="Il%20cimento%20dell%27armonia%20e%20dell%27inventione">Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione</a>" ("The Contest between Harmony and Invention"), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th century <a href="program%20music">program music</a>.

Vivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>, <a href="cello">cello</a>, <a href="oboe">oboe</a>, <a href="flute">flute</a>, <a href="viola%20d%27amore">viola d'amore</a>, <a href="Recorder%20%28musical%20instrument%29">recorder</a>, <a href="lute">lute</a>, or <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.

As well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music. Other works include <a href="sinfonia">sinfonia</a>s, about 90 <a href="sonata">sonata</a>s and chamber music.

Some sonatas for flute, published as "Il Pastor Fido", have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by <a href="Nicolas%20Ch%C3%A9deville">Nicolas Chédeville</a>.

Vivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned <a href="Ryom-Verzeichnis">here</a>).

Because the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, Fanna numbers were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B major, "La Notte" RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1

Despite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older <a href="Marc%20Pincherle">Pincherle</a> numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.

This cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where <a href="Gian%20Francesco%20Malipiero">Gian Francesco Malipiero</a> was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.

Compositions by Vivaldi are identified today by <a href="Ryom-Verzeichnis">RV number</a>, the number assigned by Danish musicologist <a href="Peter%20Ryom">Peter Ryom</a> in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the "Ryom-Verzeichnis" or "Répertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi". Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to "adjacent" works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works. These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at <a href="http%3A//www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php">classical.net</a>.

The movie "" was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of <a href="Jean-Louis%20Guillermou">Jean-Louis Guillermou</a>. In 2005, <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">ABC</a> <a href="Radio%20National">Radio National</a> commissioned a <a href="radio%20play">radio play</a> about Vivaldi, which was written by <a href="Sean%20Riley%20%28playwright%29">Sean Riley</a>. Entitled "The Angel and the Red Priest", the play was later adapted for the stage and was performed at the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20of%20the%20Arts">Adelaide Festival of the Arts</a>.

<a href="Janice%20Jordan%20Shefelman">Janice Jordan Shefelman</a> wrote a children's book detailing the life of Vivaldi entitled "I, Vivaldi".

Classical Kids Music Education produces live theatre productions, and has issued a CD entitled Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery an original fictional story about an orphan girl in the early 1700s who is in search of her roots. A central clue to the mystery is a missing Stradivarius violin that the Duke of Cremona has brought to Vivaldi’s school of the Pieta in the hopes of finding his long lost grandchild. Vivaldi music is featured throughout the story to support the narrative.

Adrian is a form of the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> <a href="given%20name">given name</a> "<a href="Adrianus%20%28disambiguation%29">Adrianus</a>" or "<a href="Hadrianus%20%28disambiguation%29">Hadrianus</a>". Its ultimate origin is most likely via the former river <a href="Adria%20%28river%29">Adria</a> from the <a href="Venetic%20language">Venetic</a> and <a href="Illyrian%20languages">Illyrian</a> word "adur", meaning 'sea' or 'water'. The Adria was until the 8th century BC the main channel of the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a> into the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> but ceased to exist before the 1st century BC. <a href="Hecataeus%20of%20Miletus">Hecataeus of Miletus</a> (c.550 - c.476 BC) asserted that both the <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> harbor city of <a href="Adria">Adria</a> and the Adriatic Sea had been named after it. Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>'s family was named after the city or region of Adria/Hadria, now <a href="Atri%2C%20Abruzzo">Atri</a>, in <a href="Picenum">Picenum</a>, which most likely started as an Etruscan or Greek colony of the older harbor city of the same name. 

Several <a href="saints">saints</a> and six popes have borne this name, including the only English pope, <a href="Adrian%20IV">Adrian IV</a>, and the only Dutch pope, <a href="Adrian%20VI">Adrian VI</a>. As an English name, it has been in use since the Middle Ages, although it did not become common until modern times.

Aare

The Aare () or Aar is a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="High%20Rhine">High Rhine</a> and the longest <a href="river">river</a> that both rises and ends entirely within <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.

Its total length from its source to its junction with the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> comprises about , during which distance it descends , draining an area of , almost entirely within Switzerland, and accounting for close to half the area of the country, including all of <a href="Central%20Switzerland">Central Switzerland</a>.

There are more than 40 <a href="hydroelectric%20plant">hydroelectric plant</a>s along the course of the Aare River.

The <a href="hydronymy">river's name</a> dates to at least the <a href="La%20T%C3%A8ne%20period">La Tène period</a>, and it is attested as "Nantaror" "Aare valley" in the <a href="Berne%20zinc%20tablet">Berne zinc tablet</a>.

The name was Latinized as "Arula"/"Arola"/"Araris".

The Aare rises in the great <a href="Aargletschers">Aargletschers</a> (Aare Glaciers) of the <a href="Bernese%20Alps">Bernese Alps</a>, in the <a href="canton%20of%20Bern">canton of Bern</a> and west of the <a href="Grimsel%20Pass">Grimsel Pass</a>. The <a href="Finsteraarhorn">Finsteraargletscher</a> and <a href="Lauteraarhorn">Lauteraargletscher</a> come together to form the <a href="Unteraargletscher">Unteraargletscher</a> (Lower Aar Glacier), which is the main source of water for the <a href="Grimselsee">Grimselsee</a> (Lake of Grimsel). The <a href="Oberaargletscher">Oberaargletscher</a> (Upper Aar Glacier) feeds the <a href="Oberaarsee">Oberaarsee</a>, which also flows into the Grimselsee. The Aare leaves the Grimselsee just to the east to the <a href="Grimsel%20Hospiz">Grimsel Hospiz</a>, below the <a href="Grimsel%20Pass">Grimsel Pass</a>, and then flows northwest through the <a href="Haslital">Haslital</a>, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall, , past <a href="Guttannen">Guttannen</a>.

Right after <a href="Innertkirchen">Innertkirchen</a> it is joined by its first major tributary, the <a href="Gamderwasser">Gamderwasser</a>. Less than later the river carves through a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> ridge in the <a href="Aare%20Gorge">Aare Gorge</a> (). It is here that the Aare proves itself to be more than just a river, as it attracts thousands of tourists annually to the causeways through the gorge. A little past <a href="Meiringen">Meiringen</a>, near <a href="Brienz">Brienz</a>, the river expands into <a href="Lake%20Brienz">Lake Brienz</a>. Near the west end of the lake it indirectly receives its first important <a href="tributary">tributary</a>, the <a href="L%C3%BCtschine">Lütschine</a>, by the Lake of Brienz. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli (Swiss German diminutive for ground) between <a href="Interlaken">Interlaken</a> and <a href="Unterseen">Unterseen</a> before flowing into <a href="Lake%20Thun">Lake Thun</a>.

Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river indirectly receives the waters of the <a href="Kander%20%28Switzerland%29">Kander</a>, which has just been joined by the <a href="Simme">Simme</a>, by the Lake of Thun. Lake Thun marks the <a href="head%20of%20navigation">head of navigation</a>. On flowing out of the lake it passes through <a href="Thun">Thun</a>, and then flows through the city of <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, passing beneath <a href="List%20of%20Aare%20bridges%20in%20Bern">eighteen bridges</a> and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the <a href="Old%20City%20of%20Berne">Old City of Berne</a> is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the <a href="Saane/Sarine">Saane or La Sarine</a> it turns north until it nears <a href="Aarberg">Aarberg</a>. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the <a href="Jura%20water%20correction">Jura water correction</a>, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a <a href="swampland">swampland</a> through frequent flooding, was diverted by the <a href="Aare-Hagneck%20Canal">Aare-Hagneck Canal</a> into the <a href="Lac%20de%20Bienne">Lac de Bienne</a>. From the upper end of the lake, at <a href="Nidau">Nidau</a>, the river issues through the <a href="Nidau-B%C3%BCren%20Canal">Nidau-Büren Canal</a>, also called the Aare Canal, and then runs east to <a href="B%C3%BCren%2C%20Solothurn">Büren</a>. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the "vegetable garden of Switzerland".

From here the Aare flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town <a href="Solothurn">Solothurn</a> (below which the Grosse <a href="Emme%20%28river%29">Emme</a> flows in on the right), <a href="Aarburg">Aarburg</a> (where it is joined by the <a href="Wigger%20%28river%29">Wigger</a>), <a href="Olten">Olten</a>, <a href="Aarau">Aarau</a>, near which is the junction with the <a href="Suhre">Suhre</a>, and Wildegg, where the Seetal <a href="Aabach%20%28Seetal%29">Aabach</a> falls in on the right. A short distance further, below <a href="Brugg">Brugg</a> it receives first the <a href="Reuss%20%28river%29">Reuss</a>, its major tributary, and shortly afterwards the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a>, its second strongest tributary. It now turns to north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, which it even surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite downsstreams from <a href="Koblenz%2C%20Switzerland">Koblenz (Switzerland)</a>, opposite <a href="Waldshut-Tiengen">Waldshut</a> in Germany. The Rhine, in turn, empties into the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> after crossing into the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

Abbotsford House

Abbotsford is a historic <a href="Scottish%20estate%20houses">country house</a> in the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Scottish Borders</a>, near <a href="Melrose%2C%20Scottish%20Borders">Melrose</a>, on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Tweed">River Tweed</a>. It was formerly the residence of <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>ist and <a href="poet">poet</a>, Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>. It is a Category A <a href="Listed%20Building">Listed Building</a>.

The nucleus of the estate was a small farm of , called Cartleyhole, nicknamed Clarty (i.e., muddy) Hole, and was bought by Scott on the lapse of his lease (1811) of the neighbouring house of Ashestiel. He first built a small villa and named it Abbotsford, creating the name from a ford nearby where previously <a href="abbot">abbot</a>s of <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a> used to cross the river. Scott then built additions to the house and made it into a mansion, building into the walls many sculptured stones from ruined castles and abbeys of Scotland. In it he gathered a large library, a collection of ancient <a href="furniture">furniture</a>, arms and armour, and other relics and curiosities, especially connected with <a href="Scottish%20history">Scottish history</a>, notably the Celtic <a href="Torrs%20Pony-cap%20and%20Horns">Torrs Pony-cap and Horns</a> and the <a href="Woodwrae%20Stone">Woodwrae Stone</a>, all now in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Scotland">Museum of Scotland</a>.

The last and principal acquisition was that of Toftfield (afterwards named Huntlyburn), purchased in 1817. The new house was then begun and completed in 1824.

The general ground-plan is a parallelogram, with irregular outlines, one side overlooking the Tweed; and the style is mainly the <a href="Scottish%20Baronial">Scottish Baronial</a>. Into various parts of the fabric were built relics and curiosities from historical structures, such as the doorway of the <a href="Old%20Tolbooth%2C%20Edinburgh">old Tolbooth</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.

Scott had only enjoyed his residence one year when (1825) he met with that reverse of fortune which involved the estate in debt. In 1830, the library and museum were presented to him as a free gift by the creditors. The property was wholly disencumbered in 1847 by <a href="Robert%20Cadell">Robert Cadell</a>, the publisher, who cancelled the bond upon it in exchange for the family's share in the copyright of Sir Walter's works. 

Scott's only son Walter did not live to enjoy the property, having died on his way from India in 1847. Among subsequent possessors were Scott's son-in-law, <a href="John%20Gibson%20Lockhart">John Gibson Lockhart</a>, <a href="James%20Hope-Scott">J. R. Hope Scott</a>, <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a>, and his daughter (Scott's great-granddaughter), the Hon. Mrs Maxwell Scott.
The house was opened to the public in 1833, but continued to be occupied by Scott's descendants until 2004. The last of his direct descendants to hold the <a href="Laird">Laird</a>ship of Abbotsford was his great-great-great-granddaughter Dame <a href="Jean%20Maxwell-Scott">Jean Maxwell-Scott</a> (8 June 1923 - 5 May 2004). She inherited it from her elder sister <a href="Patricia%20Maxwell-Scott">Patricia Maxwell-Scott</a> in 1998. The sisters turned the house into one of Scotland's premier tourist attractions, after they had to rely on paying visitors to afford the upkeep of the house. It had electricity installed only in 1962. Dame Jean was at one time a lady-in-waiting to <a href="Princess%20Alice%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Gloucester">Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester</a>, patron of the <a href="Dandie%20Dinmont%20Terrier">Dandie Dinmont</a> Club, a breed of dog named after one of Sir Walter Scott's characters; and a horse trainer, one of whose horses, Sir Wattie, ridden by Ian Stark, won two silver medals at the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a>.

In 2005, <a href="Scottish%20Borders%20Council">Scottish Borders Council</a> was considering an application by a property developer to build a housing estate on the opposite bank of the River Tweed from Abbotsford, to which <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> and the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland">National Trust for Scotland</a> objected.

Sir Walter Scott rescued the "<a href="jougs">jougs</a>" from <a href="Threave%20Castle">Threave Castle</a> in <a href="Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a> and attached them to the castellated gateway he built at Abbotsford.

<a href="Tweedbank%20railway%20station">Tweedbank railway station</a> is located near to Abbotsford House.

Abbotsford gave its name to the <a href="Abbotsford%20Club">Abbotsford Club</a>, founded by <a href="William%20Barclay%20Turnbull">William Barclay Turnbull</a> in 1833 or 1834 in Scott's honour, and a successor to the <a href="Bannatyne%20Club">Bannatyne</a> and <a href="Maitland%20Club">Maitland Club</a>s. It was a <a href="text%20publication%20society">text publication society</a>, which existed to print and publish historical works connected with Scott's writings. Its publications extended from 1835 to 1864.

In 2012, a new Visitor Centre opened at Abbotsford which houses a small exhibition, gift shop and Ochiltree's Dining, a cafe/restaurant with views over the house and grounds.

In 2014 it won the <a href="European%20Union%20Prize%20for%20Cultural%20Heritage%20/%20Europa%20Nostra%20Awards">European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award</a> for its recent conservation project.

Abraham

Abraham (, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>: إبراهيم "Ibrahim"), originally Avram or Abram, is the common patriarch of the three <a href="Abrahamic%20religions">Abrahamic religions</a>.
In Judaism he is the founding father of the <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">Covenant</a>, the special relationship between the Jewish people and <a href="God%20in%20Judaism">God</a>; in Christianity, he is the prototype of all believers, Jewish or Gentile; and in Islam he is seen as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>.

The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. Abraham is called by <a href="God">God</a> to leave the house of his father <a href="Terah">Terah</a> and settle in the land originally given to <a href="Canaan%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Canaan</a>, but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham, but all are dismissed except for <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a>, his son by his half-sister <a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>. Abraham purchases a tomb (the <a href="Cave%20of%20the%20Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a>) at <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a> to be Sarah's grave, thus establishing his right to the land, and in the second generation his heir Isaac is married to a woman from his own kin, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any inheritance. Abraham later marries <a href="Keturah">Keturah</a> and has six more sons, but on his death, when he is buried beside Sarah, it is Isaac who receives "all Abraham's goods", while the other sons receive only "gifts" (Genesis 25:5–8).

The Abraham story cannot be definitively related to any specific time, and it is widely agreed that the <a href="patriarchal%20age">patriarchal age</a>, along with the <a href="The%20Exodus">exodus</a> and the period of the judges, is a late literary construct that does not relate to any period in actual history. A common hypothesis among scholars is that it was composed in the early Persian period (late 6th century BCE) as a result of tensions between Jewish landowners who had stayed in <a href="Yehud%20Medinata">Judah</a> during the <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Babylonian captivity</a> and traced their right to the land through their "father Abraham", and the returning exiles who based their counter-claim on <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a> tradition.

<a href="Terah">Terah</a>, the ninth in descent from <a href="Noah">Noah</a>, was the father of three sons: Abram, <a href="Nahor%2C%20son%20of%20Terah">Nahor</a>, and <a href="Haran">Haran</a>. Haran was the father of <a href="Lot%20%28Bible%29">Lot</a> (who was thus Abram's nephew), and died in his native city, <a href="Ur%20of%20the%20Chaldees">Ur of the Chaldees</a>. Abram married <a href="Sarah">Sarah (Sarai)</a>, who was barren. Terah, with Abram, Sarai, and Lot, then departed for Canaan, but settled in a place named <a href="Haran%20%28biblical%20place%29">Haran</a>, where Terah died at the age of 205. God had told Abram to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him, and promised to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless them that bless him, and curse them who may curse him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the substance and souls that they had acquired, and traveled to <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> in <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>.

There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan, so that Abram and Lot and their households, traveled south to <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>. On the way Abram told his wife Sarai to say that she was his sister, so that the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ians would not kill him. When they entered Egypt, the Pharaoh's officials praised Sarai's beauty to <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>, and she was taken into his palace, and Abram was given provisions: "oxen, and he-asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she-asses, and camels". However, God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with great plagues, for which he tried to find the reason. Upon discovering that Sarai was a married woman, Pharaoh demanded that they and their household leave immediately, with all their goods.

When they came back to the Bethel and Hai area, Abram's and Lot's sizable livestock herds occupied the same pastures. This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each family's cattle. The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abram suggested that Lot choose a separate area, either on the left hand (north) or on the right hand (south), that there be no conflict amongst brethren. But Lot chose to go the plain of <a href="Jordan%20river">Jordan</a> where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar, and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom</a>. Abram went south to <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a> and settled in the plain of <a href="Mamre">Mamre</a>, where he built another altar to worship <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God</a>.

During the rebellion of the <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Jordan River cities</a> against <a href="Elam">Elam</a>, Abram's nephew, Lot, was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading <a href="Elam">Elam</a>ite forces. The Elamite army came to collect the spoils of war, after having just defeated the king of Sodom's armies. Lot and his family, at the time, were settled on the outskirts of the <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Kingdom of Sodom</a> which made them a visible target.

One person who escaped capture came and told Abram what happened. Once Abram received this news, he immediately assembled 318 trained servants. Abram's force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army, who were already worn down from the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Vale%20of%20Siddim">Battle of Siddim</a>. When they caught up with them at <a href="Dan%20%28Bible%29">Dan</a>, Abram devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit, and launched a night raid. Not only were they able to free the captives, Abram's unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King <a href="Chedorlaomer">Chedorlaomer</a> at Hobah, just north of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>. They freed Lot, as well as his household and possessions, and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken.

Upon Abram's return, Sodom's king came out to meet with him in the <a href="King%27s%20dale">Valley of Shaveh</a>, the "king's dale". Also, <a href="Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a> king of Salem (<a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>), a priest of <a href="Elyon">God Most High</a>, brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God. Abram then gave Melchizedek a <a href="tithe">tenth</a> of everything. The king of Sodom then offered to let Abram keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people. Abram refused any deal from the king of Sodom, other than the share to which his allies were entitled.

The voice of the Lord came to Abram in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars. Abram and God made a covenant ceremony, and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt. God described to Abram the land that his offspring would claim: the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaims, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.

Abram and Sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations, because after 10 years of living in Canaan, no child had been born. Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden, <a href="Hagar">Hagar</a>, to Abram with the intention that she would bear him a son. After Hagar found she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress, Sarai. Therefore, Sarai mistreated Hagar, and Hagar fled away. En route an angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain in the way to <a href="Shur%20%28Bible%29">Shur</a>. He instructed her to return and that her son would be "a wild ass of a man; his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren." She was told to call her son <a href="Ishmael">Ishmael</a>. Hagar then called God who spoke to her "<a href="El%20Roi">El-roi</a>", ("Thou God seest me:" KJV). From that day, the well was called Beer-lahai-roi, ("The well of him that liveth and seeth me." KJV margin). She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child. Abram was eighty-six years of age when Ishmael was born.

Thirteen years later, when Abram was ninety-nine years of age, God declared Abram's new name: "Abraham" – "a father of many nations". Abraham then received the instructions for the covenant, of which <a href="Religious%20male%20circumcision">circumcision</a> was to be the sign. Then God declared Sarai's new name: "<a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>" and blessed her and told Abraham, "I will give thee a son also of her". But Abraham laughed, and "said in his heart, 'Shall a "child" be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?'" Immediately after Abraham's encounter with God, he had his entire household of men, including himself (age 99) and Ishmael (age 13), circumcised.

Not long afterward, during the heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the <a href="Pistacia%20palaestina">terebinths</a> of <a href="Mamre">Mamre</a>. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran and <a href="Bowing%20%28social%29">bowed</a> to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to <a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>'s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf. When all was prepared, he set curds, milk and the calf before them, waiting on them, under a tree, as they ate.

One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age, as nothing is too hard for God. Frightened, Sarah denied laughing.

After eating, Abraham and the three visitors got up. They walked over to the peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a> for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that "if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?" For the sake of ten righteous people, God declared that he would not destroy the city.

When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report, they planned on staying in the city square. However, Abraham's nephew, Lot, met with them and strongly insisted that these two "men" stay at his house for the night. A rally of men stood outside of Lot's home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may "know" (v.5) them. However, Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not "known" (v.8) man to the rally of men instead. They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lot's door to get to his male guests, thus confirming the wickedness of the city and portending their imminent destruction.

Early the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he stood before God. He "looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah" and saw what became of the cities of the plain, where not even "ten righteous" (v.18:32) had been found, as "the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace."

Abraham settled between <a href="Kadesh%20%28South%20of%20Israel%29">Kadesh</a> and <a href="Shur%20%28Bible%29">Shur</a> in the land of the <a href="Philistine">Philistine</a>s. While he was living in <a href="Gerar">Gerar</a>, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon discovering this news, King <a href="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid hands on her, so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.

Early next morning, Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom. Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place, and that they might kill him for his wife. Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all: "And yet indeed "she is" my sister; she "is" the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife." Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham, and gave him gifts of sheep, oxen, and servants; and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech's lands. Further, Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarah's vindication before all. Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household, since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah.

After living for some time in the land of the Philistines, <a href="Abimelech">Abimelech</a> and <a href="Phicol">Phicol</a>, the chief of his troops, approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well. Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servant's aggressive attacks and the seizing of <a href="Abraham%27s%20well">Abraham's well</a>. Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident. Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech. Further, to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well, he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof. Because of this sworn oath, they called the place of this well: <a href="Beersheba">Beersheba</a>. After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to <a href="Philistia">Philistia</a>, Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called upon "the name of the , the everlasting God."

As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was "an hundred years old", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, "God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me." Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.

<a href="Ishmael">Ishmael</a> was fourteen years old when Abraham's son <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a> was born to a different mother, Sarah. Sarah had finally borne her own child, even though she had passed her child-bearing period. When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac, Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away. She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed by his wife's words and sought the advice of his God. God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded. God reassured Abraham that "in Isaac shall seed be called to thee." He also said that Ishmael would make a nation, "because he is thy seed".

Early the next morning, Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together. He gave her bread and water and sent them away. The two wandered in the wilderness of <a href="Beersheba">Beersheba</a> until her bottle of water was completely consumed. In a moment of despair, she burst into tears. After God heard the boy's voice, an <a href="angel%20of%20the%20Lord">angel of the Lord</a> confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation. A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives. As the boy grew, he became a skilled <a href="Archery">archer</a> living in the wilderness of <a href="Desert%20of%20Paran">Paran</a>. Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country, the land of Egypt.

At some point in <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a>'s youth, Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of <a href="Moriah">Moriah</a>. The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of. He then commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount. Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed. Along the way, Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was, to which Abraham replied "God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering". Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, he was interrupted by the angel of the Lord, and he saw behind him a "ram caught in a thicket by his horns", which he sacrificed instead of his son. For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity. After this event, Abraham went to <a href="Beersheba">Beersheba</a>.

Sarah died, and Abraham buried her in the <a href="Cave%20of%20the%20Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a> (the "cave of Machpelah"), near <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a> which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from Ephron the <a href="Biblical%20Hittites">Hittite</a>. After the death of Sarah, Abraham took another wife, a <a href="concubine">concubine</a> named <a href="Keturah">Keturah</a>, by whom he had six sons: <a href="Zimran">Zimran</a>, <a href="Jokshan">Jokshan</a>, <a href="Medan%20%28son%20of%20Abraham%29">Medan</a>, <a href="Midian%20%28son%20of%20Abraham%29">Midian</a>, <a href="Ishbak">Ishbak</a>, and <a href="Shuah">Shuah</a>. According to the Bible, reflecting the change of his name to "Abraham" meaning "a father of many nations", Abraham is considered to be the progenitor of many nations mentioned in the Bible, among others the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>, <a href="Ishmaelites">Ishmaelites</a>, <a href="Edom">Edom</a>ites,) <a href="Amalek%23Amalekites%20in%20the%20Hebrew%20Bible">Amalekites</a>, <a href="Kenizzite">Kenizzite</a>s, <a href="Midian">Midian</a>ites and <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>, and through his nephew Lot he was also related to the <a href="Moab">Moab</a>ites and <a href="Ammon">Ammon</a>ites. Abraham lived to see his son marry <a href="Rebekah">Rebekah</a>, (and to see the birth of his twin grandsons <a href="Jacob%20and%20Esau">Jacob and Esau</a>). He died at age 175, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael.

In the early and middle 20th century, leading archaeologists such as <a href="William%20F.%20Albright">William F. Albright</a>, and biblical scholars such as <a href="Albrecht%20Alt">Albrecht Alt</a>, believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the "<a href="patriarchal%20age">patriarchal age</a>", the 2nd millennium BCE. But, in the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in <a href="Thomas%20L.%20Thompson">Thomas L. Thompson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Historicity%20of%20the%20Patriarchal%20Narratives">The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives</a>" (1974), and <a href="John%20Van%20Seters">John Van Seters</a>' "<a href="Abraham%20in%20History%20and%20Tradition">Abraham in History and Tradition</a>" (1975). Thompson, a literary scholar, based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts. His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium BCE, and noted how certain biblical texts reflected first millennium conditions and concerns. Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names, social milieu, and messages strongly suggested that they were <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> creations. By the beginning of the 21st century, archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures.

Abraham's name is apparently very ancient, as the tradition found in Genesis no longer understands its original meaning (probably "Father is exalted" – the meaning offered in Genesis 17:5, "Father of a multitude", is a <a href="false%20etymology">popular etymology</a>). The story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory. At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the <a href="Pentateuch">Pentateuch</a>; a majority of scholars believe this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520–320 BCE. The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown, but there are currently two important hypotheses. The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay "elders".

Nevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones – the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions. In <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> , written during the Exile (i.e., in the first half of the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they don't observe Torah. <a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a> similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the "<a href="Golah">gôlâ</a>"), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham. The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence (e.g., <a href="Ezra-Nehemiah">Ezra-Nehemiah</a>), is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after, serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles.

Abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="Islam">Islam</a>. In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant, the special relationship between the Jewish people and God – a belief which gives the Jews a unique position as the <a href="Jews%20as%20the%20chosen%20people">Chosen People of God</a>. In Christianity, the Apostle <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a> taught that Abraham's faith in God – preceding the <a href="Mosaic%20law">Mosaic law</a> – made him the prototype of all believers, <a href="circumcision">circumcised</a> and uncircumcised. The Islamic prophet <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> claimed Abraham, whose submission to God constituted "Islam" as a "believer before the fact" and undercut Jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with God and the Covenant.

In Jewish tradition, Abraham is called "Avraham Avinu" (אברהם אבינו), "our father Abraham," signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews (including converts, according to Jewish tradition), and the father of Judaism, the first Jew. His story is read in the weekly <a href="Torah">Torah</a> reading portions, predominantly in the <a href="parashot">parashot</a>: <a href="Lech-Lecha%20%28parsha%29">Lech-Lecha</a> (לֶךְ-לְךָ), <a href="Vayeira%20%28parsha%29">Vayeira</a> (וַיֵּרָא), <a href="Chayei%20Sarah%20%28parsha%29">Chayei Sarah</a> (חַיֵּי שָׂרָה), and <a href="Toledot%20%28parsha%29">Toledot</a> (תּוֹלְדֹת).

A cryptic story in the <a href="Babylonian%20Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a> states that "On the eve of every <a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, <a href="Judah%20the%20Prince">Judah the Prince</a>'s pupils, <a href="Haninah">Rab Hanina</a> and <a href="Rab%20Hoshaiah">Rab Hoshaiah</a>, who devoted themselves especially to <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a>, used to create a delicious <a href="calf%20%28animal%29">calf</a> by means of the "Sefer Yetzirah", and ate it on the <a href="Shabbat">Sabbath</a>." Mystics assert that the biblical patriarch Abraham used the same method to create the calf prepared for the three angels who foretold <a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>'s pregnancy in the biblical account at .

Abraham does not loom so large in Christianity as he does in Judaism and Islam. It is <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> as the <a href="Messiah">Jewish Messiah</a> who is central to Christianity, and the idea of a divine <a href="Christ%20%28title%29">Messiah</a> is what separates Christianity from the other two religions. In <a href="Letter%20to%20the%20Romans">Romans</a> 4, Abraham's merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in God's ultimate grace; this faith provides him the merit for God having chosen him for the covenant, and the covenant becomes one of faith, not obedience.

The Roman Catholic Church calls Abraham "our father in Faith" in the <a href="Eucharistic%20prayer">Eucharistic prayer</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Canon">Roman Canon</a>, recited during the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> (see "<a href="Abraham%20in%20the%20Catholic%20liturgy">Abraham in the Catholic liturgy</a>"). He is also commemorated in the <a href="calendar%20of%20saints">calendars of saints</a> of several denominations: on 20 August by the <a href="Maronite%20Church">Maronite Church</a>, 28 August in the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic Church</a> and the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> (with the full <a href="daily%20office">office</a> for the latter), and on 9 October by the Roman Catholic Church and the <a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a>. In the introduction to his 15th-century translation of the <a href="Golden%20Legend">Golden Legend</a>'s account of Abraham, <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a> noted that this patriarch's life was read in church on <a href="Sunday%20before%20Lent">Quinquagesima Sunday</a>.
He is the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of those in the hospitality industry. The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> commemorates him as the "Righteous Forefather Abraham", with two <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a>s in its <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church%20liturgical%20calendar">liturgical calendar</a>. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional <a href="Julian%20Calendar">Julian Calendar</a>, 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern <a href="Gregorian%20Calendar">Gregorian Calendar</a>), where he is commemorated together with his nephew "Righteous Lot". The other is on the "Sunday of the Forefathers" (two Sundays before Christmas), when he is commemorated together with other <a href="Genealogy%20of%20Jesus">ancestors of Jesus</a>. Abraham is also mentioned in the <a href="Divine%20Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> of <a href="Saint%20Basil%20the%20Great">Saint Basil the Great</a>, just before the Anaphora, and Abraham and Sarah are invoked in the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple.

Islam regards Abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>.

<a href="Abraham%20in%20Islam">Ibrāhīm</a> is mentioned in 35 chapters of the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, more often than any other biblical personage apart from <a href="Moses%20in%20Islam">Moses</a>. He is called both a "hanif" (<a href="monotheist">monotheist</a>) and "muslim" (one who submits), and Muslims regard him as a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> and <a href="patriarch">patriarch</a>, the archetype of the perfect <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, and the revered reformer of the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a> in <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. Islamic traditions consider <a href="Abraham%20in%20Islam">Ibrāhīm</a> (Abraham) the first Pioneer of Islam (which is also called "millat Ibrahim", the "religion of Abraham"), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the <a href="Tawhid">Oneness of God</a>. In Islam, Abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as "Ibrahim Khalilullah", meaning "Abraham the Friend [of Allah]".

Paintings on the life of Abraham tend to focus on only a few incidents: the sacrifice of Isaac; meeting Melchizedek; entertaining the three angels; Hagar in the desert; and a few others. Additionally, Martin O'Kane, a professor of Biblical Studies, writes that the parable of <a href="Rich%20man%20and%20Lazarus">Lazarus</a> resting in the "<a href="Bosom%20of%20Abraham">Bosom of Abraham</a>", as described in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, became an iconic image in Christian works. According to O'Kane, artists often chose to divert from the common literary portrayal of Lazarus sitting next to Abraham at a banquet in Heaven and instead focus on the "somewhat incongruous notion of Abraham, the most venerated of patriarchs, holding a naked and vulnerable child in his bosom". Several artists have been inspired by the life of Abraham, including <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> (1471–1528), <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> (1573–1610), <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a>, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Philip van Dyck</a> (Dutch painter, 1680–1753), and <a href="Claude%20Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</a> (French painter, 1600–1682). <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a> (Dutch, 1606–1669) created at least seven works on Abraham, <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> (1577–1640) did several, <a href="Marc%20Chagall">Marc Chagall</a> did at least five on Abraham, Gustave Doré (French illustrator, 1832–1883) did six, and <a href="James%20Tissot">James Tissot</a> (French painter and illustrator, 1836–1902) did over twenty works on the subject.

The <a href="Sarcophagus%20of%20Junius%20Bassus">Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</a> depicts a set of biblical stories, including Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac. These sculpted scenes are on the outside of a marble <a href="Early%20Christian%20art">Early Christian</a> <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> used for the burial of <a href="Junius%20Bassus">Junius Bassus</a>. He died in 359. This sarcophagus has been described as "probably the single most famous piece of early Christian relief sculpture." The sarcophagus was originally placed in or under <a href="Old%20St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">Old St. Peter's Basilica</a>, was rediscovered in 1597, and is now below the modern basilica in the Museo Storico del Tesoro della Basilica di San Pietro (Museum of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>) in the <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a>. The base is approximately 4 × 8 × 4 feet. The Old Testament scenes depicted were chosen as precursors of Christ's sacrifice in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, in an early form of <a href="Typology%20%28theology%29">typology</a>. Just to the right of the middle is Daniel in the lion's den and on the left is Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac.

<a href="George%20Segal%20%28artist%29">George Segal</a> created figural sculptures by molding plastered gauze strips over live models in his 1987 work "Abraham's Farewell to Ishmael". The human condition was central to his concerns, and Segal used the Old Testament as a source for his imagery. This sculpture depicts the dilemma faced by Abraham when Sarah demanded that he expel Hagar and Ishmael. In the sculpture, the father's tenderness, Sarah's rage, and Hagar's resigned acceptance portray a range of human emotions. The sculpture was donated to the Miami Art Museum after the artist's death in 2000.

Usually Abraham can be identified by the context of the image the meeting with <a href="Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a>, , or . In solo portraits a sword or knife may be used as his attribute, as in by Gian Maria Morlaiter or by Lorenzo Monaco. He always wears a gray or white beard.

As early as the beginning of the 3rd century, Christian art followed Christian <a href="Typology%20%28theology%29%23Sacrifice%20of%20Isaac">typology</a> in making the sacrifice of Isaac a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice on the cross and its memorial in the sacrifice of the Mass. See for example engraved with Abraham's and other sacrifices taken to prefigure that of Christ in the Eucharist.

Some early Christian writers interpreted the three visitors as the <a href="triune%20God">triune God</a>. Thus in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, portrays only the visitors against a gold ground and puts semitransparent copies of them in the "heavenly" space above the scene. In Eastern Orthodox art the visit is the chief means by which the Trinity is pictured (). Some images do not include Abraham and Sarah, like Andrei Rublev's "Trinity", which shows only the three visitors as beardless youths at a table.

"<a href="Fear%20and%20Trembling">Fear and Trembling</a>" (original <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> title: "Frygt og Bæven") is an influential philosophical work by <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, published in 1843 under the pseudonym "Johannes de silentio" ("John the Silent"). Kierkegaard wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been present in Abraham when God asked him to sacrifice his son.

In 1994, <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a> released an opera named "<a href="The%20Cave%20%28opera%29">The Cave</a>". The title refers to the <a href="Cave%20of%20the%20Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a>. The narrative of the opera is based on the story of Abraham and his immediate family as it is recounted in the various religious texts, and as it is understood by individual people from different cultures and religious traditions.

<a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited%20%28song%29">Highway 61 Revisited</a>" is the title track for his 1965 album "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited">Highway 61 Revisited</a>". In 2004, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked the song as number 364 in their <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>. The song has five stanzas. In each stanza, someone describes an unusual problem that is ultimately resolved on Highway 61. In Stanza 1, <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God</a> tells Abraham to "<a href="Binding%20of%20Isaac">kill me a son</a>". God wants the killing done on Highway 61. Abram, the original name of the biblical Abraham, is also the name of Dylan's own father.

Abraxas

Abraxas (<a href="Greek%20language">Gk.</a> ΑΒΡΑΞΑΣ, variant form Abrasax, ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ) was a word of mystic meaning in the system of the <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> <a href="Basilides">Basilides</a>, being there applied to the "Great <a href="Archon%20%28Gnosticism%29">Archon</a>" (Gk., "megas archōn"), the <a href="princeps">princeps</a> of the 365 spheres (Gk., "ouranoi"). The word is found in Gnostic texts such as the "<a href="Coptic%20Gospel%20of%20the%20Egyptians">Holy pageRank.Book of the Great Invisible Spirit</a>", and also appears in the <a href="Greek%20Magical%20Papyri">Greek Magical Papyri</a>. It was engraved on certain <a href="Engraved%20gem">antique gemstones</a>, called on that account Abraxas stones, which were used as <a href="amulets">amulets</a> or charms. As the initial spelling on stones was 'Abrasax' (Αβρασαξ), the spelling of 'Abraxas' seen today probably originates in the confusion made between the Greek letters <a href="Sigma">Sigma</a> and <a href="Xi%20%28letter%29">Xi</a> in the Latin <a href="transliteration">transliteration</a>.

The seven letters spelling its name may represent each of the <a href="classical%20planet">seven classic planets</a>. The word may be related to "<a href="Abracadabra">Abracadabra</a>", although other explanations exist.

There are similarities and differences between such figures in reports about Basilides's teaching, ancient Gnostic texts, the larger Greco-Roman magical traditions, and modern magical and esoteric writings. Opinions abound on Abraxas, who in recent centuries has been claimed to be both an <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian god and a <a href="demon">demon</a>. The Swiss psychiatrist <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> transcribed a short Gnostic treatise in 1916, attributed to Basilides in Alexandria called "<a href="The%20Seven%20Sermons%20to%20the%20Dead">The Seven Sermons to the Dead</a>", which called Abraxas the supreme power of being transcending both <a href="God">God</a> and the <a href="Devil">Devil</a> and unites all opposites into one <a href="Being">Being</a>.

It is uncertain what the actual role and function of Abraxas was in the <a href="Basilideans">Basilidian system</a>, as our authorities (see below) often show no direct acquaintance with the doctrines of <a href="Basilides">Basilides</a> himself.

In the system described by <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>, "the Unbegotten Father" is the progenitor of "<a href="Nous">Nous</a>", and from "Nous <a href="Logos">Logos</a>", from "Logos <a href="Phronesis">Phronesis</a>", from "Phronesis <a href="Sophia%20%28wisdom%29">Sophia</a>" and "<a href="Dunamis">Dynamis</a>", from "Sophia" and "Dynamis" principalities, powers, and angels, the last of whom create "the first heaven." They in turn originate a second series, who create a second heaven. The process continues in like manner until 365 heavens are in existence, the angels of the last or visible heaven being the authors of our world. "The ruler" ["principem, i.e.", probably "ton <a href="archon%20%28Gnosticism%29">archonta</a>"] of the 365 heavens "is Abraxas, and for this reason he contains within himself 365 numbers."

The name occurs in the "<a href="Philosophumena">Refutation of all Heresies</a>" (vii. 26) by <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus</a>, who appears in these chapters to have followed the "Exegetica" of Basilides. After describing the manifestation of the Gospel in the Ogdoad and Hebdomad, he adds that the Basilidians have a long account of the innumerable creations and powers in the several 'stages' of the upper world ("diastemata"), in which they speak of 365 heavens and say that "their great archon" is Abrasax, because his name contains the number 365, the number of the days in the year; i.e. the sum of the numbers denoted by the Greek letters in ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ according to the rules of <a href="isopsephy">isopsephy</a> is 365:

<a href="Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis">Epiphanius</a> ("<a href="Panarion">Haer</a>". 69, 73 f.) appears to follow partly Irenaeus, partly the lost Compendium of Hippolytus. He designates Abraxas more distinctly as "the power above all, and First Principle," "the cause and first archetype" of all things; and mentions that the Basilidians referred to 365 as the number of parts ("mele") in the human body, as well as of days in the year.

The author of the appendix to Tertullian "De Praescr. Haer". (c. 4), who likewise follows Hippolytus's Compendium, adds some further particulars; that 'Abraxas' gave birth to Mind ("nous"), the first in the series of primary powers enumerated likewise by Irenaeus and Epiphanius; that the world, as well as the 365 heavens, was created in honour of 'Abraxas;' and that Christ was sent not by the Maker of the world but by 'Abraxas.'

Nothing can be built on the vague allusions of <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, according to whom 'Abraxas' meant for Basilides "the greatest God" ("De vir. ill". 21), "the highest God" ("Dial. adv. Lucif". 23), "the Almighty God" ("Comm. in Amos" iii. 9), and "the Lord the Creator" ("Comm. in Nah". i. 11). The notices in <a href="Theodoret">Theodoret</a> ("Haer. fab". i. 4), <a href="Augustine">Augustine</a> ("Haer". 4), and 'Praedestinatus' (i. 3), have no independent value.

It is evident from these particulars that Abrasax was the name of the first of the 365 Archons, and accordingly stood below Sophia and Dynamis and their progenitors; but his position is not expressly stated, so that the writer of the supplement to Tertullian had some excuse for confusing him with "the Supreme God."

With the availability of primary sources, such as those in the <a href="Nag%20Hammadi%20library">Nag Hammadi library</a>, the identity of Abrasax remains unclear. The "Holy pageRank.Book of the Great Invisible Spirit", for instance, refers to Abrasax as an <a href="Aeon%20%28Gnosticism%29">Aeon</a> dwelling with <a href="Sophia%20%28wisdom%29">Sophia</a> and other Aeons of the <a href="Pleroma%20Dukias">Pleroma Dukias</a> in the light of the luminary <a href="Eleleth">Eleleth</a>. In several texts, the luminary Eleleth is the last of the luminaries (Spiritual Lights) that come forward, and it is the Aeon Sophia, associated with Eleleth, who encounters darkness and becomes involved in the chain of events that leads to the Demiurge's rule of this world, and the salvage effort that ensues. As such, the role of Aeons of Eleleth, including Abraxas, Sophia, and others, pertains to this outer border of the Pleroma that encounters the ignorance of the world of Lack and interacts to rectify the error of ignorance in the world of materiality.

The Catholic church later deemed Abraxas a pagan god, and ultimately branded him a demon as documented in J. Collin de Plancy's "<a href="Dictionnaire%20Infernal">Infernal Dictionary</a>", Abraxas (or Abracax) is labeled the "supreme God" of the Basilidians, whom he describes as "heretics of the second century." He further indicated the Basilidians attributed to Abraxas the rule over "365 skies" and "365 virtues". In a final statement on Basilidians, de Plancy states that their view was that Jesus Christ was merely a "benevolent ghost sent on Earth by Abracax."

A vast number of engraved stones are in existence, to which the name "Abrasax-stones" has long been given. One particularly fine example was included as part of the <a href="Thetford%20treasure">Thetford treasure</a> from fourth century Norfolk, UK. The subjects are mythological, and chiefly grotesque, with various inscriptions, in which ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ often occurs, alone or with other words. Sometimes the whole space is taken up with the inscription. In certain obscure magical writings of Egyptian origin ἀβραξάς or ἀβρασάξ is found associated with other names which frequently accompany it on gems; it is also found on the Greek metal "tesseræ" among other mystic words. The meaning of the legends is seldom intelligible: but some of the gems are amulets; and the same may be the case with nearly all.


In a great majority of instances the name Abrasax is associated with a singular composite figure, having a <a href="Chimera%20%28mythology%29">Chimera</a>-like appearance somewhat resembling a <a href="basilisk">basilisk</a> or the Greek primordial god <a href="Chronos">Chronos</a> (not to be confused with the Greek titan <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a>). According to <a href="E.%20A.%20Wallis%20Budge">E. A. Wallis Budge</a>, "as a Pantheus, i.e. All-God, he appears on the amulets with the head of a <a href="rooster">cock</a> (<a href="Ph%C5%93bus">Phœbus</a>) or of a lion (<a href="Ra">Ra</a> or <a href="Mithras">Mithras</a>), the body of a man, and his legs are serpents which terminate in scorpions, types of the <a href="Agathodaemon">Agathodaimon</a>. In his right hand he grasps a club, or a flail, and in his left is a round or oval shield." This form was also referred to as the <a href="Anguipede">Anguipede</a>. Budge surmised that Abrasax was "a form of the <a href="Adam%20Kadmon">Adam Kadmon</a> of the <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalists</a> and the Primal Man whom God made in His own image."

Some parts at least of the figure mentioned above are <a href="solar%20symbol">solar symbol</a>s, and the Basilidian Abrasax is manifestly connected with the sun. J. J. Bellermann has speculated that "the whole represents the Supreme Being, with his Five great Emanations, each one pointed out by means of an expressive emblem. Thus, from the human body, the usual form assigned to the Deity, forasmuch as it is written that God created man in his own image, issue the two supporters, "Nous" and "Logos", symbols of the inner sense and the quickening understanding, as typified by the serpents, for the same reason that had induced the old Greeks to assign this reptile for an attribute to Pallas. His head—a cock's—represents "Phronesis", the fowl being emblematical of foresight and vigilance. His two hands bear the badges of "Sophia" and "Dynamis", the shield of Wisdom, and the scourge of Power."

In the absence of other evidence to show the origin of these curious relics of antiquity the occurrence of a name known as Basilidian on patristic authority has not unnaturally been taken as a sufficient mark of origin, and the early collectors and critics assumed this whole group to be the work of Gnostics. During the last three centuries attempts have been made to sift away successively those gems that had no claim to be considered in any sense Gnostic, or specially Basilidian, or connected with Abrasax. The subject is one which has exercised the ingenuity of many savants, but it may be said that all the engraved stones fall into three classes:

While it would be rash to assert positively that no existing gems were the work of Gnostics, there is no valid reason for attributing all of them to such an origin. The fact that the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what Irenaeus says about the followers of Basilides:

Incantations by mystic names were characteristic of the hybrid Gnosticism planted in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and southern <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, which <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> connects with Basilides and which (according to his "Epist"., lxxv.) used the name Abrasax.

It is therefore not unlikely that some Gnostics used amulets, though the confident assertions of modern writers to this effect rest on no authority. <a href="Isaac%20de%20Beausobre">Isaac de Beausobre</a> properly calls attention to the significant silence of <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement</a> in the two passages in which he instructs the Christians of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on the right use of rings and gems, and the figures which may legitimately be engraved on them ("Paed". 241 ff.; 287 ff.). But no attempt to identify the figures on existing gems with the personages of Gnostic mythology has had any success, and "Abrasax" is the only Gnostic term found in the accompanying legends that is not known to belong to other religions or mythologies. The present state of the evidence therefore suggests that their engravers and the Basilidians received the mystic name from a common source now unknown.

Having due regard to the <a href="Greek%20Magical%20Papyri">magic papyri</a>, in which many of the unintelligible names of the Abrasax-stones reappear, besides directions for making and using gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it can scarcely be doubted that many of these stones are pagan amulets and instruments of magic.

The magic papyri reflect the same ideas as the Abrasax-gems and often bear Hebraic names of God. The following example is illustrative: "I conjure you by <a href="Yahweh">Iaō</a> <a href="Sabaoth">Sabaōth</a> <a href="Adonai">Adōnai</a> Abrasax, and by the great god, <a href="Yahweh">Iaeō</a>". The patriarchs are sometimes addressed as deities; for which fact many instances may be adduced. In the group "Iakoubia, Iaōsabaōth Adōnai Abrasax," the first name seems to be composed of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> and Ya. Similarly, entities considered angels in Judaism are invoked as gods alongside Abrasax: thus "I conjure you... by the god <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Michaēl</a>, by the god <a href="Sariel">Souriēl</a>, by the god <a href="Gabriel">Gabriēl</a>, by the god <a href="Raphael%20%28archangel%29">Raphaēl</a>, by the god Abrasax Ablathanalba Akrammachari...".

In text PGM V. 96-172, Abrasax is identified as part of the "true name which has been transmitted to the prophets of Israel" of the "Headless One, who created heaven and earth, who created night and day... Osoronnophris whom none has ever seen... awesome and invisible god with an empty spirit"; the name also includes Iaō and Adōnai. "Osoronnophris" represents Egyptian "<a href="Osiris%23Etymology%20of%20the%20name">Wsir</a> <a href="wikt%3Awnn-nfr%23Egyptian">Wn-nfr</a>", "<a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> the Perfect Being". Another identification with Osiris is made in PGM VII. 643-51: "you are not wine, but the guts of Osiris, the guts of... Ablanathanalba Akrammachamarei Eee, who has been stationed over necessity, Iakoub Ia Iaō Sabaōth Adōnai Abrasax." PGM VIII. 1-63, on the other hand, identifies Abrasax as a name of "<a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>" (i.e. <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>). Here the numerological properties of the name are invoked, with its seven letters corresponding to the seven planets and its <a href="isopsephy">isopsephic</a> value of 365 corresponding to the days of the year. Thoth is also identified with Abrasax in PGM LXXIX. 1-7: "I am the soul of darkness, Abrasax, the eternal one, Michaēl, but my true name is Thōouth, Thōouth."

One papyrus titled the "Monad" or the "Eighth pageRank.Book of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>" (PGM XIII. 1-343) contains an invocation to a supreme creator God; Abrasax is given as being the name of this God in the language of the baboons. The papyrus goes on to describe a cosmogonic myth about Abrasax, describing how he created the <a href="Ogdoad%20%28Gnosticism%29">Ogdoad</a> by laughing. His first laughter created light; his second divided the <a href="Nu%20%28mythology%29">primordial waters</a>; his third created the mind; his fourth created fertility and procreation; his fifth created fate; his sixth created time (as the sun and moon); and his seventh and final laughter created the soul. Then, from various sounds made by Abrasax, there arose the serpent <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a> who "foreknew all things", the first man (or <a href="Phobos%20%28mythology%29">Fear</a>), and the god <a href="Yahweh">Iaō</a>, "who is lord of all". The man fought with Iaō, and Abrasax declared that Iaō's power would derive from both of the others, and that Iaō would take precedence over all the other gods. This text also describes <a href="Helios">Helios</a> as an archangel of God/Abrasax.

The <a href="Leyden%20papyrus%20X">Leyden Papyrus</a> recommends that this invocation be pronounced to the moon:
The magic word "Ablanathanalba," which reads in Greek <a href="Palindrome">the same backward as forward</a>, also occurs in the Abrasax-stones as well as in the magic papyri. This word is usually conceded to be derived from the Hebrew (Aramaic), meaning "Thou art our father" (אב לן את), and also occurs in connection with Abrasax; the following inscription is found upon a metal plate in the Carlsruhe Museum:

АВРАΣАΞ<br>
ΑΒΛΑΝΑΘ<br>
ΑΝΑΛΒΑ

<a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Gaius Julius Hyginus</a> ("Fab". 183) gives "Abrax Aslo Therbeeo" as names of horses of the sun mentioned by '<a href="Homer">Homer</a>us.' The passage is miserably corrupt: but it may not be accidental that the first three syllables make Abraxas.

The proper form of the name is evidently "Abrasax", as with the Greek writers, Hippolytus, Epiphanias, Didymus ("De Trin". iii. 42), and Theodoret; also <a href="Augustine">Augustine</a> and 'Praedestinatus'; and in nearly all the legends on gems. By a probably euphonic inversion the translator of Irenaeus and the other Latin authors have "Abraxas", which is found in the magical papyri, and even, though most sparingly, on engraved stones.

The attempts to discover a derivation for the name, Greek, Hebrew, Coptic, or other, have not been entirely successful:




Perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious expressions discussed by <a href="Adolf%20von%20Harnack">Adolf von Harnack</a>, “which belong to no known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine inspiration.”

Yet we may with better reason suppose that it came originally from a foreign mythology, and that the accident of its numerical value in Greek merely caused it to be singled out at Alexandria for religious use. It is worth notice that <a href="Mithras">ΜΕΙΘΡΑΣ</a> and <a href="Nile">ΝΕΙΛΟΣ</a> have the same value. The Egyptian author of the book "<a href="De%20Mysteriis%20Aegyptiorum">De Mysteriis</a>" in reply to <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a> (vii. 4) admits a preference of 'barbarous' to vernacular names in sacred things, urging a peculiar sanctity in the languages of certain nations, as the Egyptians and <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrians</a>; and Origen ("Contra Cels". i. 24) refers to the 'potent names' used by Egyptian sages, <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n <a href="Magi">Magi</a>, and Indian <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s, signifying deities in the several languages.

Absalom

Absalom or Avshalom () according to the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> was the third son of <a href="David%20%28biblical%20king%29">David</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28united%20monarchy%29">King of Israel</a> with <a href="Maachah">Maachah</a>, daughter of <a href="Talmai">Talmai</a>, King of <a href="Geshur">Geshur</a>.

Absalom, David's third son, by Maacah, was born in <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a>, and moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, and insinuating ways, together with his love of pomp and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot and had fifty men run before him.

Little is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, whose name was also Tamar. From the language of , "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance", it is inferred that his sons died at an early age.

Absalom's sister <a href="Tamar%20%282%20Samuel%29">Tamar</a> was raped by <a href="Amnon">Amnon</a>, who was their half-brother. Amnon was also David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years, and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast, to which Absalom had invited all the king's sons ().

After this murder Absalom fled to <a href="Talmai">Talmai</a>, who was the king of <a href="Geshur">Geshur</a> and Absalom's maternal grandfather (see also or ). It was not until three years later that Absalom was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem (see <a href="Joab">Joab</a>).

While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you", perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the United Monarchy. "If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice." He made gestures of humility by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He "stole the hearts of the people of Israel".

After four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at <a href="Hebron">Hebron</a>, the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines. All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the <a href="Cherethites">Cherethites</a> and <a href="Pelethites">Pelethites</a> and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned <a href="Ahithophel">Ahithophel</a> (sometimes spelled Achitophel).

David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, <a href="Hushai">Hushai</a>, to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the coming battle.

A fateful <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wood%20of%20Ephraim">battle</a> was fought in the <a href="Wood%20of%20Ephraim">Wood of Ephraim</a> (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed. Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to <a href="Joab">Joab</a>, the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom. Absalom once had Joab's field set on fire and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command, "Beware that none touch the young man Absalom". Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart.

When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.
David withdrew to the city (<a href="Mahanaim">Mahanaim</a>) in mourning, until Joab roused him from "the extravagance of his grief" and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people.

Absalom had erected a monument near <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to perpetuate his name:

Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's monument.

This is now the monument known as the Pillar or <a href="Tomb%20of%20Absalom">Tomb of Absalom</a>, which is dated to the first century AD.





"Avshalom" (אבשלום), the original Hebrew form, is commonly used as a male first name in contemporary <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Other variants, used either as a first name or a surname, include "Absalom", "<a href="Absolon%20%28surname%29">Absolon</a>", "<a href="Avessalom">Avessalom</a>", "<a href="Avesalom">Avesalom</a>", "<a href="Absalon">Absalon</a>", and "<a href="Absolom%20%28name%29">Absolom</a>".

Abydos, Egypt

Abydos is one of the oldest cities of <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, and also of the eighth <a href="Nome%20%28Egypt%29">nome</a> in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, of which it was the capital city. It is located about west of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> at latitude 26° 10' N, near the modern Egyptian towns of <a href="el-%27Araba%20el%20Madfuna">el-'Araba el Madfuna</a> and <a href="al-Balyana">al-Balyana</a>. In the ancient <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a>, the city was called Abdju ("ꜣbdw" or "AbDw"). The English name "Abydos" comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> , a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Hellespont">Abydos</a> on the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>.

Considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt, the sacred city of Abydos was the site of many ancient <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a>, including <a href="Umm%20el-Qa%27ab">Umm el-Qa'ab</a>, a royal <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a> where early <a href="pharaohs">pharaohs</a> were entombed. These tombs began to be seen as extremely significant burials and in later times it became desirable to be buried in the area, leading to the growth of the town's importance as a cult site.

Today, Abydos is notable for the <a href="Temple%20of%20Seti%20I">memorial temple</a> of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a>, which contains an inscription from the nineteenth dynasty known to the modern world as the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>. It is a chronological list showing <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a>s of most dynastic <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s of Egypt from <a href="Menes">Menes</a> until Seti I's father, <a href="Ramesses%20I">Ramesses I</a>.

The Great Temple and most of the <a href="Kom%20el-Sultan">ancient town</a> are buried under the modern buildings to the north of the Seti temple. Many of the original structures and the artifacts within them are considered irretrievable and lost; many may have been destroyed by the new construction.

Abydos was occupied by the rulers of the <a href="Predynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Predynastic period</a>, whose town, temple and tombs have been found there. The temple and town continued to be rebuilt at intervals down to the times of the <a href="Thirtieth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">thirtieth dynasty</a>, and the cemetery was used continuously.

The pharaohs of the <a href="First%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">first dynasty</a> were buried in Abydos, including <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a>, who is regarded as founder of the first dynasty, and his successor, <a href="Hor-Aha">Aha</a>. It was in this time period that the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20Boats%20%28First%20Dynasty%29%20%E2%80%93%20Abydos">Abydos boats</a> were constructed. Some pharaohs of the second dynasty were also buried in Abydos. The temple was renewed and enlarged by these pharaohs as well. Funerary enclosures, misinterpreted in modern times as great 'forts', were built on the desert behind the town by three kings of the <a href="Second%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">second dynasty</a>; the most complete is that of <a href="Khasekhemwy">Khasekhemwy</a>.

From the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">fifth dynasty</a>, the deity <a href="Khenti-Amentiu">Khentiamentiu</a>, "foremost of the Westerners", came to be seen as a manifestation of the dead pharaoh in the underworld. <a href="Pepi%20I">Pepi I</a> (<a href="Sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">sixth dynasty</a>) constructed a funerary chapel which evolved over the years into the Great Temple of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, the ruins of which still exist within the town enclosure. Abydos became the centre of the worship of the <a href="Isis">Isis</a> and Osiris cult.

During the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a>, the principal deity of the area, Khentiamentiu, began to be seen as an aspect of Osiris, and the deities gradually merged and came to be regarded as one. Khentiamentiu's name became an <a href="epithet">epithet</a> of Osiris. King <a href="Mentuhotep%20II">Mentuhotep II</a> was the first one building a <a href="Mahat%20chapel%20of%20Nebhetepre%20Mentuhotep%20II">royal chapel</a>. In the <a href="twelfth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">twelfth dynasty</a> a gigantic tomb was cut into the rock by <a href="Senusret%20III">Senusret III</a>. Associated with this tomb was a "cenotaph", a cult temple and a small town known as "<a href="Wah-Sut">Wah-Sut</a>", that was used by the workers for these structures. Next to that cenotaph were buried at least two kings of the <a href="Thirteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">thirteenth dynasty</a> (in tombs <a href="S%209%20%28Abydos%29">S9</a> and <a href="S%2010%20%28Abydos%29">S10</a>) and some rulers of the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period">Second Intermediate Period</a>, such as <a href="Senebkay">Senebkay</a>. An indigenous line of kings, the <a href="Abydos%20Dynasty">Abydos Dynasty</a>, may have ruled the region from Abydos at the time.

The building during the <a href="Eighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">eighteenth dynasty</a> began with a large chapel of <a href="Ahmose%20I">Ahmose I</a>. The <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Ahmose">Pyramid of Ahmose</a> I was also constructed at Abydos—the only pyramid in the area; very little of it remains today.

<a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> built a far larger temple, about . He also made a processional way leading past the side of the temple to the cemetery beyond, featuring a great gateway of granite.

<a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a>, in the <a href="Nineteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">nineteenth dynasty</a>, <a href="Temple%20of%20Seti%20I">founded a temple</a> to the south of the town in honor of the ancestral pharaohs of the early dynasties; this was finished by <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>, who also built a lesser temple of his own. <a href="Merneptah">Merneptah</a> added the <a href="Osireion">Osireion</a> just to the north of the temple of Seti.

<a href="Ahmose%20II">Ahmose II</a> in the twenty-sixth dynasty rebuilt the temple again, and placed in it a large monolith shrine of red granite, finely wrought. The foundations of the successive temples were comprised within approximately . depth of the ruins discovered in modern times; these needed the closest examination to discriminate the various buildings, and were recorded by more than 4,000 measurements and 1,000 levellings.

The latest building was a new temple of <a href="Nectanebo%20I">Nectanebo I</a>, built in the thirtieth dynasty. From the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Period">Ptolemaic</a> times of the Greek occupancy of Egypt, that began three hundred years before the Roman occupancy that followed, the structure began to decay and no later works are known.

From earliest times, Abydos was a cult centre, first of the local deity, Khentiamentiu, and from the end of the Old Kingdom, the rising cult of Osiris and Isis.

A tradition developed that the <a href="Umm%20el-Qa%27ab">Early Dynastic cemetery</a> was the burial place of Osiris and the tomb of <a href="Djer">Djer</a> was reinterpreted as that of Osiris.

Decorations in tombs throughout Egypt, such as the one displayed to the right, record journeys to and from Abydos, as important pilgrimages made by individuals who were proud to have been able to make the vital trip.

Successively from the first dynasty to the <a href="twenty-sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">twenty-sixth dynasty</a>, nine or ten temples were built on one site at Abydos. The first was an enclosure, about , surrounded by a thin wall of unbaked bricks. Incorporating one wall of this first structure, the second temple of about square was built within a wall about thick. An outer "temenos" (enclosure) wall surrounded the grounds. This outer wall was thickened about the second or <a href="Third%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">third dynasty</a>. The old temple entirely vanished in the fourth dynasty, and a smaller building was erected behind it, enclosing a wide hearth of black ashes. Pottery models of offerings are found in these ashes and probably were the substitutes for live sacrifices decreed by <a href="Khufu%20%28pharaoh%29">Khufu</a> (or Cheops) in his temple reforms.

At an undetermined date, a great clearance of temple offerings had been made and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. A vase of <a href="Menes">Menes</a> with purple <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures are the most important pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.

The temple was rebuilt entirely on a larger scale by <a href="Pepi%20I%20Meryre">Pepi I</a> in the <a href="Sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">sixth dynasty</a>. He placed a great stone gateway to the temenos, an outer temenos wall and gateway, with a colonnade between the gates. His temple was about inside, with stone gateways front and back, showing that it was of the processional type. In the <a href="Eleventh%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">eleventh dynasty</a> <a href="Mentuhotep%20I">Mentuhotep I</a> added a colonnade and altars. Soon after, <a href="Mentuhotep%20II">Mentuhotep II</a> entirely rebuilt the temple, laying a stone pavement over the area, about square, and added subsidiary chambers. Soon thereafter in the twelfth dynasty, <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> laid massive foundations of stone over the pavement of his predecessor. A great temenos was laid out enclosing a much larger area and the new temple itself was about three times the earlier size.

The temple of Seti I was built on entirely new ground half a mile to the south of the long series of temples just described. This surviving building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king Seti I, as well as reverence of the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the "Rite of the Ancestors". The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties—recognized by Seti—are carved on a wall and known as the "<a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>" (showing the <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a> name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a> or <a href="Menes">Menes</a>, until his time)- with the exception of those noted above. There were significant names deliberately left out of the list. So rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, re-discovered by <a href="William%20John%20Bankes">William John Bankes</a>, has been called the "Rosetta Stone" of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> for Egyptian writing, beyond the <a href="Narmer%20Palette">Narmer Palette</a>.

There also were seven chapels built for the worship of the pharaoh and principal deities, being the "state" deities Ptah, Re-Horakhty, and (centrally positioned) Amun-Re; the remaining three chapels are dedicated to the Abydos triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. The rites recorded in the deity chapels represent the first complete form of the Daily Ritual, which was performed throughout temples daily in Egypt throughout the pharaonic period. At the back of the temple is an enigmatic structure known as the <a href="Osireion">Osireion</a>, which served as a cenotaph for Seti-Osiris, and is thought to be connected with the worship of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> as an "Osiris tomb". It is possible that from those chambers led out the great Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, built by Merenptah. The temple was originally long, but the forecourts are scarcely recognizable, and the part still in good condition is about

Except for the list of pharaohs and a <a href="panegyric">panegyric</a> on <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>, the subjects are not historical, but religious in nature, dedicated to the transformation of the king after his death. The temple reliefs are celebrated for their delicacy and artistic refinement, utilizing both the archaism of earlier dynasties with the vibrancy of late 18th Dynasty reliefs. The sculptures had been published mostly in hand copy, not facsimile, by <a href="Auguste%20Mariette">Auguste Mariette</a> in his "Abydos", I. The temple has been partially recorded epigraphically by Amice Calverley and Myrtle Broome in their 4 volume publication of "The Temple of King Sethos I at Abydos" (1933–1958).

The adjacent temple of Ramesses II was much smaller and simpler in plan; but it had a fine historical series of scenes around the outside that lauded his achievements, of which the lower parts remain. The outside of the temple was decorated with scenes of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kadesh">Battle of Kadesh</a>. His list of pharaohs, similar to that of Seti I, formerly stood here; but the fragments were removed by the French consul and sold to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

The Royal necropolis of the earliest dynasties were placed about a mile into the great desert plain, in a place now known as <a href="Umm%20el-Qa%27ab">Umm el-Qa'ab</a>, "The Mother of Pots", because of the shards remaining from all of the devotional objects left by religious pilgrims. The earliest burial is about inside, a pit lined with brick walls, and originally roofed with timber and matting. Others also built before Menes are . The probable tomb of Menes is of the latter size. Afterward the tombs increase in size and complexity. The tomb-pit is surrounded by chambers to hold offerings, the <a href="sepulchre">sepulchre</a> being a great wooden chamber in the midst of the brick-lined pit. Rows of small pits, tombs for the servants of the pharaoh surround the royal chamber, many dozens of such burials being usual. Some of the offerings included sacrificed animals, such as the asses found in the tomb of <a href="Merneith">Merneith</a>. Evidence of human sacrifices exists in the early tombs, but this practice was changed into symbolic offerings later.

By the end of the second dynasty the type of tomb constructed changed to a long passage bordered with chambers on either side, the royal burial being in the middle of the length. The greatest of these tombs with its dependencies, covered a space of over , however it is possible for this to be several tombs which have met in the making of a tomb; the Egyptians had no means of mapping the positioning of the tombs. The contents of the tombs have been nearly destroyed by successive plunderers; but enough remained to show that rich jewellery was placed on the mummies, a profusion of vases of hard and valuable stones from the royal table service stood about the body, the store-rooms were filled with great jars of wine, perfumed ointments, and other supplies, and tablets of ivory and of ebony were engraved with a record of the yearly annals of the reigns. The seals of various officials, of which over 200 varieties have been found, give an insight into the public arrangements.

The cemetery of private persons began during the first dynasty with some pit-tombs in the town. It was extensive in the twelfth and thirteenth dynasties and contained many rich tombs. A large number of fine tombs were made in the eighteenth to twentieth dynasties, and members of later dynasties continued to bury their dead here until Roman times. Many hundreds of funeral steles were removed by Mariette's workmen, without any record of the burials being made. Later excavations have been recorded by <a href="Edward%20R.%20Ayrton">Edward R. Ayrton</a>, Abydos, iii.; Maclver, "El Amrah and Abydos"; and <a href="Garstang">Garstang</a>, "El Arabah".

Some of the tomb structures, referred to as "forts" by modern researchers, lay behind the town. Known as <a href="Shunet%20ez%20Zebib">Shunet ez Zebib</a>, it is about over all, and one still stands high. It was built by <a href="Khasekhemwy">Khasekhemwy</a>, the last pharaoh of the second dynasty. Another structure nearly as large adjoined it, and probably is older than that of Khasekhemwy. A third "fort" of a squarer form is now occupied by a convent of the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria</a>; its age cannot be ascertained.

Some of the hieroglyphs carved over an arch on the site have been interpreted in esoteric and "ufological" circles as depicting modern technology.

The carvings are often thought to be a helicopter, a battle tank or submarine, and a fighter plane (some interpret this as a <a href="U.F.O.">U.F.O.</a>) However, these conjectures are largely based in <a href="pseudoarchaeology">pseudoarchaeology</a>, and the picture often claimed as "evidence" has been retouched (see right).

Abydos (Hellespont)

Abydos () or Abydus, was an ancient city and bishopric in <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. It was located on the coast of the <a href="Dardanelles">Hellespont</a>.

In Greek mythology, Abydos is presented in the myth of <a href="Hero%20and%20Leander">Hero and Leander</a> as the home of Leander. The city is also mentioned in "Rodanthe and Dosikles", a novel written by <a href="Theodore%20Prodromos">Theodore Prodromos</a>, a 12th century writer, in which Dosikles kidnaps Rodanthe at Abydos.

Abydos is mentioned in the <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a> as a <a href="Troy">Trojan</a> ally, and, according to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, was occupied by <a href="Thrace">Thracians</a> after the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>. Abydos was settled by <a href="Miletus">Milesian</a> colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of <a href="Karabiga">Priapos</a> and <a href="Marmara%20Island">Prokonnesos</a> in c. 670 BC. Strabo related that <a href="Gyges%20of%20Lydia">Gyges</a>, King of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> granted his consent to the Milesians to settle Abydos. Abydos was ruled by Daphnis, a pro-Persian tyrant, in the 520s, but was occupied by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> in 514. <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a> destroyed the city following his <a href="European%20Scythian%20campaign%20of%20Darius%20I">Scythian campaign</a> in 512. In 480, at the onset of the <a href="Second%20Persian%20invasion%20of%20Greece">Second Persian invasion of Greece</a>, <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> and the Persian army passed through Abydos on its march to Greece.

After the failed Persian invasion, Abydos became a member of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a>, and was part of the <a href="Members%20of%20the%20Delian%20League%23Hellespontine%20phoros">Hellespontine district</a>. Ostensibly an ally, Abydos was hostile to Athens throughout this time. During the <a href="Second%20Peloponnesian%20War">Second Peloponnesian War</a>, a Spartan expedition led by <a href="Dercylidas">Dercylidas</a> arrived at Abydos in early May 411 and successfully convinced the city to defect from the Delian League and fight against Athens, at which time he was made "<a href="harmost">harmost</a>" (commander/governor) of Abydos. Abydos was attacked by the Athenians in the winter of 409/408 BC, but was repelled by a Persian force led by <a href="Pharnabazus%20II">Pharnabazus</a>, "<a href="satrap">satrap</a>" (governor) of <a href="Hellespontine%20Phrygia">Hellespontine Phrygia</a>. Dercylidas held the office of "harmost" of Abydos until at least c. 407.

According to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, Abydos held an oligarchic constitution at this time. At the beginning of the <a href="Corinthian%20War">Corinthian War</a> in 394 BC, <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus</a>, King of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>, passed through Abydos into Thrace. Abydos remained an ally of Sparta throughout the war and Dercylidas served as "harmost" of the city from 394 until he was replaced by <a href="Anaxibius">Anaxibius</a> in c. 390, who was killed in an ambush near Abydos by the Athenian general <a href="Iphicrates">Iphicrates</a> in c. 389/388. At the conclusion of the Corinthian War, under the terms of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Antalcidas">Peace of Antalcidas</a> in 387 BC, Abydos was annexed to the Persian Empire.

In c. 360, the city came under the control of the tyrant Iphiades. Abydos remained under Persian control until it was seized by a Macedonian army led by <a href="Parmenion">Parmenion</a>, a general of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, in the spring of 336 BC. In 335, whilst Parmenion besieged the city of <a href="Pitane%20%28Aeolis%29">Pitane</a>, Abydos was besieged by a Persian army led by <a href="Memnon%20of%20Rhodes">Memnon of Rhodes</a>, forcing Parmenion to abandon his siege of Pitane and march north to relieve Abydos. Alexander ferried across from Sestos to Abydos in 334 and travelled south to the city of Troy, after which he returned to Abydos. The following day, Alexander left Abydos and led his army north to <a href="Percote">Percote</a>. Alexander later established a royal mint at Abydos, as well as at other cities in Asia Minor.

In 302, during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi%23Fourth%20War%20of%20the%20Diadochi">Fourth War of the Diadochi</a>, <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a>, King of Thrace, crossed over into Anatolia and invaded the Kingdom of <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus I</a>. Unlike the neighbouring cities of <a href="Parium">Parium</a> and <a href="Lampsacus">Lampsacus</a> which surrendered, Abydos resisted Lysimachus and was besieged. Lysimachus was forced to abandon the siege, however, after the arrival of a relief force sent by <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius</a>, son of King Antigonus I.

During the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>, Abydos was besieged by <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V</a>, King of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a>, in 200 BC, during which many of its citizens chose to commit suicide rather than surrender. Ultimately, the city was forced to surrender to Philip V due to a lack of reinforcements. The Macedonian occupation ended after the Peace of Flamininus at the end of the war in 196 BC. At this time, Abydos was substantially depopulated and partially ruined as a result of the Macedonian occupation. In the spring of 196 BC, Abydos was seized by <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III</a>, "<a href="Basileus">Megas Basileus</a>" of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, who refortified the city in 192/191 BC.

Under the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the city was administered by an "komes ton Stenon" (count of the straits) or an "<a href="archon%23Byzantine%20Empire">archon</a>", and was the centre for customs collection at the southern entrance of the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. In the 6th century AD, Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> introduced the office of "komes" with responsibility for collecting customs duty in Abydos.

As a result of the administrative reforms of the 7th century, Abydos came to be administered as part of the <a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">theme</a> of <a href="Opsikion">Opsikion</a>. The office of "<a href="kommerkiarios">kommerkiarios</a>" of Abydos is first attested in the mid-7th century, and was later sometimes combined with the office of "<a href="paraphylax">paraphylax</a>", the military governor of the fort, introduced in the 8th century, at which time the office of "komes ton stenon" is last mentioned.

After the 7th century AD, Abydos became a major seaport. <a href="Maslama%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik</a>, during his campaign against Constantinople, crossed over into Thrace at Abydos in July 717. In 801, Empress <a href="Irene%20of%20Athens">Irene</a> reduced commercial tariffs collected at Abydos. Emperor <a href="Nikephoros%20I">Nikephoros I</a>, Irene's successor, introduced a tax on slaves purchased beyond the city. The city later also became part of the theme of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea%20%28theme%29">Aegean Sea</a> and was the seat of a "<a href="Turma">tourmarches</a>" (commander of a tourma). In the early 11th century, Abydos became the seat of a separate command and the office of "<a href="strategos">strategos</a>" (governor) of Abydos is first mentioned in 1004 with authority over the northern shore of the Hellespont and the islands of the Sea of Marmara.

Abydos was sacked by an <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Arab</a> fleet led by <a href="Leo%20of%20Tripoli">Leo of Tripoli</a> in 904 AD whilst en route to Constantinople. The revolt of <a href="Bardas%20Phokas%20the%20Younger">Bardas Phokas</a> was defeated by Emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> at the Battle of Abydos in 989 AD. In 992, Venetians were granted reduced commercial tariffs at Abydos as a special privilege. In 1024, a <a href="Rus%27%20people">Rus'</a> raid led by a certain <a href="Battle%20of%20Lemnos%20%281024%29">Chrysocheir</a> defeated the local commander at Abydos and proceeded to travel south through the Hellespont. Following the defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a>, Abydos was seized by the Turks but was recovered in 1086 AD. In 1092/1093, the city was attacked by <a href="Tzachas">Tzachas</a>, a Turkish pirate. Emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Komnenos">Manuel I Komnenos</a> repaired Abydos' fortifications in the late 12th century.

By the 13th century AD, the crossing from Lampsacus to <a href="Gelibolu">Kallipolis</a> had become more common and largely replaced the crossing from Abydos to Sestos. During the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>, in 1204, Venetians seized Abydos, and, following the <a href="Sack%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">Fall of Constantinople</a> and the formation of the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a> later that year, <a href="Baldwin%20I%2C%20Latin%20Emperor">Emperor Baldwin</a> granted the land between Abydos to <a href="Adramyttium">Adramyttium</a> to his brother <a href="Henry%20of%20Flanders">Henry of Flanders</a>. Henry of Flanders passed through Abydos on 11 November 1204 and continued his march to Adramyttium. Abydos was seized by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Empire of Nicaea</a>, a successor state of the Eastern Roman Empire, during its offensive in 1206-1207, but was reconquered by the Latin Empire in 1212-1213. The city was later recovered by Emperor <a href="John%20III%20Vatatzes">John III Vatatzes</a>. Abydos later fell to the Turks in the 14th century.

The <a href="bishopric">bishopric</a> of Abydus in the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Hellespontus%20%28province%29">Hellespontus</a> appears in all the "<a href="Notitiae%20Episcopatuum">Notitiae Episcopatuum</a>" of the <a href="Patriarchate%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarchate of Constantinople</a> from the mid-7th century until the time of <a href="Andronicus%20III">Andronicus III</a> (1341), first as a <a href="suffragan">suffragan</a> of <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> and then from 1084 as a <a href="metropolitan%20see">metropolitan see</a> without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcianus, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor <a href="Leo%20I%20the%20Thracian">Leo I the Thracian</a> in 458, protesting about the murder of <a href="Proterius%20of%20Alexandria">Proterius of Alexandria</a>. A letter of <a href="Peter%20the%20Fuller">Peter the Fuller</a> (471–488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against <a href="Severus%20of%20Antioch">Severus of Antioch</a> and others. Isidorus was at the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Third Council of Constantinople</a> (680–681), Ioannes at the <a href="Trullan%20Council">Trullan Council</a> (692), Theodorus at the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Second Council of Nicaea</a> (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor <a href="Nicephorus%20II">Nicephorus II</a> in 969. Abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the Turks in the 14th century.

In c. 1220, during the Latin occupation, the dioceses of Abydos and <a href="Madytos%20%28Thrace%29">Madytos</a> were united and placed under direct Papal authority. No longer a residential <a href="bishopric">bishopric</a>, Abydus is today listed by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> as a <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a>.

Acacia sensu lato

Acacia <a href="sensu%20lato">s.l.</a> ( or ), known commonly as mimosa, acacia, thorntree or wattle, is a <a href="Polyphyly">polyphyletic</a> genus of shrubs and trees belonging to the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Mimosoideae">Mimosoideae</a> of the family <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a>. It was described by the <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> botanist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1773 based on the <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n species "<a href="Acacia%20nilotica">Acacia nilotica</a>". Many non-Australian species tend to be <a href="Thorns%2C%20spines%20and%20prickles">thorny</a>, whereas the majority of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n acacias are not. All species are <a href="Legume">pod</a>-bearing, with sap and leaves often bearing large amounts of <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s and <a href="condensed%20tannin">condensed tannin</a>s that historically found use as pharmaceuticals and preservatives.

The genus "Acacia" constitutes, in its traditional circumspection, the second largest genus in Fabaceae ("<a href="Astragalus">Astragalus</a>" being the largest), with roughly 1,300 <a href="species">species</a>, about 960 of them native to Australia, with the remainder spread around the tropical to warm-<a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions of both hemispheres, including <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, Africa, southern <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, and the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> (see <a href="list%20of%20Acacia%20species">List of "Acacia" species</a>). The genus was divided into five separate genera under the tribe "<a href="Acacieae">Acacieae</a>". The genus now called "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" represents the majority of the Australian species and a few native to southeast Asia, <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, and <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific Islands</a>. Most of the species outside Australia, and a small number of Australian species, are classified into "<a href="Vachellia">Vachellia</a>" and "<a href="Senegalia">Senegalia</a>". The two final genera, "<a href="Acaciella">Acaciella</a>" and "<a href="Mariosousa">Mariosousa</a>", each contain about a dozen species from the Americas (but see "<a href="%23Classification">Classification</a>" below for the ongoing debate concerning their taxonomy).

This article describes acacias in the broader sense.

English botanist and gardener <a href="Philip%20Miller">Philip Miller</a> adopted the name "Acacia" in 1754. The generic name is derived from (), the name given by early Greek botanist-physician <a href="Pedanius%20Dioscorides">Pedanius Dioscorides</a> (middle to late first century) to the medicinal tree "<a href="Acacia%20nilotica">A. nilotica</a>" in his book "<a href="Materia%20medica">Materia Medica</a>". This name derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word for its characteristic thorns, (; "thorn"). The species name "nilotica" was given by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> from this tree's best-known range along the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> river. This became the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus.

The traditional circumscription of "Acacia" eventually contained approximately 1,300 species. However, evidence began to accumulate that the genus as described was not <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>. Queensland botanist Les Pedley proposed the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Phyllodineae" be renamed "Racosperma" and published the binomial names. This was taken up in New Zealand but generally not followed in Australia, where botanists declared more study was needed.
Eventually, consensus emerged that "Acacia" needed to be split as it was not monophyletic. This led to Australian botanists <a href="Bruce%20Maslin">Bruce Maslin</a> and Tony Orchard pushing for the retypification of the genus with an Australian species instead of the original African type species, an exception to traditional rules of priority that required ratification by the International Botanical Congress. That decision has been controversial, and debate continued, with some taxonomists (and many other biologists) deciding to continue to use the traditional "Acacia sensu lato" circumscription of the genus, in defiance of decisions by an International Botanical Congress. However, a second International Botanical Congress has now confirmed the decision to apply the name "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" to the mostly Australian plants, which some had been calling "Racosperma", and which had formed the overwhelming majority of "Acacia sensu lato". Debate continues regarding the traditional acacias of Africa, possibly placed in "<a href="Senegalia">Senegalia</a>" and "<a href="Vachellia">Vachellia</a>", and some of the American species, possibly placed in "<a href="Acaciella">Acaciella</a>" and "<a href="Mariosousa">Mariosousa</a>".

Acacias belong to the subfamily <a href="Mimosoideae">Mimosoideae</a>, the major clades of which may have formed in response to <a href="Desiccation%20tolerance">drying</a> trends and <a href="fire%20regime">fire regime</a>s that accompanied increased seasonality during the late <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> to early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (∼25 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>). Pedley (1978), following Vassal (1972), viewed Acacia as comprising three large subgenera, but subsequently (1986) raised the rank of these groups to genera Acacia, "<a href="Senegalia">Senegalia</a>" ("s.l.") and "Racosperma", which was underpinned by later genetic studies.

In common parlance, the term "acacia" is occasionally applied to species of the genus "<a href="Robinia">Robinia</a>", which also belongs in the <a href="pea">pea</a> family. "<a href="Robinia%20pseudoacacia">Robinia pseudoacacia</a>", an American species locally known as black locust, is sometimes called "false acacia" in <a href="Plant%20cultivation">cultivation</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and throughout Europe.

The leaves of acacias are compound <a href="pinnate">pinnate</a> in general. In some species, however, more especially in the Australian and <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific Islands</a> species, the leaflets are suppressed, and the leaf-stalks (<a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a>) become vertically flattened in order to serve the purpose of leaves. These are known as "<a href="phyllode">phyllode</a>s". The vertical orientation of the phyllodes protects them from intense sunlight since with their edges towards the sky and earth they do not intercept light as fully as horizontally placed leaves. A few species (such as "<a href="Acacia%20glaucoptera">Acacia glaucoptera</a>") lack leaves or phyllodes altogether but instead possess <a href="wikt%3Acladode">cladodes</a>, modified leaf-like <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> stems functioning as leaves.

The small flowers have five very small petals, almost hidden by the long <a href="stamens">stamens</a>, and are arranged in dense, globular or cylindrical clusters; they are yellow or cream-colored in most species, whitish in some, or even purple ("Acacia purpureopetala") or red (<a href="Acacia%20leprosa%20%27Scarlet%20Blaze%27">"Acacia leprosa" 'Scarlet Blaze'</a>). "Acacia" flowers can be distinguished from those of a large related genus, "<a href="Albizia">Albizia</a>", by their stamens, which are not joined at the base. Also, unlike individual "<a href="Mimosa">Mimosa</a>" flowers, those of "Acacia" have more than ten stamens.

The plants often bear spines, especially those species growing in arid regions. These sometimes represent branches that have become short, hard, and pungent, though they sometimes represent leaf-<a href="stipule">stipule</a>s. "<a href="Acacia%20armata">Acacia armata</a>" is the kangaroo-thorn of Australia, and "<a href="Acacia%20erioloba">Acacia erioloba</a>" (syn. "Acacia eriolobata") is the camelthorn of Africa.

Acacia seeds can be difficult to germinate. Research has found that immersing the seeds in various temperatures (usually around 80 °C (176 °F)) and manual seed coat chipping can improve growth to around 80%.

In the <a href="Central%20American">Central American</a> bullthorn acacias—"<a href="Acacia%20sphaerocephala">Acacia sphaerocephala</a>", "<a href="Acacia%20cornigera">Acacia cornigera</a>" and "<a href="Acacia%20collinsii">Acacia collinsii</a>" — some of the spiny stipules are large, swollen and hollow. These afford shelter for several species of "<a href="Pseudomyrmex">Pseudomyrmex</a>" ants, which feed on <a href="Extrafloral%20nectary">extrafloral nectaries</a> on the leaf-stalk and small <a href="lipid">lipid</a>-rich food-bodies at the tips of the leaflets called <a href="Beltian%20body">Beltian bodies</a>. In return, the <a href="ant">ant</a>s add protection to the plant against <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s. Some species of ants will also remove competing plants around the acacia, cutting off the offending plants' leaves with their jaws and ultimately killing them. Other associated ant species appear to do nothing to benefit their hosts.

Similar mutualisms with ants occur on "Acacia" trees in Africa, such as the <a href="whistling%20thorn">whistling thorn</a> acacia. The acacias provide shelter for ants in similar swollen stipules and nectar in extrafloral nectaries for their symbiotic ants, such as "Crematogaster mimosae". In turn, the ants protect the plant by attacking large mammalian herbivores and stem-boring beetles that damage the plant.

The predominantly herbivorous spider "<a href="Bagheera%20kiplingi">Bagheera kiplingi</a>", which is found in Central America and Mexico, feeds on nubs at the tips of the acacia leaves, known as Beltian bodies, which contain high concentrations of protein. These nubs are produced by the acacia as part of a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ant, which also eat them.

In Australia, "Acacia" species are sometimes used as food plants by the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="Hepialidae">hepialid</a> <a href="moth">moth</a>s of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Aenetus">Aenetus</a>" including "A. ligniveren". These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Other <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> larvae which have been recorded feeding on "Acacia" include <a href="brown-tail">brown-tail</a>, "<a href="Endoclita">Endoclita malabaricus</a>" and <a href="turnip%20moth">turnip moth</a>. The leaf-mining larvae of some <a href="Bucculatricidae">bucculatricid</a> moths also feed on "Acacia"; "Bucculatrix agilis" feeds exclusively on "<a href="Acacia%20horrida">Acacia horrida</a>" and "Bucculatrix flexuosa" feeds exclusively on "<a href="Acacia%20nilotica">Acacia nilotica</a>".

Acacias contain a number of <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s that defend them from pests and grazing animals.

<a href="Acacia%20seed">Acacia seed</a>s are often used for food and a variety of other products.

In <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, the feathery shoots of "Acacia pennata" (common name "cha-om", ชะอม and "su pout ywet" in Burmese) are used in <a href="soups">soups</a>, <a href="curries">curries</a>, <a href="omelettes">omelettes</a>, and <a href="stir-fries">stir-fries</a>.

Various species of acacia yield gum. True <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a> is the product of "<a href="Acacia%20senegal">Acacia senegal</a>", abundant in dry tropical West Africa from <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> to northern <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>.

"<a href="Acacia%20nilotica">Acacia nilotica</a>" (syn. "Acacia arabica") is the gum arabic tree of <a href="India">India</a>, but yields a gum inferior to the true gum arabic. Gum arabic is used in a wide variety of food products, including some soft drinks and confections.

The ancient Egyptians used acacia gum in paints.

The gum of "<a href="Acacia%20xanthophloea">Acacia xanthophloea</a>" and "<a href="Acacia%20karroo">Acacia karroo</a>" has a high sugar content and is sought out by the <a href="lesser%20bushbaby">lesser bushbaby</a>. "Acacia karroo" gum was once used for making confectionery and traded under the name "Cape Gum". It was also used medicinally to treat cattle suffering poisoning by "<a href="Moraea">Moraea</a>" species.

"Acacia" species have possible uses in <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a>. A 19th-century Ethiopian medical text describes a potion made from an Ethiopian species (known as "grar") mixed with the root of the "tacha", then boiled, as a cure for <a href="rabies">rabies</a>.

An <a href="astringent">astringent</a> medicine high in <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s, called <a href="catechu">catechu</a> or cutch, is procured from several species, but more especially from "<a href="Senegalia%20catechu">Senegalia catechu</a>" (syn. "Acacia catechu"), by boiling down the wood and evaporating the solution so as to get an extract. The catechu extract from "A. catechu" figures in the history of chemistry in giving its name to the <a href="catechin">catechin</a>, <a href="catechol">catechol</a>, and <a href="catecholamine">catecholamine</a> chemical families ultimately derived from it.

A few species are widely grown as ornamentals in gardens; the most popular perhaps is "A. dealbata" (silver wattle), with its attractive glaucous to silvery leaves and bright yellow flowers; it is erroneously known as "mimosa" in some areas where it is cultivated, through confusion with the related genus "Mimosa".

Another ornamental acacia is the <a href="Acacia%20xanthophloea">fever tree</a>. Southern European florists use "A. baileyana", "A. dealbata", "A. pycnantha" and "A. retinodes" as cut flowers and the common name there for them is mimosa.

Ornamental species of acacias are also used by homeowners and <a href="landscape%20architect">landscape architect</a>s for home security. The sharp thorns of some species are a deterrent to trespassing, and may prevent break-ins if planted under windows and near drainpipes. The aesthetic characteristics of acacia plants, in conjunction with their home security qualities, makes them a reasonable alternative to constructed fences and walls.

"<a href="Acacia%20farnesiana">Acacia farnesiana</a>" is used in the <a href="perfume">perfume</a> industry due to its strong fragrance. The use of acacia as a fragrance dates back centuries.

Acacia also supposed to have been used for Zulu warriors' iziQu (or isiKu) beads, which passed on through Sir <a href="Robert%20Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell</a> to the Boy Scout movement's <a href="Wood%20Badge">Wood Badge</a> training award.

<a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian mythology</a> has associated the acacia tree with characteristics of the <a href="tree%20of%20life">tree of life</a>, such as in the <a href="Myth%20of%20Osiris%20and%20Isis">Myth of Osiris and Isis</a>.

Several parts (mainly bark, root, and resin) of "Acacia" species are used to make <a href="incense">incense</a> for rituals. Acacia is used in incense mainly in India, Nepal, and China including in its Tibet region. Smoke from acacia bark is thought to keep <a href="demon">demon</a>s and <a href="ghost">ghost</a>s away and to put the gods in a good mood. Roots and resin from acacia are combined with <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>, <a href="acorus">acorus</a>, <a href="cytisus">cytisus</a>, <a href="salvia">salvia</a>, and some other components of incense. Both people and elephants like an alcoholic beverage made from acacia fruit.
According to Easton's Bible Dictionary, the acacia tree may be the “burning bush” (<a href="pageRank.Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 3:2) which <a href="Moses">Moses</a> encountered in the desert. Also, when God gave Moses the instructions for building the <a href="Tabernacle">Tabernacle</a>, he said to "make an ark" and "a table of acacia wood" (Exodus 25:10 & 23, <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a>). Also, in the Christian tradition, Christ's crown of thorns is thought to have been woven from acacia.

In <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and other countries, it is customary to present women with yellow mimosas (among other flowers) on <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a> (March 8). These "mimosas" may be from "A. dealbata" (silver wattle).

The bark of various Australian species, known as wattles, is very rich in <a href="tannin">tannin</a> and forms an important article of export; important species include "<a href="Acacia%20pycnantha">A. pycnantha</a>" (golden wattle), "<a href="Acacia%20decurrens">A. decurrens</a>" (tan wattle), "A. dealbata" (silver wattle) and "A. mearnsii" (black wattle).

Black wattle is grown in plantations in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Most Australian "Acacia" species introduced to South Africa have become an enormous problem, due to their naturally aggressive propagation. The pods of "A. nilotica" (under the name of "neb-neb"), and of other African species, are also rich in tannin and used by <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanners</a>. In <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>, the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the salam-tree ("Acacia etbaica"), a tree known locally by the name "qaraẓ" ("garadh"). A bath solution of the crushed leaves of this tree, into which raw leather had been inserted for prolonged soaking, would take only 15 days for curing. The water and leaves, however, required changing after seven or eight days, and the leather needed to be turned over daily.

Some "Acacia" species are valuable as timber, such as "A. melanoxylon" (blackwood) from <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, which attains a great size; its wood is used for furniture, and takes a high polish; and "A. omalophylla" (myall wood, also Australian), which yields a fragrant timber used for ornaments. "<a href="Acacia%20seyal">A. seyal</a>" is thought to be the <a href="shittah-tree">shittah-tree</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, which supplied shittim-wood. According to the pageRank.Book of Exodus, this was used in the construction of the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>. "<a href="Acacia%20koa">A. koa</a>" from the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> and "<a href="Acacia%20heterophylla">A. heterophylla</a>" from <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> are both excellent timber trees. Depending on abundance and regional culture, some "Acacia" species (e.g. "A. fumosa") are traditionally used locally as firewoods. It is also used to make homes for different animals.

In <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (mainly in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>) and in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> (mainly in <a href="Sabah">Sabah</a>), plantations of "<a href="Acacia%20mangium">A. mangium</a>" are being established to supply <a href="pulpwood">pulpwood</a> to the paper industry.

Acacia wood pulp gives high opacity and below average bulk <a href="paper">paper</a>. This is suitable in <a href="Woodfree%20uncoated%20paper">lightweight offset papers</a> used for Bibles and dictionaries. It is also used in paper tissue where it improves softness.

Acacias can be planted for erosion control, especially after mining or construction damage.

For the same reasons it is favored as an erosion-control plant, with its easy spreading and resilience, some varieties of acacia are potentially invasive species. One of the most globally significant invasive acacias is black wattle "A. mearnsii", which is taking over grasslands and abandoned agricultural areas worldwide, especially in moderate coastal and island regions where mild climate promotes its spread. Australian/New Zealand Weed Risk Assessment gives it a "high risk, score of 15" rating and it is considered one of the world's 100 most invasive species.
Extensive ecological studies should be performed before further introduction of acacia varieties, as this fast-growing genus, once introduced, spreads quickly and is extremely difficult to eradicate.

Nineteen different species of "Acacia" in the Americas contain <a href="glycoside">cyanogenic glycosides</a>, which, if exposed to an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> which specifically splits glycosides, can release <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> (HCN) in the "leaves". This sometimes results in the poisoning death of <a href="livestock">livestock</a>.

If fresh plant material spontaneously produces 200 ppm or more HCN, then it is potentially toxic. This corresponds to about 7.5 μmol HCN per gram of fresh plant material. It turns out that, if acacia "leaves" lack the specific glycoside-splitting enzyme, then they may be less toxic than otherwise, even those containing significant quantities of cyanic glycosides.

Some "Acacia" species containing cyanogens include "<a href="Acacia%20erioloba">Acacia erioloba</a>", "A. cunninghamii", "A. obtusifolia", "A. sieberiana", and "A. sieberiana" var. "woodii"

The <a href="Arbre%20du%20T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Arbre du Ténéré</a> in <a href="Niger">Niger</a> was the most isolated tree in the world, about from any other tree. The tree was knocked down by a truck driver in 1973.

In <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, Kenya, the <a href="Stanley%20Hotel%2C%20Nairobi">Thorn Tree Café</a> is named after a Naivasha thorn tree ("Acacia xanthophloea") in its centre. Travelers used to pin notes to others to the thorns of the tree. The current tree is the third of the same variety.

Acapulco

Acapulco de Juárez (), commonly called Acapulco, is a city, <a href="municipalities%20of%20Mexico">municipality</a> and major seaport in the <a href="Political%20divisions%20of%20Mexico">state</a> of <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a> on the Pacific coast of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, south of <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. Acapulco is located on a deep, semicircular bay and has been a port since the early colonial period of Mexico's history. It is a port of call for shipping and cruise lines running between <a href="Panama">Panama</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a>, United States. The city of Acapulco is the largest in the state, far larger than the state capital <a href="Chilpancingo">Chilpancingo</a>. Acapulco is also Mexico's largest beach and <a href="balneario">balneario</a> resort city.

The city is one of Mexico's oldest beach resorts, which came into prominence in the 1940s throu 1960s as a getaway for Hollywood stars and millionaires. Acapulco is still famous and still attracts many tourists, although most are now from Mexico itself. The resort area is divided into three parts: The north end of the bay and beyond is the "traditional" area, which encompasses the area from Parque Papagao through the Zocalo and onto the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the main part of the bay known as "Zona Dorada" (golden zone in Spanish), where the famous in the mid-20th century vacationed, and the south end "Diamante" (diamond in Spanish) which is dominated by newer luxury high-rise hotels and condominiums.

The name "Acapulco" comes from <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> language "Aca-pōl-co", and means "where the reeds were destroyed or washed away". The "de Juárez" was added to the official name in 1885 to honor <a href="Benito%20Ju%C3%A1rez">Benito Juárez</a>, former <a href="President%20of%20Mexico">President of Mexico</a> (1806–1872). The seal for the city shows broken reeds or cane. The island and municipality of <a href="Capul">Capul</a>, in the Philippines, derives its name from Acapulco; Capul was the western end of the trans-Pacific sailing route from Acapulco to what was then a Spanish colony.

By the 8th century around the <a href="Acapulco%20Bay">Acapulco Bay</a> area, there was a small culture which would first be dominated by the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a>s, then by a number of others during the pre-Hispanic period and before it ended in the 1520s. At Acapulco Bay itself, there were two Olmec sites, one by <a href="Playa%20Larga">Playa Larga</a> and the other on a hill known as El Guitarrón. Olmec influence caused the small spread-out villages here to coalesce into larger entities and build ceremonial centers.

Later, <a href="Teotihuacan">Teotihuacan</a> influence made its way here via <a href="Cuernavaca">Cuernavaca</a> and Chilpancingo. Then <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a> influence arrived from the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and through what is now <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>. This history is known through the archaeological artifacts that have been found here, especially at Playa Hornos, Pie de la Cuesta and Tambuco.

In the 11th century, new waves of migration of <a href="Nahua%20peoples">Nahuas</a> and Coixas came through here. These people were the antecedents of the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s. In the later 15th century, after four years of military struggle, Acapulco became part of the <a href="Aztec%20empire">Aztec empire</a> during the reign of <a href="Ahuizotl">Ahuizotl</a> (1486–1502). It was annexed to a tributary province named "Tepecuacuilco". However, this was only transitory, as the Aztecs could only establish an unorganized military post at the city's outskirts. The city was on territory under control of the Yopes, who continued defending it and living there until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.

There are two stories about how Acapulco bay was discovered by Europeans. The first states that two years after the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire">Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire</a>, <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> sent explorers west to find gold. The explorers had subdued this area after 1523, and Captain Saavedra Cerón was authorized by Cortés to found a settlement here. The other states that the bay was discovered on December 13, 1526 by a small ship named the El Tepache Santiago captained by Santiago Guevara.
The first <a href="encomendero">encomendero</a> was established in 1525 at Cacahuatepec, which is part of the modern Acapulco municipality. In 1531, a number of Spaniards, most notably <a href="Juan%20Rodriguez%20de%20Villafuerte">Juan Rodriguez de Villafuerte</a>, left the Oaxaca coast and founded the village of Villafuerte where the city of Acapulco now stands. Villafuerte was unable to subdue the local native peoples, and this eventually resulted in the Yopa Rebellion in the region of Cuautepec. Hernán Cortés was obligated to send Vasco Porcayo to negotiate with the indigenous people giving concessions. The province of Acapulco became the encomendero of Rodriguez de Villafuerte who received taxes in the form of cocoa, cotton and corn.

Cortés established Acapulco as a major port by the early 1530s, with the first major road between Mexico City and the port constructed by 1531. The wharf, named Marqués, was constructed by 1533 between Bruja Point and Diamond Point. Soon after, the area was made an "alcadia" (major province or town).

Spanish trade in the Far East would give Acapulco a prominent position in the economy of <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>. Galleons started arriving here from Asia by 1550, and in that year thirty Spanish families were sent to live here from Mexico City to have a permanent base of European residents. Acapulco would become the second most important port, after <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, due to its direct trade with the Philippines. This trade would focus on the yearly <a href="Manila-Acapulco%20Galleon">Manila-Acapulco Galleon</a> trade, which was the nexus of all kinds of communications between New Spain, Europe and Asia. In 1573, the port was granted the monopoly of the Manila trade.

The <a href="Manila-Acapulco%20Galleon">galleon trade</a> made its yearly run from the mid-16th century until the early 19th. The luxury items it brought to New Spain attracted the attention of English and Dutch <a href="pirates">pirates</a>, such as <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>, <a href="Henry%20Morgan">Henry Morgan</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Cavendish">Thomas Cavendish</a>, who called it "The Black Ship." A Dutch fleet invaded Acapulco in 1615, destroying much of the town before being driven off. The <a href="Fort%20of%20San%20Diego">Fort of San Diego</a> was built the following year to protect the port and the cargo of arriving ships. The fort was destroyed by an earthquake in 1776 and was rebuilt between 1778 and 1783.
At the beginning of the 19th century, King Charles IV declared Acapulco a Ciudad Official and it became an essential part of the Spanish Crown. However, not long after, the <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a> began. In 1810, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Morelos%20y%20Pav%C3%B3n">José María Morelos y Pavón</a> attacked and burnt down the city, after he defeated royalist commander Francisco Parés at the Battle of Tres Palos. The independence of Mexico in 1821 ended the run of the Manila Galleon.
Acapulco's importance as a port recovered during the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> in the mid-19th-century, with ships going to and coming from Panama stopping here. This city was the besieged on 19 April 1854 by <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> after Guerrero's leadership had rebelled by issuing the <a href="Plan%20of%20Ayutla">Plan de Ayutla</a>. After an unsuccessful week of fighting, Santa Anna retreated.

In 1911, <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">revolutionary forces</a> took over the main plaza of Acapulco.
In 1920, the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> (the future <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VIII</a>) visited the area. Impressed by what he saw, he recommended the place to his compatriots in Europe, making it popular with the elite there. Much of the original hotel and trading infrastructure was built by an East Texas businessman named Albert B. Pullen from Corrigan, Texas, in the area now known as Old Acapulco. In 1933 Carlos Barnard started the first section of Hotel El Mirador, with 12 rooms on the cliffs of <a href="La%20Quebrada%2C%20Mexico">La Quebrada</a>. Wolf Schoenborn purchased large amounts of undeveloped land and Albert Pullen built the Las Americas Hotel.

In the mid-1940s, the first commercial wharf and warehouses were built. In the early 1950s, President <a href="Miguel%20Alem%C3%A1n%20Vald%C3%A9s">Miguel Alemán Valdés</a> upgraded the port's infrastructure, installing electrical lines, drainage systems, roads and the first highway to connect the port with Mexico City.
The economy grew and foreign investment increased with it. During the 1950s, Acapulco became the fashionable place for millionaire Hollywood stars such as <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Fisher%20%28singer%29">Eddie Fisher</a> and <a href="Brigitte%20Bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a>. Former Swing Musician <a href="Teddy%20Stauffer">Teddy Stauffer</a>, so called "Mister Acapulco", was a hotel manager ("Villa Vera", "Casablanca"), who attracted a lot of celebrities to Acapulco.

From a population of only 4,000 or 5,000 in the 1940s, by the early 1960s, Acapulco had a population of about 50,000. In 1958, the Diocese of Acapulco was created by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>. It became an archdiocese in 1983.

During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel here. However, as more hotels were built in the south part of the bay, the old hotels of the 1950s lost their grandeur.

In the 1970s, there was a significant expansion of the port.

The <a href="Miss%20Universe%201978">Miss Universe 1978</a> pageant took place in the city. In 1983, singer-songwriter <a href="Juan%20Gabriel">Juan Gabriel</a> wrote the song "Amor eterno", which pays homage to Acapulco. The song was first and most famously recorded by <a href="Rocio%20Durcal">Rocio Durcal</a>. Additionally, Acapulco is the hometown of actress, singer and comedian <a href="Aida%20Pierce">Aída Pierce</a>, who found fame during the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.

During the 1990s, the road known as the Ruta del Sol was built, crossing the mountains between Mexico City and Acapulco. The journey takes only about three and a half hours, making Acapulco a favorite weekend destination for Mexico City inhabitants. It was in that time period that the economic impact of Acapulco as a tourist destination increased positively and as a result a new type of services emerged like the <a href="Colegio%20Nautilus">Colegio Nautilus</a>. This educational project, backed by the state government, was created for the families of local and foreign investors and businessmen living in Acapulco who were in need of a bilingual and international education for their children.

The port continued to grow and in 1996, a new private company, API Acapulco, was created to manage operations. This consolidated operations and now Acapulco is the major port for car exports to the Pacific.
The city was devastated by <a href="Hurricane%20Pauline">Hurricane Pauline</a> in 1997. The storm stranded tourists and left more than 100 dead in the city. Most of the victims were from the <a href="shantytown">shantytown</a>s built on steep hillsides that surround the city. Other victims were swept away by thirty-foot waves and winds. The main road, Avenida Costera, became a fast-moving three-foot-deep river of sludge.

In the 2000s, the <a href="Mexican%20Drug%20War">drug war in Mexico</a> has had a negative effect on tourism in Acapulco as rival drug traffickers fight each other for the Guerrero coast route that brings drugs from South America as well as soldiers that have been fighting the cartels since 2006. A major gun battle between 18 gunmen and soldiers took place in the summer of 2009 in the Old Acapulco seaside area, lasting hours and killing 16 of the gunmen and two soldiers. This came after the swine flu outbreak earlier in the year nearly paralyzed the Mexican economy, forcing hotels to give discounts to bring tourists back. However, hotel occupancy for 2009 was down five percent from the year before. The death of Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009 resulted in infighting among different groups within the Beltran Leyva cartel.

Gang violence continued to plague Acapulco through 2010 and into 2011, most notably with at least 15 dying in drug-related violence on March 13, 2010, and another 15 deaths on January 8, 2011. Among the first incident's dead were six members of the city police and the brother of an ex-mayor. In the second incident, the headless bodies of 15 young men were found dumped near the Plaza Senderos shopping center. On August 20, 2011, Mexican authorities reported that five headless bodies were found in Acapulco, three of which were placed in the city's main tourist area and two of which were cut into multiple pieces. On February 4, 2013, six Spanish men were tied up and robbed and the six Spanish women with them were gang-raped by five masked gunmen who stormed a beach house on the outskirts of Acapulco, though after these accusations, none of the victims decided to press charges. On September 28, 2014, a Mexican politician called <a href="Braulio%20Zaragoza">Braulio Zaragoza</a> was gunned down at the El Mirador hotel in the city. He was the leader of the conservative opposition <a href="National%20Action%20Party%20%28Mexico%29">National Action Party</a> (PAN) in southern Guerrero state. Several politicians have been targeted by <a href="drug%20cartels">drug cartels</a> operating in the area. Investigations are under way, but no arrests have yet been made. The insecurity due to individuals involved with drug cartels has cost the city of Acapulco its popularity among national and international tourists. It was stated by the Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil that the amount of international flyers coming to Acapulco decreased from 355,760 flyers registered in 2006 to 52,684 flyers in the year 2015, the amount of international tourists flying to Acapulco lost 85% in the interval of nine years.

The city, located on the Pacific coast of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> in the state of <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a>, is classified as one of the state's seven regions, dividing the rest of the Guerrero coast into the <a href="Costa%20Grande%20of%20Guerrero">Costa Grande</a> and the <a href="Costa%20Chica%20of%20Guerrero">Costa Chica</a>.
Forty percent of the municipality is mountainous terrain. Another forty percent is semi-flat, and the other twenty percent is flat. Altitude varies from sea level to . The highest peaks are Potrero, San Nicolas and Alto Camarón. There is one major river, the Papagayo, which runs through the municipality, along with a number of arroyos. There are also two small lagoons, Tres Palos and Coyuca. along with a number of thermal springs.
Acapulco features a <a href="tropical%20wet%20and%20dry%20climate">tropical wet and dry climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen-Geiger%20climate%20classification%20system">Köppen</a>: Aw): hot with distinct wet and dry seasons, with more even temperatures between seasons than resorts farther north in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, but this varies depending on altitude. The warmest areas are next to the sea where the city is. Tropical storms and hurricanes are threats from May through November. The forested area tends to lose leaves during the winter dry season, with evergreen pines in the highest elevations. Fauna consists mostly of deer, small mammals, a wide variety of both land and sea birds, and marine animals such as turtles.

The temperature of the sea is quite stable, with lows of between January – March, and a high of in August.

As the seat of a municipality, the city of Acapulco is the government authority for over 700 other communities, which together have a territory of 1,880.60 km. This municipality borders the municipalities of Chilpancingo, <a href="Juan%20R.%20Escudero%20%28municipality%29">Juan R Escudero (Tierra Colorada)</a>, <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20Guerrero">San Marcos</a>, <a href="Coyuca%20de%20Ben%C3%ADtez">Coyuca de Benítez</a> with the Pacific Ocean to the south.

The metropolitan area is made up of the municipalities of Acapulco de Juárez and Coyuca de Benitez. The area has a population () of 786,830.

Tourism is the main economic activity of the municipality and most of this is centered on Acapulco Bay. About seventy-three percent of the municipality's population is involved in commerce, most of it related to tourism and the port. Mining and manufacturing employ less than twenty percent and only about five percent is dedicated to agriculture. Industrial production is limited mostly to bottling, milk products, cement products, and ice and energy production. Agricultural products include tomatoes, corn, watermelon, beans, green chili peppers, and melons.

Acapulco is one of Mexico's oldest coastal tourist destinations, reaching prominence in the 1950s as the place where Hollywood stars and millionaires vacationed on the beach in an exotic locale. In modern times, tourists in Acapulco have been facing problems with local corrupt police who steal money by extortion and intimidate visitors with threats of jail.

The "original" Acapulco, where hotels like Hotel Los Flamingos, owned by personalities <a href="Johnny%20Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a> and <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> are located, is on the northern end of the bay. This area is part of the "traditional zone", anchored by attractions such as the beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, the cliff divers of La Quebrada, and the city square, known as "El Zocalo." The "heyday" of this part of Acapulco ran from the late 30s until the 60s. Starting in the late 50s, and with development continuing through the 80s, the main area of Acapulco bay grew into what as known at the "Zona Dorada" or Golden Zone. This is where the boardwalk and main square are and today the area is filled with modern, Mexican and International branded hotels, with discothèques and restaurants within walking distance. This area also has the higher hotel occupancy rates.

South of the bay connected by the highway La Escenia holds the newer constructions, including high-rise hotels and condominios. This area known simply as "Acapulco Diamante" includes Playa Diamante, Puerto Marqués, and stretches from the airport to the mountains that separates it from the bay. In this area, all along Boulevard de Las Naciones no one walks, as almost all transportation is by car, limousine or golf cart. The older section of town now caters to mostly middle class, almost exclusively Mexican clientele, while the glitzier newer section caters to the Mexican upper classes, many of whom never venture into the older, traditional part of town.

Acapulco's reputation is that of a high-energy party town, where one can "have dinner at midnight, dance until dawn then relax in the daytime on the beach. The nightlife has long been a major tourist draw of the city. From November to April, luxury liners stop here daily and include ships such as the <a href="MS%20Queen%20Victoria">MS "Queen Victoria"</a>, the <a href="MS%20Rotterdam">MS "Rotterdam"</a>, "<a href="Crystal%20Harmony">Crystal Harmony</a>", and all the Princess line ships. Despite Acapulco's international fame, most of its visitors are from central Mexico, especially the affluent from Mexico City. Acapulco is one of the embarkation ports for the Mexican cruise line <a href="Ocean%20Star%20Cruises">Ocean Star Cruises</a>.

For the Christmas season of 2009, Acapulco received 470,000 visitors, most of whom are Mexican nationals, adding 785 million pesos to the economy. Eighty percent arrive by land and 18 percent by air. The area has over 25,000 condominiums, most of which function as second homes for their Mexican owners. Acapulco is still popular with Mexican celebrities and the wealthy, such as <a href="Luis%20Miguel">Luis Miguel</a>, <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>, and <a href="Dolores%20Olmedo">Dolores Olmedo</a>, who maintain homes here.
While much of the glitz and glamour that made Acapulco famous still remains, from the latter 20th century on, the city has also taken on other less-positive reputations. Some consider it a "passé" resort, eclipsed by the newer <a href="Canc%C3%BAn">Cancún</a> and <a href="Cabo%20San%20Lucas">Cabo San Lucas</a>. Over the years, a number of problems have developed here, especially in the bay and the older sections of the city. The large number of wandering vendors on the beaches such as Tamarindos, who offer everything from newspapers to massages, are a recognized problem. It is a bother to tourists who simply want to relax on the beach, but the government says it is difficult to eradicate, as there is a lot of unemployment and poverty here. Around the city are many small shantytowns that cling to the mountainsides, populated by migrants who have come here looking for work. In the last decade, drug-related violence has caused problems for the local tourism trade.

Another problem is garbage that has accumulated in the bay. Although 60.65 tons have recently been extracted from the bays of Acapulco and nearby Zihuatanejo, more needs to be done. Most of trash removal during the off seasons is done on the beaches and in the waters closest to them. However, the center of the bay is not touched. The reason trash winds up in the bay is that it is common here to throw it in streets, rivers and the bay itself. The most common items cleaned out of the bay are beer bottles and car tires. Acapulco has seen some success in this area, having several beaches receiving the high "blue flag" certifications for cleanliness and water quality

Acapulco's gastronomy is very rich, the following are typical dishes from the region:
Relleno is baked pork with a variety of vegetables and fruits such as potatoes, raisins, carrots and chiles. It is eaten with bread called bolillo.
Pozole is a soup with a salsa base (it can be white, red or green),corn, meat that can be either pork or chicken and it is accompanied with 'antojitos' like tostadas, tacos and tamales. This dish is served as part of a weekly Thursday event in the city and the state, with many restaurants offering the meal with special entertainment, from bands to dancers to celebrity impersonators.

Acapulco's main attraction is its nightlife, as it has been for many decades. Nightclubs change names and owners frequently. 
For example, Baby ‘O has been open to the national and international public since 1976 and different celebrities have visited their installations such as Mexican singer Luis Miguel, Bono from U2 and Sylvester Stallone. Another nightclub is Palladium, located in the Escénica Avenue, the location gives the nightclub a beautiful view of the Santa Lucia Bay at night. Various dj’s have had a performance in Palladium among them DVBBS, Tom Swoon, NERVO and Junkie KID.

Informal lobby or poolside cocktail bars often offer free live entertainment. In addition, there is the beach bar zone, where younger crowds go. These are located along the Costera road, face the ocean and feature techno or alternative rock. Most are concentrated between the Fiesta Americana and Continental Plaza hotels. These places tend to open earlier and have more informal dress. There is a <a href="bungee%20jump">bungee jump</a> in this area as well.
Another enigmatic attraction at Acapulco are the <a href="La%20Quebrada%20Cliff%20Divers">La Quebrada Cliff Divers</a>. The tradition started in the 1930s when young men casually competed against each other to see who could dive from the highest point into the sea below. Eventually, locals began to ask for tips for those coming to see the men dive. Today the divers are professionals, diving from heights of into <a href="La%20Quebrada%2C%20Mexico">an inlet that is only wide and deep</a>, after praying first at a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. On December 12, the feast day of this Virgin, freestyle cliff divers jump into the sea to honor her. Dives range from the simple to the complicated and end with the "Ocean of Fire" when the sea is lit with gasoline, making a circle of flames which the diver aims for. The spectacle can be seen from a public area which charges a small fee or from the Hotel Plaza Las Glorias/El Mirador from its bar or restaurant terrace.

There are a number of beaches in the Acapulco Bay and the immediate coastline. In the bay proper there are the La Angosta (in the Quebrada), Caleta, Caletilla, Dominguillo, Tlacopanocha, Hornos, Hornitos, Honda, Tamarindo, Condesa, Guitarrón, Icacos, Playuela, Playuelilla and Playa del Secreto. In the adjoining, smaller Bay of Puerto Marqués there is Pichilingue, Las Brisas, and Playa Roqueta. Facing open ocean just northwest of the bays is Pie de la Cuesta and southeast are Playa Revolcadero, Playa Aeromar, Playa Encantada and Barra Vieja. Two lagoons are in the area, Coyuca to the northwest of Acapulco Bay and Tres Palos to the southeast. Both lagoons have mangroves and offer boat tours. Tres Palos also has sea turtle nesting areas which are protected.

In addition to sunbathing, the beaches around the bay offer a number of services, such as boat rentals, boat tours, horseback riding, scuba diving and other aquatic sports. One popular cruise is from Caletilla Beach to Roqueta Island, which has places to snorkel, have lunch, and a lighthouse. There is also an underwater statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe here, created in 1958 by Armando Quesado in memory of a group of divers who died here. Many of the scuba-diving tours come to this area as well, where there are sunken ships, sea mountains, and cave rock formations. Another popular activity is deep-sea fishing. The major attraction is sail fishing. Fish caught here have weighed between 89 and 200 pounds. <a href="Sailfish">Sailfish</a> are so plentiful that boat captains have been known to bet with a potential customer that if he does not catch anything, the trip is free.

In the old part of the city, there is a traditional main square called the Zócalo, lined with shade trees, cafés and shops. At the north end of the square is Nuestra Señora de la Soledad cathedral, with blue onion-shaped domes and Byzantine towers. The building was originally constructed as a movie set, but was later adapted into a church. Acapulco's most historic building is the <a href="Fort%20of%20San%20Diego">Fort of San Diego</a>, located east of the main square and originally built in 1616 to protect the city from <a href="pirate">pirate</a> attacks. The fort was partially destroyed by the Dutch in the mid-17th century, rebuilt, then destroyed again in 1776 by an earthquake. It was rebuilt again by 1783 and this is the building that can be seen today, unchanged except for renovations done to it in 2000. Parts of the moats remain as well as the five bulwarks and the battlements. Today the fort serves as the Museo Histórico de Acapulco (Acapulco Historical Museum), which shows the port's history from the pre-Hispanic period until independence. There are temporary exhibits as well.
The Centro Internacional de Convivencia Infantil or CICI is a sea-life and aquatic park located on Costera Miguel Aleman. It offers wave pools, water slides and water toboggans. There are also dolphin shows daily and a swim with dolphins program. The center mostly caters to children. Another place that is popular with children is the Parque Papagayo: a large family park which has life-sized replicas of a Spanish galleon and the space shuttle Columbia, three artificial lakes, an aviary, a skating rink, rides, go-karts and more.

The Dolores Olmedo House is located in the traditional downtown of Acapulco and is noted for the murals by <a href="Diego%20Rivera">Diego Rivera</a> that adorn it. Olmedo and Rivera had been friend since Olmedo was a child and Rivera spent the last two years of his life here. During that time, he painted nearly nonstop and created the outside walls with tile mosaics, featuring Aztec deities such as <a href="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a>. The interior of the home is covered in murals. The home is not a museum, so only the outside murals are able to be seen by the public.

There is a small museum called Casa de la Máscara (House of Masks) which is dedicated to masks, most of them from Mexico, but there are examples from many parts of the world. The collection contains about one thousand examples and is divided into seven rooms called Masks of the World, Mexico across History, The <a href="Huichol%20people">Huichol</a>s and the Jaguar, Alebrijes and Dances of Guerrero, Devils and Death, Identity and Fantasy, and Afro-Indian masks.
The Botanical Garden of Acapulco is a tropical garden located on lands owned by the Universidad Loyola del Pacífico. Most of the plants here are native to the region, and many, such as the <a href="Peltogyne%20mexicana">Peltogyne mexicana</a> or purple stick tree, are in danger of extinction.

One cultural event that is held yearly in Acapulco is the Festival Internacional de la Nao, it takes place in the Fort of San Diego, located near the Zócalo in downtown of the city. The Festival honors the remembrance of the city’s interaction and trades with Oriental territories which started back in the Sixteenth Century. The Nao Festival consists of cultural activities with the support of organizations and embassies from India, China, Japan, Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea. The variety of events go from film projections, musical interpretations and theatre to gastronomical classes, some of the events are specifically for kids.

The annual French Festival takes place throughout Acapulco city and offers a multitude of events that cement cultural links between Mexico and France. The main features are a fashion show and a gourmet food fair. The Cinépolis Galerías Diana and the Teatro Juan Ruíz de Alarcón present French and French literary figures who give talks on their specialised subjects. Even some of the local nightclubs feature French DJs. Other festivals celebrated here include <a href="Carnival">Carnival</a>, the feast of San Isidro Labrador on 15 May, and in November, a crafts and livestock fair called the Nao de China.

There are a number of golf courses in Acapulco including the Acapulco Princess and the Pierre Marqués course, the latter designed by <a href="Robert%20Trent%20Jones">Robert Trent Jones</a> in 1972 for the <a href="World%20Cup%20%28men%27s%20golf%29">World Cup Golf Tournament</a>. The Mayan Palace course was designed by <a href="Pedro%20Guericia">Pedro Guericia</a> and an economical course called the Club de Golf Acapulco is near the convention center. The most exclusive course is that of the Tres Vidas Golf Club, designed by <a href="Robert%20von%20Hagge">Robert von Hagge</a>. It is located next to the ocean and is home to flocks of ducks and other birds.

Another famous sport tournament that has been held in Acapulco since 1993 is the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, a 500 ATP that takes place in the tennis courts of the Princess Mundo Imperial, a resort located in the Diamante zone of Acapulco. Initially it was played in clay courts but it changed to hard court. The event has gained popularity within the passing of the years, in 2017 the tournament took place from the 27th of February to the 4th of March. The athletes who participated in the competition were some of the most famous players in the last couple of years, among them were Novak Djokovic currently ranked second, Rafael Nadal positioned sixth in the ranking and Marin Cilic who is the number eight in the ranking.
The prizes are $250,000.00 USD for WTA and $1,200,000.00 USD for ATP.

Acapulco also has a <a href="bullring">bullring</a>, called the Plaza de Toros, near Caletilla Beach. The season runs during the winter and is called the Fiesta Brava.

Over 100,000 American teenagers and young adults travel to resort areas and <a href="balneario">balneario</a>s throughout <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> during spring break each year. The main reason students head to Mexico is the 18-year-old drinking age (versus 21 for the United States), something that has been marketed by tour operators along with the sun and ocean. This has become attractive since the 1990s, especially since more traditional spring break places such as <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona Beach, Florida</a>, have enacted restrictions on drinking and other behaviors. This legislation has pushed spring break visitation to various parts of Mexico, with Acapulco as one of the top destinations.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, <a href="Canc%C3%BAn">Cancún</a> had been favored as the spring break destination of choice. However, Cancún has taken some steps to control the reckless behavior associated with the event, and students have been looking for someplace new. This has led many more to choose Acapulco, in spite of the fact that for many travelers, the flight is longer and more expensive than to Cancún. Many are attracted by the glitzy hotels on the south side and Acapulco's famous nightlife. In 2008, 22,500 students came to Acapulco for spring break. Hotels did not get that many in 2009, due mostly to the economic situation in the United States, and partially because of scares of drug-related violence.

In February 2009, the US State Department issued a travel alert directed at college students planning spring break trips to Acapulco. The warning—a result of violent activity springing from Mexico's drug cartel débâcle—took college campuses by storm, with some schools going so far as to warn their students about the risks of travel to Mexico over spring break. The New York Times tracked the travels of a Penn student on spring break in Acapulco just a week after the dissemination of the email, while <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28political%20commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> devoted a segment of his show, "<a href="The%20O%27Reilly%20Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>", to urge students to stay away from Acapulco. In June 2009, a number of incidents occurred between the drug cartel and the government. These included coordinated attacks on police headquarters and open battles in the streets, involving large-caliber weapons and grenades. However, no incidents of violence against spring breakers were reported.

From the U.S., many airlines now fly to <a href="General%20Juan%20N.%20%C3%81lvarez%20International%20Airport">Juan N. Álvarez International Airport</a> year-round. In the city, there are many buses and taxi services one can take to get from place to place, but most of the locals choose to walk to their destinations. However, an important mode of transportation is the government subsidized 'Colectivo' cab system. These cabs cost 13 <a href="Mexican%20peso">pesos</a> per person to ride, but they are not private. The driver will pick up more passengers as long as seats are available, and will transport them to their destination based on first-come first-served rules. The colectivos each travel a designated area of the city, the three main ones being Costera, Colosio, Coloso, or a mixture of the three. Coloso cabs travel mainly to old Acapulco. Colosio cabs travel through most of the tourist area of Acapulco. Costera cabs drive up and down the coast of Acapulco, where most of the hotels for visitors are located, but which includes some of old Acapulco. Where a driver will take you is partly his choice. Some are willing to travel to the other designated areas, especially during slow periods of the day.

The bus system is highly complex and can be rather confusing to an outsider. As far as transportation goes, it is the cheapest form, other than walking, in Acapulco. The most expensive buses have air conditioning, while the cheaper buses do not. For tourists, the Acapulco city government has established a system of yellow buses with Acapulco painted on the side of them. These buses are not for tourists only, but are certainly the nicest and most uniform of the bus systems. These buses travel the tourist section of Acapulco, driving up and down the coast. There are buses with specific routes and destinations, generally written on their windshields or shouted out by a barker riding in the front seat. Perhaps the most unusual thing about the privately operated buses is the fact that they are all highly decorated and personalized, with decals and home-made interior designs that range from comic book scenes, to pornography, and even to "<a href="Hello%20Kitty">Hello Kitty</a>" themes.

The conflictive public transportation would be upgraded the 25th of June 2016 with the implementation of the Acabus. The Acabus infrastructure has a length of , counts with 16 stations that spread through the city of Acapulco and 5 routes. This project will help organize traffic because the buses now have a specific line on the roads and there would be more control over transportation and passengers.

Alan Curtis Kay (born May 17, 1940) is an American <a href="computer%20scientist">computer scientist</a>. He has been elected a Fellow of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Engineering">National Academy of Engineering</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a>. He is best known for his pioneering work on <a href="object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented programming</a> and <a href="Window%20%28computing%29">windowing</a> <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> design.

He is the president of the <a href="Viewpoints%20Research%20Institute">Viewpoints Research Institute</a>, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>. He is also on the advisory board of <a href="TTI/Vanguard">TTI/Vanguard</a>. Until mid-2005, he was a Senior Fellow at <a href="HP%20Labs">HP Labs</a>, a Visiting Professor at <a href="Kyoto%20University">Kyoto University</a>, and an Adjunct Professor at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT). After 10 years at Xerox PARC, Kay became <a href="Atari">Atari</a>'s chief scientist for three years.

Kay is also a former professional <a href="jazz%20guitarist">jazz guitarist</a>, composer, and theatrical designer, and an amateur classical <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a>ist.

In an interview on education in America with the Davis Group Ltd. Alan Kay said,

Originally from <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>, Kay attended the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, earning a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> in Mathematics and Molecular Biology. Before and during this time, he worked as a professional <a href="jazz">jazz</a> guitarist.

In 1966, he began graduate school at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah%20College%20of%20Engineering">University of Utah College of Engineering</a>, earning a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a> and a <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> degree.

His doctoral thesis was entitled "FLEX: A Flexible Extendable Language", describing an invention of <a href="computer%20language">computer language</a> known as <a href="Flex%20%28language%29">FLEX</a>.

While at the University of Utah, he worked with <a href="Ivan%20Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland</a>, who had done pioneering graphics programs including <a href="Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>. This greatly inspired Kay's evolving views on objects and programming. As he grew busier with <a href="Defense%20Advanced%20Research%20Projects%20Agency">ARPA</a> research, he quit his career as a professional musician.

In 1968, he met <a href="Seymour%20Papert">Seymour Papert</a> and learned of the <a href="Logo%20%28programming%20language%29">Logo</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>, a <a href="Programming%20language%20dialect">dialect</a> of <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a> optimized for <a href="education">education</a>al purposes. This led him to learn of the work of <a href="Jean%20Piaget">Jean Piaget</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Bruner">Jerome Bruner</a>, <a href="Lev%20Vygotsky">Lev Vygotsky</a>, and of <a href="Constructionism%20%28learning%20theory%29">constructionist learning</a>. These further influenced his views.

In 1970, Kay joined <a href="Xerox">Xerox</a> Corporation's <a href="Palo%20Alto%2C%20California">Palo Alto</a> Research Center, <a href="PARC%20%28company%29">PARC</a>. In the 1970s he was one of the key members there to develop prototypes of networked workstations using the programming language <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>. These inventions were later commercialized by <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> in their <a href="Apple%20Lisa">Lisa</a> and <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers.

Kay is one of the fathers of the idea of <a href="object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented programming</a>, which he named, along with some colleagues at PARC. Some of the original object-oriented concepts, including the use of the words 'object' and 'class', had been developed for Simula 67 at the <a href="Norwegian%20Computing%20Center">Norwegian Computing Center</a>. Later he said: 

I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the

Kay conceived the <a href="Dynabook">Dynabook</a> concept which defined the conceptual basics for <a href="laptop">laptop</a> and <a href="tablet%20computer">tablet</a> computers and <a href="E-book">E-book</a>s, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI). Because the Dynabook was conceived as an educational platform, Kay is considered to be one of the first researchers into <a href="mobile%20learning">mobile learning</a>, and indeed, many features of the Dynabook concept have been adopted in the design of the <a href="One%20Laptop%20Per%20Child">One Laptop Per Child</a> educational platform, with which Kay is actively involved.

The field of computing is awaiting new revolution to happen, according to Kay, in which educational communities, parents, and children will not see in it a set of tools invented by <a href="Douglas%20Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a>, but a medium in the <a href="Marshall%20McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> sense. He wrote:

As with Simulas leading to OOP, this encounter finally hit me with what the destiny of personal computing really was going to be. Not a personal dynamic vehicle, as in Engelbart’s metaphor opposed to the IBM “railroads”, but something much more profound: a personal dynamic medium. With a vehicle one could wait until high school and give “drivers ed”, but if it was a medium, it had to extend into the world of childhood.

Starting in 1984, Kay was an Apple Fellow at <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> until the closing of the ATG (<a href="Apple%20Advanced%20Technology%20Group">Advanced Technology Group</a>), one of the company's R&D divisions. He was then recruited by his friend <a href="Bran%20Ferren">Bran Ferren</a>, head of R&D at Walt Disney, to join <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering">Walt Disney Imagineering</a> as a <a href="Disney%20Fellow">Disney Fellow</a> and remained there until Ferren left to start Applied Minds Inc, with Imagineer <a href="Danny%20Hillis">Danny Hillis</a>, and Disney ended its Fellows program. After Disney, in 2001 he founded <a href="Viewpoints%20Research%20Institute">Viewpoints Research Institute</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to children, learning, and advanced software development. For its first ten years, Kay and his Viewpoints group were based at Applied Minds in Glendale, where he and Ferren continued to work together on various projects.

Later, Kay became a Senior Fellow at <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> until HP disbanded the Advanced Software Research Team on July 20, 2005. He is currently head of <a href="Viewpoints%20Research%20Institute">Viewpoints Research Institute</a>.

Kay taught a Fall 2011 class, "Powerful Ideas: Useful Tools to Understand the World", at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) along with full-time ITP faculty member Nancy Hechinger. The goal of the class was to devise new forms of teaching/learning based on fundamental, powerful concepts rather than traditional rote learning.

In December 1995, while still at Apple, Kay collaborated with many others to start the <a href="open%20source">open source</a> <a href="Squeak">Squeak</a> version of <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, and he continues to work on it. As part of this effort, in November 1996, his team began research on what became the <a href="Etoys%20%28programming%20language%29">Etoys</a> system. More recently he started, along with <a href="David%20A.%20Smith%20%28computer%20scientist%29">David A. Smith</a>, <a href="David%20P.%20Reed">David P. Reed</a>, <a href="Andreas%20Raab">Andreas Raab</a>, Rick McGeer, <a href="Julian%20Lombardi">Julian Lombardi</a> and <a href="Mark%20McCahill">Mark McCahill</a>, the <a href="Croquet%20Project">Croquet Project</a>, an open source networked 2D and 3D environment for collaborative work.

In 2001, it became clear that the Etoy architecture in Squeak had reached its limits in what the Morphic interface infrastructure could do. <a href="Andreas%20Raab">Andreas Raab</a> was a researcher working in Kay's group, then at Hewlett-Packard. He proposed defining a "script process" and providing a default scheduling mechanism that avoids several more general problems. The result was a new user interface, proposed to replace the Squeak Morphic user interface in the future. <a href="Tweak%20programming%20environment">Tweak</a> added mechanisms of islands, asynchronous messaging, players and costumes, language extensions, projects, and tile scripting. Its underlying object system is <a href="Class%20%28computer%20programming%29">class-based</a>, but to users (during programming) it acts like it is <a href="Prototype-based%20programming">prototype-based</a>. Tweak objects are created and run in Tweak project windows.

In November 2005, at the <a href="World%20Summit%20on%20the%20Information%20Society">World Summit on the Information Society</a>, the MIT research laboratories unveiled a new laptop computer, for educational use around the world. It has many names: the $100 Laptop, the <a href="One%20Laptop%20per%20Child">One Laptop per Child</a> program, the Children's Machine, and the <a href="XO-1%20%28laptop%29">XO-1</a>. The program was begun and is sustained by Kay's friend, <a href="Nicholas%20Negroponte">Nicholas Negroponte</a>, and is based on Kay's <a href="Dynabook">Dynabook</a> ideal. Kay is a prominent co-developer of the computer, focusing on its educational software using Squeak and Etoys.

Kay has lectured extensively on the idea that the computer revolution is very new, and all of the good ideas have not been universally implemented. Lectures at OOPSLA 1997 conference and his ACM Turing award talk, entitled "The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" were informed by his experiences with <a href="Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>, <a href="Simula">Simula</a>, <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, and the bloated code of commercial software.

On August 31, 2006, Kay's proposal to the United States <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (NSF) was granted, thus funding <a href="Viewpoints%20Research%20Institute">Viewpoints Research Institute</a> for several years. The proposal title was: "STEPS Toward the Reinvention of Programming": A compact and Practical Model of Personal Computing as a Self-exploratorium. A sense of what Kay is trying to do comes from this quote, from the abstract of a seminar on this given at Intel Research Labs, Berkeley: "The conglomeration of commercial and most open source software consumes in the neighborhood of several hundreds of millions of lines of code these days. We wonder: how small could be an understandable practical "Model T" design that covers this functionality? 1M lines of code? 200K LOC? 100K LOC? 20K LOC?"

Alan Kay has received many awards and honors. Among them:

His other honors include the J-D Warnier Prix d’Informatique, the ACM Systems Software Award, the NEC Computers & Communication Foundation Prize, the Funai Foundation Prize, the Lewis Branscomb Technology Award, and the ACM SIGCSE Award for Outstanding Contributions to Computer Science Education.
