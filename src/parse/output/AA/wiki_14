Andrew Carnegie

Andrew Carnegie ( , but commonly or ; November 25, 1835August 11, 1919) was a <a href="Scottish-American">Scottish-American</a> <a href="industrialist">industrialist</a>.

Carnegie led the expansion of the American <a href="steel%20industry">steel industry</a> in the late 19th century and is often identified as <a href="List%20of%20wealthiest%20historical%20figures">one of the richest people</a> (and <a href="List%20of%20richest%20Americans%20in%20history">richest Americans)</a> ever. He became a leading <a href="philanthropist">philanthropist</a> in the United States, and in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. During the last 18 years of his life, he gave away about $350 million to charities, foundations, and universitiesalmost 90 percent of his fortune. His 1889 article proclaiming "<a href="The%20Gospel%20of%20Wealth">The Gospel of Wealth</a>" called on the rich to use their wealth to improve society, and stimulated a wave of philanthropy.

Carnegie was born in <a href="Dunfermline">Dunfermline</a>, Scotland, and emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1848. Carnegie started work as a <a href="telegrapher">telegrapher</a>, and by the 1860s had investments in railroads, railroad sleeping cars, bridges, and oil derricks. He accumulated further wealth as a bond salesman, raising money for American enterprise in Europe. He built Pittsburgh's <a href="Carnegie%20Steel%20Company">Carnegie Steel Company</a>, which he sold to <a href="J.P.%20Morgan">J.P. Morgan</a> in 1901 for $480 million. It became the <a href="U.S.%20Steel%20Corporation">U.S. Steel Corporation</a>. After selling Carnegie Steel, he surpassed <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a> as the richest American for the next couple of years.

Carnegie devoted the remainder of his life to large-scale philanthropy, with special emphasis on <a href="Carnegie%20library">local libraries</a>, world peace, education, and scientific research. With the fortune he made from business, he built <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> and the <a href="Peace%20Palace">Peace Palace</a> and founded the <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>, <a href="Carnegie%20Endowment%20for%20International%20Peace">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a>, <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20for%20Science">Carnegie Institution for Science</a>, <a href="Carnegie%20Trust%20for%20the%20Universities%20of%20Scotland">Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland</a>, <a href="Carnegie%20Hero%20Fund">Carnegie Hero Fund</a>, <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> and the <a href="Carnegie%20Museums%20of%20Pittsburgh">Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh</a>, among others.

Andrew Carnegie was born in Dunfermline, Scotland in 1835, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room, consisting of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family. The main room served as a living room, dining room and bedroom. He was named after his legal grandfather. In 1836, the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy <a href="damask">damask</a> from which his father, William Carnegie, benefited. He was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline, which had been a gift to the town by the philanthropist <a href="Adam%20Rolland">Adam Rolland</a> of Gask.

His uncle, George Lauder Sr., a Scottish political leader, deeply influenced him as a boy by introducing him to the writings of <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> and historical Scottish heroes such as <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a>, <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Roy%20MacGregor">Rob Roy</a>. Lauder's son, also named <a href="George%20Lauder%20%28Scottish%20industrialist%29">George Lauder</a>, grew up with Andrew and would become his business partner. When Carnegie was thirteen, his father had fallen on very hard times as a handloom weaver; making matters worse, the country was in starvation. His mother helped support the family by assisting her brother (a cobbler), and by selling potted meats at her "sweetie shop". By the 1840s, she was the primary breadwinner. Struggling to make ends meet, the Carnegies then decided to move with his family to <a href="Allegheny%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny, Pennsylvania</a>, in the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life.

Andrew's family had to borrow money from the Lauders in order to migrate. Allegheny was a growing industrial area that produced many products including wool and cotton cloth. The "Made in Allegheny" label used on these and other diversified products was becoming more and more popular. His first job at age 13 in 1848 was as a <a href="bobbin%20boy">bobbin boy</a>, changing spools of thread in a cotton mill 12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a Pittsburgh cotton factory. His starting wage was $1.20 per week ($36.36 in 2017 dollars).

In 1849, Carnegie became a telegraph messenger boy in the Pittsburgh Office of the Ohio Telegraph Company, at $2.50 per week (or $76 in 2017 dollars), following the recommendation of his uncle. He was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced. He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip, and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night. Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a "self-made man" in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he "resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man". His capacity, his willingness for hard work, his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities.

Starting in 1853, <a href="Tom%20Scott%20%28PRR%29">Thomas A. Scott</a> of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad%20Company">Pennsylvania Railroad Company</a> employed Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week ($125.00 in 2017 dollars). Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company. At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country. As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year ($47,000 in 2017). His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.

Scott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, <a href="John%20Edgar%20Thomson">John Edgar Thomson</a>, which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties "as part of a <a href="quid%20pro%20quo">quid pro quo</a>". In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the <a href="Adams%20Express%20Company">Adams Express</a>, which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott. A few years later, he received a few shares in <a href="Theodore%20Tuttle%20Woodruff">Theodore Tuttle Woodruff</a>'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and <a href="Track%20%28rail%20transport%29">rails</a>), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.

Before the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of <a href="George%20Pullman">George Pullman</a>, the inventor of a <a href="sleeping%20car">sleeping car</a> for <a href="first%20class%20travel">first class travel</a> which facilitated business travel at distances over . The investment proved a great success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.

In spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Bull Run</a>, he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was "the first casualty of the war" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.

Defeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of <a href="munition">munition</a>s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.

In 1864, Carnegie invested $40,000 in Story Farm on Oil Creek in <a href="Venango%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Venango County, Pennsylvania</a>. In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel <a href="rolling%20mill">rolling mill</a>, and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.

After the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his <a href="Keystone%20Bridge%20Company">Keystone Bridge Company</a> and the rails produced by his <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a>. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions—functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage.
Carnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote: 

Carnegie did not want to marry during his mother's lifetime, instead choosing to take care of her in her illness towards the end of her life. After she died in 1886, the 51-year-old Carnegie married <a href="Louise%20Whitfield%20Carnegie">Louise Whitfield</a>, who was 21 years his junior. In 1897, the couple had their only child, a daughter, whom they named after Carnegie's mother, Margaret.

Carnegie made his fortune in the <a href="steel%20industry">steel industry</a>, controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> for <a href="steel%20making">steel making</a>. <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Bessemer">Sir Henry Bessemer</a> had invented the furnace which allowed the high carbon content of <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way. The steel price dropped as a direct result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.

The second was in his <a href="vertical%20integration">vertical integration</a> of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a>, steel rails, and <a href="coke%20%28fuel%29">coke</a> in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of <a href="pig%20iron">pig metal</a> per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival <a href="Homestead%20Steel%20Works">Homestead Steel Works</a>, which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a long railway, and a line of <a href="Great%20Lakes%20freighter">lake steamships</a>. Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the <a href="Carnegie%20Steel%20Company">Carnegie Steel Company</a>.

By 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the <a href="Edgar%20Thomson%20Steel%20Works">J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works</a> in <a href="Braddock%2C%20Pennsylvania">Braddock</a>, (named for <a href="John%20Edgar%20Thomson">John Edgar Thomson</a>, Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark <a href="Eads%20Bridge">Eads Bridge</a> project across the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> at <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.

In 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation to this end. <a href="John%20Pierpont%20Morgan">John Pierpont Morgan</a> was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the <a href="United%20States%20Steel%20Corporation">United States Steel Corporation</a>. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.

The buyout, secretly negotiated by <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schwab">Charles M. Schwab</a> (no relation to <a href="Charles%20R.%20Schwab">Charles R. Schwab</a>), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business. His steel enterprises were bought out at a figure equivalent to 12 times their annual earnings—$480 million (in , $).

Carnegie's share of this amounted to $225,639,000 (in , $), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1,400,000,000—4% of U.S. national wealth at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230,000,000 worth of bonds. It was said that "...Carnegie never wanted to see or touch these bonds that represented the fruition of his business career. It was as if he feared that if he looked upon them they might vanish like the gossamer gold of the leprechaun. Let them lie safe in a vault in New Jersey, safe from the New York tax assessors, until he was ready to dispose of them..." 

Carnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended English poet <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a>, English philosopher <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>, and American humorist <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>, as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Presidents</a>, statesmen, and notable writers.

Carnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in <a href="Dunfermline">Dunfermline</a> in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave £8,000 for the establishment of a <a href="Dunfermline%20Carnegie%20Library">Dunfermline Carnegie Library</a> in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to <a href="Bellevue%20Hospital%20Medical%20College">Bellevue Hospital Medical College</a> (now part of <a href="New%20York%20University%20Medical%20Center">New York University Medical Center</a>) to found a <a href="histology">histological</a> laboratory, now called the <a href="Carnegie%20Laboratory">Carnegie Laboratory</a>.

In 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a <a href="Carnegie%20library">Carnegie library</a> which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with <a href="Samuel%20Storey">Samuel Storey</a>, he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of "the British Republic". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>.

In 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled "<a href="An%20American%20Four-in-hand%20in%20Britain">An American Four-in-hand in Britain</a>".
Although actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably "<a href="Nineteenth%20Century%20%28periodical%29">The Nineteenth Century</a>", under the editorship of <a href="James%20Knowles%20%28architect%29">James Knowles</a>, and the influential "North American Review", led by editor <a href="Lloyd%20Bryce">Lloyd Bryce</a>.

In 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled "<a href="Triumphant%20Democracy">Triumphant Democracy</a>". Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British <a href="monarchy">monarchical</a> system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal <a href="Crown%20%28headgear%29">crown</a> and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.

In 1889, Carnegie published "Wealth" in the June issue of the "North American Review". After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as "The Gospel of Wealth" in the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>". Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.

Carnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.

While Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he very strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, almost to the point of supporting <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the <a href="Filipino%20people">Filipino people</a> could buy their independence from the United States. However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the <a href="American%20Anti-Imperialist%20League">American Anti-Imperialist League</a>, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> and literary figures like <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>.

Carnegie spent his last years as a philanthropist. From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in "Triumphant Democracy" (1886) and "<a href="Gospel%20of%20Wealth">Gospel of Wealth</a>" (1889). Carnegie bought <a href="Skibo%20Castle">Skibo Castle</a> in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie%20Mansion">New York mansion</a> located at 2 East <a href="91st%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">91st Street</a> at <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>. The building was built in 1903 and he lived there until his death and Louise until her death in 1946. The building is now the <a href="Cooper-Hewitt%2C%20National%20Design%20Museum">Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum</a>, part of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. The surrounding neighborhood on Manhattan's <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a> has come to be called <a href="Carnegie%20Hill">Carnegie Hill</a>. The mansion was named a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1966. He then devoted his life to providing the capital for purposes of public interest and social and educational advancement.

He was a powerful supporter of the movement for <a href="spelling%20reform">spelling reform</a> as a means of promoting the spread of the English language. His organisation, the <a href="Simplified%20Spelling%20Board">Simplified Spelling Board</a>, created the "Handbook of Simplified Spelling", which was written wholly in reformed spelling.

Among his many philanthropic efforts, the establishment of <a href="public%20library">public libraries</a> throughout the United States, Britain, Canada and other English-speaking countries was especially prominent. In this special driving interest and project of his he was inspired by a visit and tour he made with <a href="Enoch%20Pratt">Enoch Pratt</a> (1808–1896), formerly of Massachusetts but who made his fortune in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> and ran his various mercantile and financial businesses very thriftily. Pratt in turn had been inspired and helped by his friend and fellow Bay Stater, <a href="George%20Peabody">George Peabody</a>, (1795–1869) who also had made his fortune in the "Monumental City" of Baltimore before moving to New York and London to expand his empire as the richest man in America before the Civil War. Later he too endowed several institutions, schools, libraries and foundations in his home commonwealth, and also in Baltimore with his <a href="Peabody%20Institute">Peabody Institute</a> in 1857, completed in 1866, with added library wings a decade later and several educational foundations throughout the Old South. Several decades later, Carnegie's visit with Mr. Pratt lasted for several days; resting and dining in his city mansion, then touring, visiting and talking with staff and ordinary citizen patrons of the newly established <a href="Enoch%20Pratt%20Free%20Library">Enoch Pratt Free Library</a> (1886) impressed the Scotsman deeply – years later he was always heard to proclaim that "Pratt was my guide and inspiration".
The first <a href="Carnegie%20library">Carnegie library</a> opened in 1883 in Dunfermline. His method was to build and equip, but only on condition that the local authority matched that by providing the land and a budget for operation and maintenance. To secure local interest, in 1885, he gave $500,000 to Pittsburgh for a public library, and in 1886, he gave $250,000 to Allegheny City for a music hall and library; and $250,000 to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> for a free library. In total Carnegie funded some 3,000 libraries, located in 47 US states, and also in Canada, the United Kingdom, what is now the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, and <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>. He also donated £50,000 to help set up the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a> in 1899. In the early 20th century, a decade after Mr. Pratt's death, when expansion and city revenues grew tight, Carnegie returned the favor and endowed a large sum to permit the building of many Carnegie Libraries in the Enoch Pratt system in Baltimore and enabled EPFL to expand through the next quarter-century to meet the needs of the growing city and supply neighborhood branches for its annexed suburbs.

As Van Slyck (1991) showed, the last years of the 19th century saw acceptance of the idea that free libraries should be available to the American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.

In 1900, Carnegie gave $2 million to start the <a href="Carnegie%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Carnegie Institute of Technology</a> (CIT) at Pittsburgh and the same amount in 1902 to found the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution">Carnegie Institution</a> at Washington, D.C. He later contributed more to these and other schools. CIT is now known as <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> after it merged with the <a href="Mellon%20Institute%20of%20Industrial%20Research">Mellon Institute of Industrial Research</a>. Carnegie also served on the Boards of <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> and <a href="Stevens%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>.

In 1911, Carnegie became a sympathetic benefactor to <a href="George%20Ellery%20Hale">George Ellery Hale</a>, who was trying to build the <a href="Hooker%20telescope">Hooker Telescope</a> at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson</a>, and donated an additional ten million dollars to the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20for%20Science">Carnegie Institution</a> with the following suggestion to expedite the construction of the telescope: "I hope the work at Mount Wilson will be vigorously pushed, because I am so anxious to hear the expected results from it. I should like to be satisfied before I depart, that we are going to repay to the old land some part of the debt we owe them by revealing more clearly than ever to them the new heavens." The telescope saw <a href="First%20light%20%28astronomy%29">first light</a> on November 2, 1917, with Carnegie still alive.

In 1901, in Scotland, he gave $10 million to establish the <a href="Carnegie%20Trust%20for%20the%20Universities%20of%20Scotland">Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland</a>. It was created by a deed which he signed on June 7, 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The establishing gift of $10 million was, then, an unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year. The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university. He was subsequently elected <a href="Lord%20Rector">Lord Rector</a> of <a href="University%20of%20St.%20Andrews">University of St. Andrews</a> in December 1901. He also donated large sums of money to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became <a href="Pittencrieff%20Park">Pittencrieff Park</a> and opened it to all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him stands there today.

He gave a further $10 million in 1913 to endow the <a href="Carnegie%20United%20Kingdom%20Trust">Carnegie United Kingdom Trust</a>, a grant-making foundation. He transferred to the trust the charge of all his existing and future benefactions, other than university benefactions in the United Kingdom. He gave the trustees a wide discretion, and they inaugurated a policy of financing rural library schemes rather than erecting library buildings, and of assisting the musical education of the people rather than granting organs to churches.

In 1901, Carnegie also established large pension funds for his former employees at Homestead and, in 1905, for American college professors. The latter fund evolved into <a href="TIAA-CREF">TIAA-CREF</a>. One critical requirement was that church-related schools had to sever their religious connections to get his money.

His interest in music led him to fund construction of 7,000 church organs. He built and owned <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in New York City.

Carnegie was a large benefactor of the <a href="Tuskegee%20Institute">Tuskegee Institute</a> for African-American education under <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a>. He helped Washington create the <a href="National%20Negro%20Business%20League">National Negro Business League</a>.
In 1904, he founded the <a href="Carnegie%20Hero%20Fund">Carnegie Hero Fund</a> for the United States and Canada (a few years later also established in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Germany) for the recognition of deeds of heroism. Carnegie contributed $1,500,000 in 1903 for the erection of the <a href="Peace%20Palace">Peace Palace</a> at <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>; and he donated $150,000 for a <a href="Pan-American%20Palace">Pan-American Palace</a> in Washington as a home for the International Bureau of American Republics.

Carnegie was honored for his philanthropy and support of the arts by initiation as an honorary member of <a href="Phi%20Mu%20Alpha%20Sinfonia">Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> Fraternity on October 14, 1917, at the <a href="New%20England%20Conservatory">New England Conservatory of Music</a> in Boston, Massachusetts. The fraternity's mission reflects Carnegie's values by developing young men to share their talents to create harmony in the world.

By the standards of 19th century tycoons, Carnegie was not a particularly ruthless man but a humanitarian with enough acquisitiveness to go in the ruthless pursuit of money. "Maybe with the giving away of his money," commented biographer <a href="Joseph%20Frazier%20Wall">Joseph Wall</a>, "he would justify what he had done to get that money."

To some, Carnegie represents the idea of the American dream. He was an immigrant from Scotland who came to America and became successful. He is not only known for his successes but his enormous amounts of philanthropist works, not only to charities but also to promote democracy and independence to colonized countries.

Carnegie died on August 11, 1919, in <a href="Lenox%2C%20Massachusetts">Lenox, Massachusetts</a> at his <a href="Shadow%20Brook%20Farm%20Historic%20District">Shadow Brook</a> estate, of bronchial pneumonia. He had already given away $350,695,653 (approximately $76.9 billion, adjusted to 2015 share of GDP figures) of his wealth. After his death, his last $30,000,000 was given to foundations, charities, and to pensioners. He was buried at the <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%20Cemetery">Sleepy Hollow Cemetery</a> in <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">North Tarrytown, New York</a>. The grave site is located on the Arcadia Hebron plot of land at the corner of Summit Avenue and Dingle Road. Carnegie is buried only a few yards away from union organizer <a href="Samuel%20Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a>, another important figure of industry in the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a>.

Carnegie was one of more than 50 members of the <a href="South%20Fork%20Fishing%20and%20Hunting%20Club">South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club</a>, which has been blamed for the <a href="Johnstown%20Flood">Johnstown Flood</a> that killed 2,209 people in 1889.

At the suggestion of his friend Benjamin Ruff, Carnegie's partner <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a> had formed the exclusive South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club high above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a>, his attorneys <a href="Philander%20Knox">Philander Knox</a> and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the <a href="South%20Fork%20Dam">South Fork Dam</a> was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Less than 20 miles downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown.

The dam was high and long. Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley causing the Johnstown Flood. When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.

Although Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.

The <a href="Homestead%20Strike">Homestead Strike</a> was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in <a href="Homestead%2C%20Pennsylvania">Homestead, Pennsylvania</a>, and grew out of a dispute between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the Carnegie Steel Company.

Carnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked. In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a>. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities.

After a recent increase in profits by 60%, the company refused to raise workers' pay by more than 30%. When some of the workers demanded the full 60%, management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a "<a href="lockout%20%28industry%29">lockout</a>" by management and not a "strike" by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing <a href="Labor%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">labor rights movement</a>, strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and <a href="Pinkerton%20National%20Detective%20Agency">Pinkerton</a> agents to safeguard them.

On July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men—seven strikers and three Pinkertons—were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor <a href="Robert%20E.%20Pattison">Robert Pattison</a> ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding Frick. While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt. According to Berkman, "...with the elimination of Frick, responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie." Afterwards, the company successfully resumed operations with non-union immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers, and Carnegie returned to the United States. However, Carnegie's reputation was permanently damaged by the Homestead events.

In his final days, Carnegie suffered from pneumonia. Before his death on August 11, 1919, Carnegie had donated $350,695,654 for various causes. The "Andrew Carnegie Dictum" was:
Carnegie was involved in philanthropic causes, but he kept himself away from religious circles. He wanted to be identified by the world as a "<a href="positivist">positivist</a>". He was highly influenced in public life by <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>.

As early as 1868, at age 33, he drafted a memo to himself. He wrote: "...The amassing of wealth is one of the worse species of idolatry. No idol more debasing than the worship of money." In order to avoid degrading himself, he wrote in the same memo he would retire at age 35 to pursue the practice of philanthropic giving for "...the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced." However, he did not begin his philanthropic work in all earnest until 1881, with the gift of a library to his hometown of Dunfermline, Scotland.

Carnegie wrote "<a href="The%20Gospel%20of%20Wealth">The Gospel of Wealth</a>", an article in which he stated his belief that the rich should use their wealth to help enrich society. In that article, Carnegie also expressed sympathy for the ideas of <a href="progressive%20tax">progressive tax</a>ation and an <a href="inheritance%20tax">estate tax</a>.

The following is taken from one of Carnegie's memos to himself: 

Carnegie claimed to be a champion of evolutionary thought particularly the work of <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>, even declaring Spencer his teacher. Though Carnegie claims to be a disciple of Spencer many of his actions went against the ideas espoused by Spencer.

Spencerian evolution was for individual rights and against government interference. Furthermore, Spencerian evolution held that those unfit to sustain themselves must be allowed to perish. Spencer believed that just as there were many varieties of beetles, respectively modified to existence in a particular place in nature, so too had human society "spontaneously fallen into division of labour". Individuals who survived to this, the latest and highest stage of evolutionary progress would be "those in whom the power of self-preservation is the greatest—are the select of their generation." Moreover, Spencer perceived governmental authority as borrowed from the people to perform the transitory aims of establishing social cohesion, insurance of rights, and security. Spencerian 'survival of the fittest' firmly credits any provisions made to assist the weak, unskilled, poor and distressed to be an imprudent disservice to evolution. Spencer insisted people should resist for the benefit of collective humanity, as severe fate singles out the weak, debauched, and disabled.

Andrew Carnegie's political and economic focus during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century was the defense of laissez faire economics. Carnegie emphatically resisted government intrusion in commerce, as well as government-sponsored charities. Carnegie believed the concentration of capital was essential for societal progress and should be encouraged. Carnegie was an ardent supporter of commercial "survival of the fittest" and sought to attain immunity from business challenges by dominating all phases of the steel manufacturing procedure. Carnegie's determination to lower costs included cutting labor expenses as well. In a notably Spencerian manner, Carnegie argued that unions impeded the natural reduction of prices by pushing up costs, which blocked evolutionary progress. Carnegie felt that unions represented the narrow interest of the few while his actions benefited the entire community.

On the surface, Andrew Carnegie appears to be a strict laissez-faire capitalist and follower of Herbert Spencer, often referring to himself as a disciple of Spencer. Conversely, Carnegie a titan of industry seems to embody all of the qualities of Spencerian survival of the fittest. The two men enjoyed a mutual respect for one another and maintained correspondence until Spencer's death in 1903. There are however, some major discrepancies between Spencer's capitalist evolutionary conceptions and Andrew Carnegie's capitalist practices.

Spencer wrote that in production the advantages of the superior individual are comparatively minor, and thus acceptable, yet the benefit that dominance provides those who control a large segment of production might be hazardous to competition. Spencer feared that an absence of "sympathetic self-restraint" of those with too much power could lead to the ruin of their competitors. He did not think free market competition necessitated competitive warfare. Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of "commercial murder". Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies. Over the course of twenty years, Carnegie's steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, the Lucy Furnace Works, the Union Iron Mills, the Homestead Works, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines among many other industry related assets. Furthermore, Carnegie's success was due to his convenient relationship with the railroad industries, which not only relied on steel for track, but were also making money from steel transport. The steel and railroad barons worked closely to negotiate prices instead of free market competition determinations.

Besides Carnegie's market manipulation, United States trade tariffs were also working in favor of the steel industry. Carnegie spent energy and resources lobbying congress for a continuation of favorable tariffs from which he earned millions of dollars a year. Carnegie tried to keep this information concealed, but legal documents released in 1900, during proceedings with the ex-chairman of Carnegie Steel, Henry Clay Frick, revealed how favorable the tariffs had been. Herbert Spencer absolutely was against government interference in business in the form of regulatory limitation, taxes, and tariffs as well. Spencer saw tariffs as a form of taxation that levied against the majority in service to "the benefit of a small minority of manufacturers and artisans".

Despite Carnegie's personal dedication to Herbert Spencer as a friend, his adherence to Spencer's political and economic ideas is more contentious. In particular, it appears Carnegie either misunderstood or intentionally misrepresented some of Spencer's principal arguments. Spencer remarked upon his first visit to Carnegie's steel mills in Pittsburgh, which Carnegie saw as the manifestation of Spencer's philosophy, "Six months' residence here would justify suicide."

On the subject of charity Andrew Carnegie's actions diverged in the most significant and complex manner from Herbert Spencer's philosophies. In his 1854 essay "Manners and Fashion", Spencer referred to public education as "Old schemes". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, "political, religious, literary, philanthropic", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its "original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism". Spencer insisted that all forms of philanthropy that uplift the poor and downtrodden were reckless and incompetent. Spencer thought any attempt to prevent "the really salutary sufferings" of the less fortunate "bequeath to posterity a continually increasing curse". Carnegie, a self-proclaimed devotee of Spencer, testified to Congress on February 5, 1915: "My business is to do as much good in the world as I can; I have retired from all other business."

Carnegie held that societal progress relied on individuals who maintained moral obligations to themselves and to society. Furthermore, he believed that charity supplied the means for those who wish to improve themselves to achieve their goals. Carnegie urged other wealthy people to contribute to society in the form of parks, works of art, libraries and other endeavors that improve the community and contribute to the "lasting good". Carnegie also held a strong opinion against inherited wealth. Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers. By leaving large sums of money to their children, wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society. Most notably, Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor. Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom. He believed the poor possessed an advantage over the wealthy because they receive greater attention from their parents and are taught better work ethics.

Carnegie and his family belonged to the <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Presbyterian Church in the United States of America</a>, also known informally as the Northern Presbyterian Church. In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>, and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life. In his autobiography, Carnegie describes his family as moderate <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> believers, writing that "there was not one orthodox Presbyterian" in his family; various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism, some of them leaning more towards <a href="Swedenborgianism">Swedenborgianism</a>. Though, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.

Witnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism. Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, "Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution."

Later in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of <a href="Madison%20Avenue%20Presbyterian%20Church">Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church</a>, pastored from 1905 to 1926 by <a href="Social%20Gospel">Social Gospel</a> exponent <a href="Henry%20Sloane%20Coffin">Henry Sloane Coffin</a>, while his wife and daughter belonged to the <a href="Brick%20Presbyterian%20Church">Brick Presbyterian Church</a>. He also prepared (but did not deliver) an address in which he professed a belief in "an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed". Records exist of a short period of correspondence around 1912–1913 between Carnegie and <a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a>, the eldest son of <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a>, founder of the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>. In these letters, one of which was published in the "New York Times" in full text, Carnegie is extolled as a "lover of the world of humanity and one of the founders of Universal Peace".

Influenced by his "favorite living hero in public life" <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>, Carnegie started his efforts in pursuit of world peace at a young age. His motto, "All is well since all grows better", served not only as a good rationalization of his successful business career, but also his view of international relations.

Despite his efforts towards international peace, Carnegie faced many dilemmas on his quest. These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.

Despite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for than newly-established <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Arbitration">International Court of Arbitration</a>'s <a href="Peace%20Palace">Peace Palace</a> - brainchild of Russian Tsar <a href="Nicolas%20II">Nicolas II</a>.

In 1913, at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was ‘‘as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.’’

In 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.

Despite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the <a href="Carnegie%20Council%20for%20Ethics%20in%20International%20Affairs">Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs</a>, an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.

The outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a> and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> after his death, which took world peace to another level.

On the matter of American colonial expansion, Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the annexation of the Hawaiian islands or Puerto Rico, but he opposed the annexation of the Philippines. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence. This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.

After he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer <a href="William%20T.%20Stead">William T. Stead</a>, asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:

Carnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.

Like Stead, he believed that the United States and the British Empire would merge into one nation, telling him "We are heading straight to the Re-United States". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament. The creation of the <a href="Carnegie%20Endowment%20for%20International%20Peace">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a> in 1910 was regarded as a milestone on the road to the ultimate goal of abolition of war. Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the "scientific" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.

Carnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues. In addition to "<a href="Triumphant%20Democracy">Triumphant Democracy</a>" (1886), and "<a href="The%20Gospel%20of%20Wealth">The Gospel of Wealth</a>" (1889), he also wrote "Our Coaching Trip, Brighton to Inverness" (1882), "<a href="An%20American%20Four-in-hand%20in%20Britain">An American Four-in-hand in Britain</a>" (1883), "<a href="Round%20the%20World">Round the World</a>" (1884), "<a href="The%20Empire%20of%20Business">The Empire of Business</a>" (1902), "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Business%20is%20the%20Management%20of%20Men">The Secret of Business is the Management of Men</a>" (1903) "<a href="James%20Watt%20%28biography%29">James Watt</a>" (1905) in the <a href="List%20of%20books%20for%20the%20%26quot%3BFamous%20Scots%20Series%26quot%3B">Famous Scots Series</a>, "<a href="Problems%20of%20Today">Problems of Today</a>" (1907), and his posthumously published "Autobiography of Andrew Carnegie" (1920).

Carnegie received the honorary <a href="Legum%20Doctor">Doctor of Laws</a> (DLL) from the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> in June 1901, and received the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freedom of the City</a> of <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> "″in recognition of his munificence″" later the same year. In July 1902 he received the Freedom of the city of <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a>, "″in testimony of his great zeal for the welfare of his fellow-men on both sides of the Atlantic.″"


Carnegie's personal papers are at the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> Manuscript Division.
The Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare pageRank.Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a> (CCNY); The <a href="Carnegie%20Endowment%20for%20International%20Peace">Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</a> (CEIP); the <a href="Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching">Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching</a> (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA).

Approximant consonant

Approximants are <a href="phone%20%28phonetics%29">speech sounds</a> that involve the <a href="Speech%20organ">articulators</a> approaching each other but not narrowly enough nor with enough articulatory precision to create turbulent airflow. Therefore, approximants fall between <a href="fricative%20consonant">fricatives</a>, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s, which produce no turbulence. This class of sounds includes <a href="Lateral%20consonant">lateral</a> approximants like (as in "less"), non-lateral approximants like (as in "rest"), and <a href="semivowels">semivowels</a> like and (as in "yes" and "west", respectively).

Before <a href="Peter%20Ladefoged">Peter Ladefoged</a> coined the term "approximant" in the 1960s, the term "frictionless continuant" referred to non-lateral approximants.

Some approximants resemble vowels in acoustic and articulatory properties and the terms "<a href="semivowel">semivowel</a>" and "glide" are often used for these non-syllabic vowel-like segments. The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels.

Vowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with <a href="Indo-European%20ablaut">Indo-European ablaut</a>. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel. A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, remarks that, for example, the final glides of English "par" and "buy" differ from French "par" ('through') and "baille" ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the <a href="syllable%20coda">syllable coda</a>, whereas, in the former, they appear in the <a href="syllable%20nucleus">syllable nucleus</a>. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> (with the i-like sound of "piede" 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: , and that of "piano" 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: ) and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being "abyecto" 'abject' and "abierto" 'opened').

In articulation and often diachronically, <a href="palatal%20consonant">palatal</a> approximants correspond to <a href="front%20vowel">front vowel</a>s, <a href="velar%20consonant">velar</a> approximants to <a href="back%20vowel">back vowel</a>s, and labialized approximants to <a href="rounded%20vowel">rounded vowel</a>s. In American English, the <a href="rhotic%20consonant">rhotic</a> approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table).

In addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus. For example, in <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a>, medial triggers the formation of an inserted that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix is added to футбол ('football') to make футболіст 'football player', it is pronounced , but маоїст ('<a href="Maoist">Maoist</a>'), with the same affix, is pronounced with a glide. <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> for many speakers has a similar process that extends to mid vowels:

Similarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. <a href="Sievers%27%20law">Sievers' law</a> describes this behaviour for <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a>.

Non-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial <a href="Nepali%20language">Nepali</a> speech, a process of <a href="glide-formation">glide-formation</a> occurs, where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; the process includes mid vowels so that ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel. Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic can occur so that "ahorita" ('right away') is pronounced . It is not often clear, however, whether such sequences involve a semivowel (a consonant) or a diphthong (a vowel), and in many cases, it may not be a meaningful distinction.

Although many languages have <a href="central%20vowel">central vowel</a>s , which lie between back/velar and front/palatal , there are few cases of a corresponding approximant . One is in the Korean diphthong or though it is more frequently analyzed as velar (as in the table above), and <a href="Mapudungun">Mapudungun</a> may be another, with three high vowel sounds, , , and three corresponding consonants, , and , and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative; some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and that is parallel to – and –. An example is "liq" (?) ('white').

In addition to less turbulence, approximants also differ from fricatives in the precision required to produce them. 
When emphasized, approximants may be slightly fricated (that is, the airstream may become slightly turbulent), which is reminiscent of fricatives. For example, the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> word "ayuda" ('help') features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech. Spanish can be analyzed as having a meaningful distinction between fricative, approximant, and intermediate . However, such frication is generally slight and intermittent, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants.

Because voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs, the increased air flow creates more turbulence, making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants (which are extremely rare cross-linguistically) and voiceless fricatives difficult. This is why, for example, the voiceless labialized velar approximant (also transcribed with the special letter ) has traditionally been labeled a fricative, and no language is known to contrast it with a voiceless labialized velar fricative . Similarly, <a href="Standard%20Tibetan">Standard Tibetan</a> has a voiceless <a href="Lateral%20consonant">lateral</a> approximant, , and <a href="Welsh%20phonology">Welsh</a> has a voiceless lateral fricative , but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages. Again, no language is known to contrast the two. <a href="Iaai%20language">Iaai</a> is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants, with .

For places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore, the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, with or without a lowering <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>.

Occasionally, the glottal "fricatives" are called approximants, since typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often <a href="phonation">phonation</a>s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation.


In lateral approximants, the center of tongue makes solid contact with the roof of the mouth. However, the defining location is the side of the tongue, which only approaches the teeth.



Voiceless approximants are rarely distinguished from voiceless fricatives. <a href="Iaai%20language">Iaai</a> has an unusually large number of them, with contrasting with (as well as a large number of <a href="voiceless%20nasal">voiceless nasal</a>s). Attested voiceless approximants are:


Examples are:

In <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, the nasal glides and historically became and in some words. In the <a href="Edo%20language">Edo</a>, the nasalized allophones of the approximants and are nasal occlusives, and .

What are transcribed as nasal approximants may include non-syllabic elements of <a href="nasal%20vowel">nasal vowel</a>s or diphthongs.

Aeon

The word aeon , also spelled eon (<a href="American%20English">in American English</a>) and æon, originally meant "life", "vital force" or "being", "generation" or "a period of time", though it tended to be translated as "age" in the sense of "ages", "forever", "timeless" or "for <a href="eternity">eternity</a>". It is a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> transliteration from the <a href="koine%20Greek">koine Greek</a> word ("ho aion"), from the archaic ("aiwon"). In <a href="Homer">Homer</a> it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word "<a href="Kalpa%20%28aeon%29">kalpa</a>" and <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> word "<a href="olam%20%28disambiguation%29">olam</a>". A <a href="cognate">cognate</a> <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> word "aevum" or "aeuum" (cf. ) for "age" is present in words such as "longevity" and "mediaeval".

Although the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> or <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite, period. Aeon can also refer to the four aeons on the <a href="Geologic%20Time%20Scale">Geologic Time Scale</a> that make up the Earth's history, the <a href="Hadean">Hadean</a>, <a href="Archean">Archean</a>, <a href="Proterozoic">Proterozoic</a>, and the current aeon <a href="Phanerozoic">Phanerozoic</a>.

In astronomy an aeon is defined as a billion years (10 years, abbreviated AE).
<a href="Roger%20Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> uses the word "aeon" to describe the period between successive and cyclic <a href="big%20bang">big bang</a>s within the context of <a href="conformal%20cyclic%20cosmology">conformal cyclic cosmology</a>.

The <a href="Bible">Bible</a> translation is a treatment of the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> word "olam" and the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "aion". Both these words have similar meaning, and <a href="Young%27s%20Literal%20Translation">Young's Literal Translation</a> renders them and their derivatives as “age” or “age-during”. Other <a href="English%20language">English</a> versions most often translate them to indicate eternity, being translated as eternal, everlasting, forever, etc. However, there are notable exceptions to this in all major translations, such as : “…I am with you always, to the end of the age” (NRSV), the word “age” being a translation of "aion". Rendering "aion" to indicate eternality in this verse would result in the contradictory phrase “end of eternity”, so the question arises whether it should ever be so. Proponents of <a href="universal%20reconciliation">universal reconciliation</a> point out that this has significant implications for the <a href="problem%20of%20hell">problem of hell</a>. Contrast in well-known English translations with its rendering in Young's Literal Translation:

And these shall go away to punishment age-during, but the righteous to life age-during. (YLT)

Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life. (<a href="New%20International%20Version">NIV</a>)

These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. (<a href="New%20American%20Standard%20Bible">NASB</a>)

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. (<a href="King%20James%20Version">KJV</a>)

And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life. (<a href="New%20World%20Translation">NWT</a>)

<a href="Plato">Plato</a> used the word "aeon" to denote the eternal world of ideas, which he conceived was "behind" the perceived world, as demonstrated in his famous <a href="allegory%20of%20the%20cave">allegory of the cave</a>.

<a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>'s idea of "<a href="Eternal%20life%20%28Christianity%29">eternal life</a>" comes from the word for life, "zoe", and a form of "aeon", which could mean life in the next aeon, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20God">Kingdom of God</a>, or <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>, just as much as immortality, as in .

According to the Christian doctrine of <a href="universal%20reconciliation">universal reconciliation</a>, the <a href="Novum%20Testamentum%20Graece">Greek New Testament</a> scriptures use the word "aeon" to mean a long period (perhaps 1000 years) and the word "aeonian" to mean "during a long period"; Thus there was a time before the aeons, and the aeonian period is finite. After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of aeonian life or aeonian punishment. That is, after the period of the aeons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one (). This contrasts with the conventional Christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment.

<a href="Occult">Occult</a>ists of the <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a> and <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">O.T.O.</a> traditions sometimes speak of a "magical Aeon" that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.

<a href="Order%20of%20Nine%20Angles">The Order of Nine Angles</a>, A UK-based <a href="Left-hand%20path%20and%20right-hand%20path">Left Hand Path</a>/<a href="Satanism">Satanic</a> organisation propose the concept of Aeons are central to the esoteric philosophy developed by the pseudonymous Anton Long, who wrote that "an aeon is the term used [by the O9A] to describe a stage or a type of evolution. Evolution itself is taken to result from a certain speciﬁc process - and this process can be described, or explained [or 're-presented' ] via a bifurcation of time. That is, evolution is an expression of how the cosmos changes over or through or because of,'time' - this 'time' having two components. These two components are the causal and the acausal [...]

"An aeon is a manifestation, in the causal, of a particular type of acausal energy. Thisenergy re-orders, or changes, the causal. These changes have certain limits - in bothcausal space and causal time. That is, they have a speciﬁc beginning and a speciﬁcend. A civilization (or rather, a higher or aeonic-civilization) is how this energybecomes ordered or manifests itself in the causal: how this energy is revealed. A civilization represents the practical changes which this energy causes in the causal -in terms of the eﬀect such energy has on individuals and this planet. A civilization is tied to, is born from, a particular aeon. By the nature of this energy, a civilization isan evolution of life - a move toward a more complex, and thus more conscious existence [...]"

Aeon may also be an archaic name for omnipotent beings, such as gods.

In many <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> systems, the various <a href="emanationism">emanations</a> of <a href="God">God</a>, who is also known by such names as the One, the <a href="Monad%20%28Gnosticism%29">Monad</a>, "Aion teleos" ( "The Broadest Aeon"), <a href="Bythos">Bythos</a> ("depth or profundity", Greek ), "Proarkhe" ("before the beginning", Greek ), the "Arkhe" ("the beginning", Greek ), "Sophia" (wisdom), Christos (the Anointed One) are called "Aeons". In the different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but the emanation theory itself is common to all forms of Gnosticism.

In the <a href="Basilidian">Basilidian</a> Gnosis they are called sonships (υἱότητες "huiotetes"; sing.: "huiotes"); according to <a href="Marcosians">Marcus</a>, they are numbers and sounds; in <a href="Valentinianism">Valentinianism</a> they form male/female pairs called "syzygies" (Greek , from σύζυγοι "syzygoi").

Similarly, in the Greek Magical Papyri, the term "Aion" is often used to denote the All, or the supreme aspect of God.

Airline

An airline is a company that provides <a href="civil%20aviation">air transport services</a> for traveling <a href="passenger">passenger</a>s and <a href="freight">freight</a>. Airlines utilize <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a> to supply these services and may form <a href="partnership">partnership</a>s or <a href="Airline%20alliance">alliances</a> with other airlines for <a href="codeshare%20agreement">codeshare agreement</a>s. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an <a href="Air%20operator%27s%20certificate">air operating certificate</a> or license issued by a governmental aviation body.

Airlines vary in size, from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines. Airline services can be categorized as being intercontinental, domestic, regional, or international, and may be operated as scheduled services or <a href="Air%20charter">charters</a>. The <a href="World%27s%20largest%20airlines">largest airline</a> currently is <a href="American%20Airlines%20Group">American Airlines Group</a>.

<a href="DELAG">DELAG</a>, "Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft" was the <a href="List%20of%20airlines%20by%20foundation">world's first airline</a>. It was founded on November 16, 1909, with government assistance, and operated airships manufactured by The <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin Corporation</a>. Its headquarters were in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>. The first fixed wing scheduled air service was started on January 1, 1914, from <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, to <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. The four <a href="List%20of%20airlines%20by%20foundation">oldest non-dirigible airlines</a> that still exist are Netherlands' <a href="KLM">KLM</a> (1919), Colombia's <a href="Avianca">Avianca</a> (1919), Australia's <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> (1921), and the Czech Republic's <a href="Czech%20Airlines">Czech Airlines</a> (1923).

The earliest fixed wing airline in Europe was the <a href="Aircraft%20Transport%20and%20Travel">Aircraft Transport and Travel</a>, formed by <a href="George%20Holt%20Thomas">George Holt Thomas</a> in 1916. Using a fleet of former military <a href="Airco%20DH.4">Airco DH.4</a>A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a>, it operated relief flights between <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> and <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a> between <a href="RAF%20Hendon">RAF Hendon</a> and <a href="Paris%20%E2%80%93%20Le%20Bourget%20Airport">Paris – Le Bourget Airport</a>, the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at £21 per passenger.

On 25 August 1919, the company used <a href="Airco%20DH.16">DH.16s</a> to pioneer a regular service from <a href="Hounslow%20Heath%20Aerodrome">Hounslow Heath Aerodrome</a> to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil <a href="airmail">airmail</a> contract. Six <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="Airco%20DH.9A">Airco DH.9A</a> aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between <a href="Hawkinge">Hawkinge</a> and <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.

Other British competitors were quick to follow – <a href="Handley%20Page%20Transport">Handley Page Transport</a> was established in 1919 and used the company's converted <a href="World%20War%20One">wartime</a> <a href="Handley%20Page%20Type%20O">Type O/400</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s with a capacity for 19 passengers, to run a <a href="London">London</a>-<a href="Paris">Paris</a> passenger service.

The first French airline was <a href="A%C3%A9ropostale%20%28aviation%29">Société des lignes Latécoère</a>, later known as Aéropostale, which started its first service in late 1918 to Spain. The <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20des%20Transports%20A%C3%A9riens">Société Générale des Transports Aériens</a> was created in late 1919, by the <a href="Farman">Farman</a> brothers and the <a href="Farman%20F.60%20Goliath">Farman F.60 Goliath</a> plane flew scheduled services from <a href="Toussus-le-Noble">Toussus-le-Noble</a> to <a href="Kenley">Kenley</a>, near <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>, England. Another early French airline was the <a href="Compagnie%20des%20Messageries%20A%C3%A9riennes">Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes</a>, established in 1919 by <a href="Louis-Charles%20Breguet">Louis-Charles Breguet</a>, offering a mail and freight service between <a href="Paris%20%E2%80%93%20Le%20Bourget%20Airport">Le Bourget Airport</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="Lesquin%20Airport">Lesquin Airport</a>, <a href="Lille">Lille</a>.
The first German airline to use heavier than air aircraft was <a href="Deutsche%20Luft-Reederei">Deutsche Luft-Reederei</a> established in 1917 which started operating in February 1919. In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000 km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was <a href="Junkers%20Luftverkehr">Junkers Luftverkehr</a>, which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer <a href="Junkers">Junkers</a>, which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.
The <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> airline <a href="KLM">KLM</a> made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world. Established by aviator <a href="Albert%20Plesman">Albert Plesman</a>, it was immediately awarded a "Royal" predicate from <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Queen Wilhelmina</a>. Its first flight was from <a href="Croydon%20Airport">Croydon Airport</a>, <a href="London">London</a> to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, using a leased <a href="Aircraft%20Transport%20and%20Travel">Aircraft Transport and Travel</a> <a href="Airco%20DH.16">DH-16</a>, and carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.

In <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now <a href="Finnair">Finnair</a>) was signed in the city of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> on September 12, 1923. <a href="Junkers%20F.13">Junkers F.13</a> D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>, capital of <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.

In the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name <a href="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a>.

Early European airlines tend to favour comfort – the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors – over speed and efficiency. The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace.

By the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, <a href="Imperial%20Airways">Imperial Airways</a> was formed from the merger of <a href="Instone%20Air%20Line">Instone Air Line Company</a>, <a href="British%20Marine%20Air%20Navigation%20Co%20Ltd">British Marine Air Navigation</a>, <a href="Daimler%20Airway">Daimler Airway</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Transport">Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.</a>, to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and to enhance trade and integration.

The first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the <a href="Handley%20Page%20W8f">Handley Page W8f</a> "City of Washington", delivered on 3 November 1924. In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%281925%20film%29">The Lost World</a>" became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.

Two French airlines also merged to form <a href="Air%20Union">Air Union</a> on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>, the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.

Germany's <a href="Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa">Deutsche Luft Hansa</a> was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them <a href="Junkers%20Luftverkehr">Junkers Luftverkehr</a>. Luft Hansa, due to the <a href="Hugo%20Junkers">Junkers</a> heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to <a href="Varig">Varig</a> and Avianca. German airliners built by <a href="Junkers%20%28Aircraft%29">Junkers</a>, <a href="Dornier%20GmbH">Dornier</a>, and <a href="Fokker">Fokker</a> were among the most advanced in the world at the time.

In 1926, <a href="Alan%20Cobham">Alan Cobham</a> surveyed a flight route from the UK to <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, following this up with another proving flight to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Other routes to <a href="British%20India">British India</a> and the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="Basra">Basra</a> began in 1927 and were extended to <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> in 1929. The London-<a href="Australia">Australia</a> service was inaugurated in 1932 with the <a href="Handley%20Page%20HP%2042">Handley Page HP 42</a> airliners. Further services were opened up to <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> and <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.

Like Imperial Airways, <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a> and <a href="KLM">KLM</a>'s early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions (<a href="French%20North%20Africa">North Africa</a> and <a href="French%20Indochina">Indochina</a> for the French and the <a href="Dutch%20Indies">East Indies</a> for the Dutch). France began an air mail service to <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed <a href="A%C3%A9ropostale%20%28aviation%29">Aéropostale</a>, and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, Aéropostale went <a href="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>, was nationalized and merged into <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>.

Although Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally. In 1931, the airship <a href="LZ%20127%20Graf%20Zeppelin">Graf Zeppelin</a> began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937. In 1936, the airship <a href="LZ%20129%20Hindenburg">Hindenburg</a> entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.

From February 1934 until World War II began in 1939 <a href="Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa">Deutsche Lufthansa</a> operated an airmail service from <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> via <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> and West Africa to <a href="Natal%2C%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Natal</a> in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. This was the first time an airline flew across an ocean.

By the end of the 1930s <a href="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> had become the world's largest airline, employing more than 4,000 pilots and 60,000 other service personnel and operating around 3,000 aircraft (of which 75% were considered obsolete by its own standards). During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-104">Tupolev Tu-104</a>.

Deregulation of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as <a href="EasyJet">EasyJet</a> and <a href="Ryanair">Ryanair</a> have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.

There has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for <a href="Aer%20Lingus">Aer Lingus</a> and <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>. Other national airlines, including Italy's <a href="Alitalia">Alitalia</a>, have suffered – particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.

<a href="Tony%20Jannus">Tony Jannus</a> conducted the United States' first scheduled commercial airline flight on 1 January 1914 for the <a href="St.%20Petersburg-Tampa%20Airboat%20Line">St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line</a>. The 23-minute flight traveled between <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a> and <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, passing some above Tampa Bay in Jannus' <a href="Benoist%20XIV">Benoist XIV</a> wood and muslin biplane flying boat. His passenger was a former mayor of St. Petersburg, who paid $400 for the privilege of sitting on a wooden bench in the open cockpit. The Airboat line operated for about four months, carrying more than 1,200 passengers who paid $5 each. <a href="Chalk%27s%20International%20Airlines">Chalk's International Airlines</a> began service between Miami and Bimini in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> in February 1919. Based in <a href="Ft.%20Lauderdale">Ft. Lauderdale</a>, Chalk's claimed to be the oldest continuously operating airline in the United States until its closure in 2008.

Following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the United States found itself swamped with aviators. Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> won the financial backing of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to begin experimenting with <a href="air%20mail">air mail</a> service, initially using <a href="Curtiss%20Jenny">Curtiss Jenny</a> aircraft that had been procured by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Service">United States Army Air Service</a>. Private operators were the first to fly the mail but due to numerous accidents the US Army was tasked with mail delivery. During the Army's involvement they proved to be too unreliable and lost their air mail duties. By the mid-1920s, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">Postal Service</a> had developed its own air mail network, based on a transcontinental backbone between <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>. To supplement this service, they offered twelve contracts for spur routes to independent bidders. Some of the carriers that won these routes would, through time and mergers, evolve into <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan Am</a>, <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="Braniff%20Airways">Braniff Airways</a>, <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> (originally a division of <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>), <a href="Trans%20World%20Airlines">Trans World Airlines</a>, <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a>, and <a href="Eastern%20Air%20Lines">Eastern Air Lines</a>.

Service during the early 1920s was sporadic: most airlines at the time were focused on <a href="airmail%23History">carrying bags of mail</a>. In 1925, however, the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> bought out the <a href="William%20Bushnell%20Stout">Stout Aircraft Company</a> and began construction of the all-metal <a href="Ford%20Trimotor">Ford Trimotor</a>, which became the first successful American airliner. With a 12-passenger capacity, the Trimotor made passenger service potentially profitable. Air service was seen as a supplement to <a href="rail%20transport">rail</a> service in the American transportation network.

At the same time, <a href="Juan%20Trippe">Juan Trippe</a> began a crusade to create an air network that would link America to the world, and he achieved this goal through his airline, <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan American World Airways</a>, with a fleet of flying boats that linked <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> and <a href="Boston">Boston</a> to <a href="London">London</a>. Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.

With the introduction of the <a href="Boeing%20247">Boeing 247</a> and <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a> in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. This trend continued until the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

As governments met to set the standards and scope for an emergent civil air industry toward the end of the war, the U.S. took a position of maximum operating freedom; U.S. airline companies were not as hard-hit as European and the few Asian ones had been. This preference for "open skies" operating regimes continues, with limitations, to this day.

World War II, like World War I, brought new life to the airline industry. Many airlines in the Allied countries were flush from lease contracts to the military, and foresaw a future explosive demand for civil air transport, for both passengers and cargo. They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the <a href="Boeing%20Stratocruiser">Boeing Stratocruiser</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Constellation">Lockheed Constellation</a>, and <a href="Douglas%20DC-6">Douglas DC-6</a>. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the <a href="B-29">B-29</a>, which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as <a href="pressurization">pressurization</a>. Most offered increased efficiency from both added speed and greater payload.

In the 1950s, the <a href="De%20Havilland%20Comet">De Havilland Comet</a>, <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>, <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a>, and <a href="Sud%20Aviation%20Caravelle">Sud Aviation Caravelle</a> became the first flagships of the Jet Age in the West, while the Eastern bloc had <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-104">Tupolev Tu-104</a> and <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-124">Tupolev Tu-124</a> in the fleets of state-owned carriers such as Czechoslovak <a href="Czech%20Airlines">ČSA</a>, Soviet <a href="Aeroflot">Aeroflot</a> and East-German <a href="Interflug">Interflug</a>. The <a href="Vickers%20Viscount">Vickers Viscount</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20L-188%20Electra">Lockheed L-188 Electra</a> inaugurated turboprop transport.

The next big boost for the airlines would come in the 1970s, when the <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747</a>, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>, and <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011">Lockheed L-1011</a> inaugurated <a href="widebody">widebody</a> ("jumbo jet") service, which is still the standard in international travel. The <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-144">Tupolev Tu-144</a> and its Western counterpart, <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a>, made supersonic travel a reality. Concorde first flew in 1969 and operated through 2003. In 1972, <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> began producing Europe's most commercially successful line of airliners to date. The added efficiencies for these aircraft were often not in speed, but in passenger capacity, payload, and range. Airbus also features modern electronic cockpits that were common across their aircraft to enable pilots to fly multiple models with minimal cross-training.

The 1978 U.S. <a href="Airline%20deregulation%20act">airline industry deregulation</a> lowered federally controlled barriers for new airlines just as a downturn in the nation's economy occurred. New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.

Major airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called <a href="loss%20leader">loss leader</a> pricing. In this strategy an already established and dominant airline stomps out its competition by lowering airfares on specific routes, below the cost of operating on it, choking out any chance a start-up airline may have. The industry side effect is an overall drop in revenue and service quality. Since deregulation in 1978 the average domestic ticket price has dropped by 40%. So has airline employee pay. By incurring massive losses, the airlines of the USA now rely upon a scourge of cyclical Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to continue doing business. <a href="America%20West%20Airlines">America West Airlines</a> (which has since merged with US Airways) remained a significant survivor from this new entrant era, as dozens, even hundreds, have gone under.

In many ways, the biggest winner in the deregulated environment was the air passenger. Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining <a href="frequent%20flyer">frequent flyer</a> loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity <a href="railroad">railroad</a> travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under <a href="nationalization">nationalization</a> through the continuing existence of <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>.

By the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.

Toward the end of the century, a new style of <a href="low-cost%20carrier">low cost airline</a> emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. <a href="Southwest%20Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a>, <a href="JetBlue">JetBlue</a>, <a href="AirTran%20Airways">AirTran Airways</a>, <a href="Skybus%20Airlines">Skybus Airlines</a> and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called "legacy airlines", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries. Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, <a href="ATA%20Airlines">ATA</a> and Skybus have since ceased operations.

Increasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and <a href="off%20spin">spun off</a> by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these <a href="holding%20company">holding companies</a> and <a href="parent%20company">parent companies</a> which are relatively well known, are the <a href="UAL%20Corporation">UAL Corporation</a>, along with the <a href="AMR%20Corporation">AMR Corporation</a>, among a long <a href="list%20of%20airline%20holding%20companies">list of airline holding companies</a> sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the <a href="private%20equity%20firm">private equity firm</a>s which often seize managerial, financial, and <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a> control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of <a href="Equity%20%28finance%29">capital</a> in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or <a href="liquidate">liquidating</a> an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.

Thus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. <a href="legacy%20carrier">legacy carrier</a> survived bankruptcy-free. Amongst the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, Robert Crandall has publicly stated:

"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake."

Congress passed the <a href="https%3A//www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926">Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act</a> (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11th terrorist attacks</a>. Through the <a href="Air%20Transportation%20Stabilization%20Board">ATSB</a> Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks. This resulted in the first government bailout of the 21st century. Between 2000 and 2005 US airlines lost $30 billion with wage cuts of over $15 billion and 100,000 employees laid off.

In recognition of the essential national economic role of a healthy aviation system, Congress authorized partial compensation of up to $5 billion in cash subject to review by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees subject to review by a newly created <a href="Air%20Transportation%20Stabilization%20Board">Air Transportation Stabilization Board</a> (ATSB). The applications to DOT for reimbursements were subjected to rigorous multi-year reviews not only by DOT program personnel but also by the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> and the DOT Inspector General.

Ultimately, the federal government provided $4.6 billion in one-time, subject-to-income-tax cash payments to 427 U.S. air carriers, with no provision for repayment, essentially a gift from the taxpayers. (Passenger carriers operating scheduled service received approximately $4 billion, subject to tax.) In addition, the ATSB approved loan guarantees to six airlines totaling approximately $1.6 billion. Data from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">U.S. Treasury Department</a> show that the government recouped the $1.6 billion and a profit of $339 million from the fees, interest and purchase of discounted airline stock associated with loan guarantees.

Although <a href="Philippine%20Airlines">Philippine Airlines</a> (PAL) was officially founded on February 26, 1941, its license to operate as an airliner was derived from merged Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) established by mining magnate Emmanuel N. Bachrach on December 3, 1930, making it Asia's oldest scheduled carrier still in operation. Commercial air service commenced three weeks later from <a href="Manila">Manila</a> to <a href="Baguio">Baguio</a>, making it Asia's first airline route. Bachrach's death in 1937 paved the way for its eventual merger with Philippine Airlines in March 1941 and made it Asia's oldest airline. It is also the oldest airline in Asia still operating under its current name. Bachrach's majority share in PATCO was bought by beer magnate Andres R. Soriano in 1939 upon the advice of General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> and later merged with newly formed Philippine Airlines with PAL as the surviving entity. Soriano has controlling interest in both airlines before the merger. PAL restarted service on March 15, 1941, with a single <a href="Beech%20Model%2018">Beech Model 18</a> NPC-54 aircraft, which started its daily services between <a href="Manila">Manila</a> (from <a href="Nielson%20Field">Nielson Field</a>) and <a href="Baguio">Baguio</a>, later to expand with larger aircraft such as the DC-3 and Vickers Viscount.
<a href="India">India</a> was also one of the first countries to embrace civil aviation. One of the first Asian airline companies was <a href="Air%20India">Air India</a>, which was founded as <a href="Tata%20Airlines">Tata Airlines</a> in 1932, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now <a href="Tata%20Group">Tata Group</a>). The airline was founded by India's leading industrialist, <a href="JRD%20Tata">JRD Tata</a>. On October 15, 1932, J. R. D. Tata himself flew a single engined <a href="De%20Havilland%20Puss%20Moth">De Havilland Puss Moth</a> carrying air mail (postal mail of <a href="Imperial%20Airways">Imperial Airways</a>) from <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> to <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> via <a href="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a>. The aircraft continued to <a href="Madras">Madras</a> via Bellary piloted by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> pilot <a href="Nevill%20Vintcent">Nevill Vintcent</a>. Tata Airlines was also one of the world's first major airlines which began its operations without any support from the Government.

With the outbreak of World War II, the airline presence in Asia came to a relative halt, with many new flag carriers donating their aircraft for military aid and other uses. Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946, under the name Air India. After the <a href="independence%20of%20India">independence of India</a>, 49% of the airline was acquired by the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a>. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name <a href="Air%20India%20International">Air India International</a>.

On July 31, 1946, a chartered Philippine Airlines (PAL) <a href="DC-4">DC-4</a> ferried 40 American servicemen to <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, from Nielson Airport in <a href="Makati%20City">Makati City</a> with stops in <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>, <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a> and <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, making PAL the first Asian airline to cross the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. A regular service between <a href="Manila">Manila</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> was started in December. It was during this year that the airline was designated as the flag carrier of Philippines.

During the era of <a href="decolonization">decolonization</a>, newly born Asian countries started to embrace air transport. Among the first Asian carriers during the era were <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> of <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> (founded in September 1946), <a href="Orient%20Airways">Orient Airways</a> (later <a href="Pakistan%20International%20Airlines">Pakistan International Airlines</a>; founded in October 1946), <a href="Air%20Ceylon">Air Ceylon</a> (later <a href="SriLankan%20Airlines">SriLankan Airlines</a>; founded in 1947), <a href="Malayan%20Airways%20Limited">Malayan Airways Limited</a> in 1947 (later <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore</a> and <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines">Malaysia Airlines</a>), <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in 1948, <a href="Garuda%20Indonesia">Garuda Indonesia</a> in 1949, <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> in 1951, <a href="Thai%20Airways%20International">Thai Airways International</a> in 1960, and <a href="Korean%20National%20Airlines">Korean National Airlines</a> in 1947.

Among the first countries to have regular airlines in Latin America were <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> with <a href="Lloyd%20A%C3%A9reo%20Boliviano">Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> with <a href="Cubana%20de%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Cubana de Aviación</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> with <a href="Avianca">Avianca</a> (the first airline established in the Americas), Argentina with <a href="Aerolineas%20Argentinas">Aerolineas Argentinas</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a> with <a href="LAN%20Chile">LAN Chile</a> (today <a href="LATAM%20Airlines">LATAM Airlines</a>), <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> with <a href="Varig">Varig</a>, <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> with <a href="Dominicana%20de%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Dominicana de Aviación</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> with <a href="Mexicana%20de%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Mexicana de Aviación</a>, <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> with <a href="BWIA%20West%20Indies%20Airways">BWIA West Indies Airways</a> (today <a href="Caribbean%20Airlines">Caribbean Airlines</a>), <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> with <a href="Aeropostal">Aeropostal</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> with <a href="Aerovias%20nacionales%20de%20puerto%20rico">Puertorriquena</a>; and <a href="Grupo%20TACA">TACA</a> based in <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> and representing several airlines of <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> (<a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>). All the previous airlines started regular operations well before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Puerto Rican commercial airlines such as <a href="Prinair">Prinair</a>, <a href="Oceanair">Oceanair</a>, <a href="Fina%20Air">Fina Air</a> and <a href="Vieques%20Air%20Link">Vieques Air Link</a> came much after the second world war, as did several others from other countries like Mexico's <a href="Interjet">Interjet</a> and <a href="Volaris">Volaris</a>, Venezuela's <a href="Aserca%20Airlines">Aserca Airlines</a> and others.

The air travel market has evolved rapidly over recent years in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>. Some industry estimates indicate that over 2,000 new aircraft will begin service over the next five years in this region.

These airlines serve domestic flights within their countries, as well as connections within Latin America and also overseas flights to North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

Only two airlines: <a href="Avianca">Avianca</a> and <a href="LATAM%20Airlines">LATAM Airlines</a> have international subsidiaries and cover many destinations within the Americas as well as major hubs in other continents. LATAM with <a href="Chile">Chile</a> as the central operation along with <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and formerly with some operations in the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. The <a href="AviancaTaca%20Holding">AviancaTACA</a> group has control of <a href="Avianca%20Brazil">Avianca Brazil</a>, <a href="VIP%20Ecuador">VIP Ecuador</a> and a strategic alliance with <a href="AeroGal">AeroGal</a>.

Many countries have <a href="Flag%20carrier">national airline</a>s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.

The United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have "deregulated" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.

The entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.

As a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.

In the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.

Groups such as the <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> establish worldwide standards for safety and other vital concerns. Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the <a href="Bermuda%20Agreement">Bermuda Agreement</a> between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.

Bilateral agreements are based on the "<a href="freedoms%20of%20the%20air">freedoms of the air</a>", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as <a href="cabotage">cabotage</a>). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.

In the 1990s, "<a href="open%20skies">open skies</a>" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of <a href="cabotage">cabotage</a> restrictions.

Historically, air travel has survived largely through state support, whether in the form of equity or subsidies. The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.

One argument is that <a href="positive%20externalities">positive externalities</a>, such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as <a href="highway">highway</a>s and <a href="Rail%20transport">railways</a>, both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.

In July 2016, the total airline capacity was 181.1 billion <a href="Available%20Seat%20Kilometers">Available Seat Kilometers</a> (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.

The <a href="world%27s%20largest%20airlines">world's largest airlines</a> can be defined in several ways. <a href="American%20Airlines%20Group">American Airlines Group</a> is the largest by its fleet size, <a href="revenue">revenue</a>, <a href="profit%20%28accounting%29">profit</a>, <a href="passenger">passenger</a>s carried and <a href="revenue%20passenger%20mile">revenue passenger mile</a>. <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> is the largest by <a href="asset">asset</a>s value and <a href="market%20capitalization">market capitalization</a>. <a href="Lufthansa%20Group">Lufthansa Group</a> is the largest by number of <a href="employee">employee</a>s, <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> by freight <a href="tonne-kilometer">tonne-kilometer</a>s, <a href="Ryanair">Ryanair</a> by number of international passengers carried and <a href="Turkish%20Airlines">Turkish Airlines</a> by number of countries served.

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized <a href="yield%20management">yield management</a> systems.

Because of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.

Most airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of <a href="price%20discrimination">price discrimination</a>, to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of <a href="travel%20class">travel class</a>es for pricing purposes.

A complicating factor is that of origin-destination control ("O&D control"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.
The advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably <a href="Sabre%20%28computer%20system%29">Sabre</a>, allowed airlines to easily perform <a href="cost-benefit%20analysis">cost-benefit analyses</a> on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).

The intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term "<a href="fare%20war">fare war</a>" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the <a href="Airline%20Tariff%20Publishing%20Company">Airline Tariff Publishing Company</a> (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to <a href="Computer%20Reservation%20System">Computer Reservation System</a>s across the world.

The extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in "legacy" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.

Computers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for "no-shows", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with <a href="overbooking">overbooking</a> on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.

Full-service airlines have a high level of fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel, airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services, sales distribution, catering, training, <a href="aviation%20insurance">aviation insurance</a> and other costs. Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.

Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.

Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2-3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10-13%, handling companies 11-14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)

The widespread entrance of a new breed of low cost airlines beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate Southwest Airlines in various respects, and like Southwest, they can eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.

As a result, a <a href="shakeout">shakeout</a> of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> (twice), <a href="US%20Airways">US Airways</a> (twice), <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, and <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a> have all declared <a href="Chapter%2011">Chapter 11</a> bankruptcy. Some argue that it would be far better for the industry as a whole if a wave of actual closures were to reduce the number of "undead" airlines competing with healthy airlines while being artificially protected from creditors via <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> law. On the other hand, some have pointed out that the reduction in capacity would be short lived given that there would be large quantities of relatively new aircraft that bankruptcies would want to get rid of and would re-enter the market either as increased fleets for the survivors or the basis of cheap planes for new startups.

Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.

Airline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain. Compare Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> and derivatives), with the now defunct <a href="Eastern%20Air%20Lines">Eastern Air Lines</a> which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.

A second financial issue is that of <a href="Hedge%20%28finance%29">hedging</a> <a href="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="fuel">fuel</a> purchases, which are usually second only to <a href="Labour%20%28economics%29">labor</a> in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft. While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000–2005 period.

In view of the congestion apparent at many international <a href="airport">airport</a>s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.

If a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, <a href="Reagan%20National%20Airport">Reagan National Airport</a> attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to <a href="Baltimore-Washington%20International%20Airport">Baltimore-Washington International Airport</a> and <a href="Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles International Airport</a>.

Other factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia Airport</a> is the preferred airport for most of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a>'s longer runways.

<a href="Codeshare%20agreement">Codesharing</a> is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>–<a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the <a href="Austrian%20Airlines">Austrian</a>–<a href="Sabena">Sabena</a> partnership on the <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>–<a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>–<a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> with Austrian <a href="Aircraft%20livery">livery</a>.

Since airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as "show me flights from Chicago to Düsseldorf"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago–<a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to Düsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.

A more recent development is the <a href="airline%20alliance">airline alliance</a>, which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as <a href="Star%20Alliance">Star Alliance</a>, <a href="Oneworld">Oneworld</a>, and <a href="SkyTeam">SkyTeam</a> coordinate their passenger service programs (such as <a href="Airport%20lounge">lounges</a> and <a href="frequent-flyer%20program">frequent-flyer program</a>s), offer special <a href="Interlining">interline</a> tickets, and often engage in extensive <a href="Codeshare%20agreement">codesharing</a> (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations—sometimes including cross-equity arrangements—in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was <a href="KLM">KLM</a>, who partnered with <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a>. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the <a href="Air%20France-KLM">fusion of KLM and Air France</a> in 2004.

Often the companies combine <a href="Information%20technology">IT</a> operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.

Fuel hedging is a <a href="contractual">contractual</a> tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.

Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy. Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel costs.

Airlines often have a strong <a href="seasonality">seasonality</a>, with traffic low in <a href="Winter">Winter</a> and peaking in <a href="Summer">Summer</a>. In Europe the most extreme market are the <a href="Greek%20islands">Greek islands</a> with July/August having more than ten times the winter traffic, as <a href="Jet2">Jet2</a> is the most seasonal among <a href="Low%20cost%20carriers">Low cost carriers</a> with July having seven times the January traffic, whereas <a href="legacy%20carriers">legacy carriers</a> are much less with only 85/115% variability.

Aircraft engines emit <a href="noise%20pollution">noise pollution</a>, gases and particulate emissions, and contribute to <a href="global%20dimming">global dimming</a>.

Growth of the industry in recent years raised a number of ecological questions.

Domestic air transport grew in China at 15.5 percent annually from 2001 to 2006. The rate of air travel globally increased at 3.7 percent per year over the same time. In the EU <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> emissions from aviation increased by 87% between 1990 and 2006. However it must be compared with the flights increase, only in UK, between 1990 and 2006 terminal passengers increased from 100 000 thousands to 250 000 thousands., according to AEA reports every year, 750 million passengers travel by European airlines, which also share 40% of merchandise value in and out of Europe. Without even pressure from "green activists", targeting lower ticket prices, generally, airlines do what is possible to cut the fuel consumption (and gas emissions connected therewith). Further, according to some reports, it can be concluded that the last piston-powered aircraft were as fuel-efficient as the average jet in 2005.

Despite continuing efficiency improvements from the major aircraft manufacturers, the expanding demand for global air travel has resulted in growing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Currently, the aviation sector, including US domestic and global international travel, make approximately 1.6 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions per annum. North America accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world's GHG emissions from aviation fuel use.

CO2 emissions from the <a href="jet%20fuel">jet fuel</a> burned per passenger on an average airline flight is about 353 kilograms (776 pounds). Loss of natural habitat potential associated with the jet fuel burned per passenger on a airline flight is estimated to be 250 square meters (2700 square feet).

In the context of climate change and <a href="peak%20oil">peak oil</a>, there is a debate about possible <a href="taxation">taxation</a> of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an <a href="emissions%20trading">emissions trading</a> scheme, with a view to ensuring that the total <a href="external%20costs">external costs</a> of aviation are taken into account.

The airline industry is responsible for about 11 percent of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> estimates that <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution would be blending algae fuels with existing jet fuel:


There are projects on <a href="electric%20aircraft">electric aircraft</a>, and some of them are fully operational as of 2013.

Each operator of a scheduled or charter flight uses an <a href="Airline%20codes">airline call sign</a> when communicating with airports or air traffic control centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a "Speedbird" call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">BOAC</a>, while <a href="SkyEurope">SkyEurope</a> used "Relax".

The various types of airline personnel include:
Flight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.
Airlines follow a <a href="corporation">corporate</a> structure where each broad area of operations (such as maintenance, flight operations (including flight safety), and passenger service) is supervised by a vice president. Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ <a href="lawyers">lawyers</a> to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.

The pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions. 

Growth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="India">India</a> and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2-3% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> in 1999 said "the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero." He believes it is one of the hardest businesses to manage. 

As in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, <a href="Mergers%20and%20acquisitions">mergers</a>, or <a href="takeover">takeover</a>s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.

Australian Democrats

The Australian Democrats is an <a href="list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Australia%23Other%20parties">Australian political party</a> in existence since 1977. It was Australia's largest <a href="minor%20party">minor party</a> from its formation through to the early 2000s, and frequently held the <a href="balance%20of%20power%20%28parliament%29">balance of power</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> during that time.

The party was formed as a merger of the <a href="Australia%20Party">Australia Party</a> and the <a href="New%20Liberal%20Movement">New Liberal Movement</a>, both of which were descended from <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> splinter groups. The party's inaugural leader was <a href="Don%20Chipp">Don Chipp</a>, a former Liberal cabinet minister, who famously promised to "keep the bastards honest". At the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201977">1977 federal election</a>, the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">lower house</a>. Its share of the vote collapsed at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202004">2004 election</a> and was further diminished <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">in 2007</a>; the party has not mounted a serious nationwide campaign since then, and its last senators left office in 2008. From time to time, Democrats were also elected to the parliaments of four states and the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>.

Due to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a>'s <a href="Goods%20and%20services%20tax%20%28Australia%29">goods and services tax</a> (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as <a href="Centrism">centrists</a>, occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The party had no single base, instead drawing on the support of a sometimes uneasy coalition of political moderates, disaffected major-party voters, civil libertarians, and social activists (including environmentalists and anti-war campaigners). Commonalities included an almost uniform <a href="social%20liberalism">social liberalism</a> and an emphasis on <a href="participatory%20democracy">participatory democracy</a>. Within the parliamentary party there was frequent internal conflict, with several senators leaving the party at various stages to sit as independents or to join other parties. After Don Chipp's retirement in 1986, only one subsequent leader (<a href="Cheryl%20Kernot">Cheryl Kernot</a>) served for more than four years.

The party was founded on principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> through postal ballots of all members, so that "there should be no <a href="hierarchical">hierarchical</a> structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members." From the outset, members' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party <a href="ombudsman">ombudsman</a> and membership ballot.

Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a>, opposition to the primacy of <a href="economic%20rationalism">economic rationalism</a> (Australian <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.

The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of <a href="green%20politics">green politics</a> at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the "cause célèbre" of the <a href="Franklin%20Dam%23Inquiry%2C%20referendum%20and%20election">Franklin River Dam</a>.

The party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">conservative</a> affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left. This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming "the electoral objective" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.

Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">ACT</a>, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> seats in all six states. However, at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202004">2004</a> and <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007</a> federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost. The last remaining State parliamentarian, <a href="David%20Winderlich">David Winderlich</a>, left the party and was defeated as an independent in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202010%23Upper%20house">2010</a>.

On the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a Centre-Line Party, which Chipp was invited to lead—but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. The Centre-Line Party was the provisional title of the Australian Democrats party. The occasion was a meeting at the <a href="Perth%20Town%20Hall">Perth Town Hall</a> to which Don Chipp had been invited in the hope that he would accept the position of leader of the new party, which would be an amalgamation of the <a href="Australia%20Party">Australia Party</a> and the <a href="New%20LM">New Liberal Movement</a>. On that occasion, Chipp declined to commit himself but did so at a corresponding public meeting in Melbourne on 9 May 1977. Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister <a href="John%20Gorton">John Gorton</a>, and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee. The new party was eventually renamed the Australian Democrats by a ballot of its membership. "Fifty-six suggestions produced by members were listed on the ballot paper, including Uniting Australia Party, Australian Centre Line Party, Dinkum Democrats, Practical Idealists of Australia and People for Sanity Party!! After the ballot, the suggestion of the Steering Committee, 'Australian Democrats', was overwhelmingly accepted." The name "Australian Democrats" was already in informal currency before this decision.

The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator <a href="Janine%20Haines">Janine Haines</a> who filled <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a>'s casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201977">1977 federal elections</a> after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201969">1969</a> and the <a href="Liberal%20Movement%20%28Australia%29">Liberal Movement</a>, in <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201974">1974</a> and <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">1975</a>. The party's broad aim was to achieve a <a href="balance%20of%20power%20%28parliament%29">balance of power</a> in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.

The grassroot support attracted by Chipp's leadership was measurable at the party's first electoral test at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201977">1977 federal election</a> on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required <a href="Droop%20quota">quota</a> was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and <a href="Colin%20Mason">Colin Mason</a> (NSW).

The Australian Democrats' first national conference, on 16–17 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, who said: I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party. 

At a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201980">1980 election campaign</a>, Chipp described his party's aim as to "keep the bastards honest"—the "bastards" being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.

At the October 1980 election, the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing Janine Haines (SA) and two new senators <a href="Michael%20Macklin">Michael Macklin</a> (Qld) and <a href="John%20Siddons">John Siddons</a> (Vic), bringing the party's strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .

A by-election in the South Australian state seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Mitcham%20%28South%20Australia%29">Mitcham</a> (now <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Waite">Waite</a>) saw <a href="Heather%20Southcott">Heather Southcott</a> <a href="Mitcham%20state%20by-election%2C%201982">retain the seat</a> for the Democrats in 1982. Since 1955 it had been held by conservative lawyer <a href="Robin%20Millhouse">Robin Millhouse</a> whose <a href="New%20LM">New Liberal Movement</a> merged into the Democrats in 1977, and who was resigning to take up a senior judicial appointment. Southcott was defeated later that year at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201982">1982 state election</a>. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.

Don Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as party leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator for Victoria by <a href="Janet%20Powell">Janet Powell</a>.

At the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201987">1987 election</a> following a <a href="double%20dissolution">double dissolution</a>, the reduced <a href="Australian%20Senate%23Voting%20system">quota</a> of 7.7% necessary to win a seat assisted the election of three new senators. 6-year terms were won by <a href="Paul%20McLean%20%28politician%29">Paul McLean</a> (NSW) and incumbents Janine Haines (South Australia) and Janet Powell (Victoria). In South Australia, a second senator, <a href="John%20Coulter%20%28politician%29">John Coulter</a>, was elected for a 3-year term, as were incumbent Michael Macklin (Queensland) and <a href="Jean%20Jenkins%20%28politician%29">Jean Jenkins</a> (Western Australia).

1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Kingston">Kingston</a>.

The casual vacancy was filled by <a href="Meg%20Lees">Meg Lees</a> several months before the election of <a href="Cheryl%20Kernot">Cheryl Kernot</a> in place of retired deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the party's national parliamentary deputy leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions. In the event, Victorian <a href="Janet%20Powell">Janet Powell</a> was elected as leader and <a href="John%20Coulter%20%28politician%29">John Coulter</a> was chosen as deputy leader.

Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic <a href="recession">recession</a> was building, and events such as the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas.
The Australian Democrats had a long-standing policy to oppose war and so opposed Australia's support of, and participation in, the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia's participation, the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate.

Because of the party's <a href="Pacifism">pacifist</a>-based opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party's standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative <a href="News%20leak">media 'leaks'</a> concerning her openly established relationship with <a href="Sid%20Spindler">Sid Spindler</a> and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy <a href="John%20Coulter%20%28politician%29">John Coulter</a>. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip <a href="Paul%20McLean%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Paul McLean</a> who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by <a href="Karin%20Sowada">Karin Sowada</a>. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.

Because of their numbers on the cross benches during the <a href="Hawke%20Government">Hawke</a> and <a href="Keating%20Government">Keating</a> governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a <a href="Balance%20of%20power%20%28Parliament%29">balance of power</a>—which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices. The party's parliamentary influence was weakened in 1996 after the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a> was elected, and a Labor senator, <a href="Mal%20Colston">Mal Colston</a>, resigned from the Labor Party. Since the Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators, the Coalition government was able on occasion to pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and <a href="Brian%20Harradine">Brian Harradine</a>. Following <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201998">the 1998 election</a> the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202004">the 2004 election</a>.

The party's integrity as a neutral <a href="Third%20party%20%28politics%29">third party</a> suffered a serious blow from the resignation and defection of leader Cheryl Kernot in October 1997, with revelations of her sexual relationship with <a href="Gareth%20Evans%20%28politician%29">Gareth Evans</a> and her aspirations to a ministerial position in a Labor government.

Under Lees' leadership, in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201998">1998 federal election</a>, the Democrats' candidate <a href="John%20Schumann">John Schumann</a> came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister <a href="Alexander%20Downer">Alexander Downer</a>'s seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Mayo">Mayo</a> in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's <a href="Ranked%20voting%20systems">preferential voting</a> system. The party's representation increased to nine senators.

Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party's support for the Government's <a href="Goods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Australia%29">Goods and Services Tax</a> (GST), was damaging to the Democrats. Opposed by the Labor Party, the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Australian Greens</a> and independent Senator Harradine, the GST required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package nor the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan "No GST on food".

In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister <a href="John%20Howard">Howard</a>, Meg Lees, <a href="Andrew%20Murray%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Andrew Murray</a> and the party room Senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions. Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour. However, two dissident senators on the party's left <a href="Natasha%20Stott%20Despoja">Natasha Stott Despoja</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a> voted against the GST.

In 2001, a leadership spill saw Meg Lees replaced as leader by Natasha Stott Despoja after a very public and bitter leadership battle. Despite criticism of Stott Despoja's youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election. Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of <a href="Vicki%20Bourne">Vicki Bourne</a>'s Senate seat in NSW.

The <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202002">2002 South Australian state election</a> was the last time an Australian Democrat would be elected to an Australian parliament. <a href="Sandra%20Kanck">Sandra Kanck</a> was re-elected to a second eight-year term from an upper house primary vote of 7.3 percent.

Resulting tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to Meg Lees leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the <a href="Australian%20Progressive%20Alliance">Australian Progressive Alliance</a>. Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues. It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a> as leader. While the public fighting stopped, the public support for the party remained at record lows.

On 6 December 2003, Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he swore at <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> Senator <a href="Jeannie%20Ferris">Jeannie Ferris</a> on the floor of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament</a> while intoxicated. The party issued a statement stating that deputy leader <a href="Lyn%20Allison">Lyn Allison</a> would serve as the acting leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.

Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202004">2004 federal election</a> in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> in South Australia, where they received between 7 and 31 per cent of the Lower House vote in 2001, and between 1 and 4 per cent in 2004. Three incumbent senators were defeated—<a href="Aden%20Ridgeway">Aden Ridgeway</a> (NSW), <a href="Brian%20Greig">Brian Greig</a> (WA) and <a href="John%20Cherry%20%28Australian%20politician%29">John Cherry</a> (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Lyn Allison as leader and <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a> as her deputy.

From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980.

On 5 January 2006, the ABC reported that the <a href="Tasmanian%20Electoral%20Commission">Tasmanian Electoral Commission</a> had de-registered that division of the party for failing to provide a list containing the required number of members to be registered for Tasmanian state and local elections.

On 18 March 2006, at the <a href="South%20Australian%20legislative%20election%2C%202006">2006 South Australian state election</a>, the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, <a href="Kate%20Reynolds">Kate Reynolds</a>, was defeated.

After the election, South Australian senator Natasha Stott Despoja denied rumours that she was considering quitting the party.

In early July, Richard Pascoe, national and <a href="South%20Australian">South Australian</a> party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader <a href="Sandra%20Kanck">Sandra Kanck</a>'s comments regarding the drug <a href="MDMA">MDMA</a> which he saw as damaging to the party.

On 5 July 2006, Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia Andrew Murray announced his intention not to contest the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 federal election</a>, citing frustration arising from the Howard Government's control of both houses and his unwillingness to serve another six-year term. His term ended on 30 June 2008.

On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: "... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats. "

On 22 October 2006, Australian Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja announced her intention not to seek re-election at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 federal election</a> due to health concerns. Her term ended on 30 June 2008.

In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%, less than half of the party's result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).

In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, <a href="Arthur%20Chesterfield-Evans">Arthur Chesterfield-Evans</a>. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. A higher vote was achieved in some of the Legislative Assembly seats selectively contested as compared to 2003. However, the statewide vote share fell because the party was unable to field as many candidates as in 2003.

In the Victorian state by-election in Albert Park District the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled 5.75 per cent of the primary vote, despite a large number of candidates, and all media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates.

On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.

The Democrats had no success at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 federal election</a>. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and <a href="Andrew%20Bartlett">Andrew Bartlett</a> (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), did not run for new terms. All four senators' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977. An ABC report noted that "on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website the party is now referred to just as 'other'".

The last of the party's state upper-house members, <a href="David%20Winderlich">David Winderlich</a>, resigned from the party in October 2009 and was defeated as an independent at the <a href="Full%20results%20of%20the%20South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202010">2010 election</a>.

In March 2012, the <a href="Australian%20Electoral%20Commission">Australian Electoral Commission</a> queried a Democrats submission of 550 names of purported members and proposed deregistering the party for having fewer than 500 members, the threshold needed for registration. The Commission later satisfied itself that the party had sufficient membership to continue its registration.

The Democrats did not nominate a single candidate in the <a href="Candidates%20of%20the%20South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202014">2014 South Australian election</a>, in the party's state of origin.

On 16 April 2015, the Australian Electoral Commission deregistered the Australian Democrats as a political party for failure to demonstrate the requisite 500 members to maintain registration.

The Australian Democrats have said they will appeal the AEC decision, which under the legislation is reviewable. However the party does not appear on the AEC Current Register of Political Parties and could not contest the 2016 Federal Election. Much of their support in the party's birthplace, South Australia, flowed to the <a href="Nick%20Xenophon%20Team">Nick Xenophon Team</a>, which has a very similar platform.

The party's original support base consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial conflict between the two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people with a desire to participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for <a href="environmental%20protection">environmental protection</a> and <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly <a href="neo-Keynesian%20economics">neo-Keynesian economics</a> and a progressive environmental platform.

The original agenda included <a href="economic%20interventionism">interventionist economic</a> policies, commitment to <a href="environmentalism">environmental</a> causes, support for <a href="wiktionary%3Areconciliation">reconciliation</a> with Australia's <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous population</a> through such mechanisms as formal treaties, <a href="pacifism">pacifist</a> approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised <a href="tertiary%20education">tertiary-educated</a> and <a href="middle%20class">middle-class</a> constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammeled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.

The party has a platform of <a href="participatory%20democracy">participatory democracy</a>, with policies supporting <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> and <a href="citizen%20initiated%20referendum">citizen-initiated referenda</a>. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.

However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party's journals, obtainable in major public libraries.

In a 2009 "rebuild" process, the party announced creation of a new policy process, attempts to improve internal communication, and envisaged development of a new party constitution.

Prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202013">2013 federal election</a>, the party, though factionally divided into two separate organisations, was able to publish a comprehensive package of member-balloted policies.

Support for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 per cent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense <a href="Central%20Business%20District">CBD and inner-suburban neighbourhoods</a> of the <a href="Australian%20capital%20cities">capital cities</a> (especially <a href="Adelaide%2C%20Australia">Adelaide</a>). Therefore, they never managed to win a <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments.

Following the internal conflict over <a href="Goods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Australia%29">GST</a> (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Australian Greens</a> who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial <a href="third%20party%20%28politics%29">third party</a>. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al. Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback in the federal arena.

Following <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>'s displacement of <a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a> as federal leader of the Liberal Party in 2009, the Democrats sought to attract the support of "those Liberals who no longer feel they can support their party".

Australian Capital Territory

The Australian Capital Territory (ACT; known as the Federal Capital Territory until 1938) is Australia's <a href="federal%20district">federal district</a>, located in the south-east of the country and <a href="enclave%20and%20exclave">enclaved</a> within the state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. It contains <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, the capital city of Australia.

Geographically, the territory is bounded by the <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a>-<a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a> railway line in the east, the <a href="Drainage%20divide">watershed</a> of <a href="Naas%20%28valley%29">Naas Creek</a> in the south, the watershed of the <a href="Cotter%20River">Cotter River</a> in the west, and the watershed of the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a> in the north-east. The ACT also has <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">a small strip of territory</a> around the southern end of the <a href="Beecroft%20Peninsula">Beecroft Peninsula</a>, which is the northern headland of <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>.

The need for a national territory was flagged by colonial delegates during the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> conventions of the late 19th century. Section 125 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Australian Constitution</a> provided that, following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Federal Government</a>. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by the state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in 1911, two years prior to the naming of Canberra as the national capital in 1913. The <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20floral%20emblems">floral emblem</a> of the ACT is the <a href="Wahlenbergia%20gloriosa">royal bluebell</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20bird%20emblems">bird emblem</a> is the <a href="gang-gang%20cockatoo">gang-gang cockatoo</a>.

The economic activity of the Australian Capital Territory is heavily concentrated around Canberra. A stable housing market, steady employment and rapid population growth in the 21st century have led to economic prosperity and in 2011 <a href="Commsec">CommSec</a> ranked the ACT as the second best performing economic region in the country. This trend continued into 2016, when the territory was ranked the third best performing out of all of Australia's states and territories. There is a higher proportion of young adults in the region compared with other Australian states or territories. Approximately one-fifth of ACT residents were born outside of Australia, mainly in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Almost one-fifth speak a language other than English at home, the most common being <a href="Chinese%20Australian">Chinese</a>.

The ACT is bounded by the <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a>-<a href="Cooma%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cooma</a> railway line in the east, the <a href="Drainage%20divide">watershed</a> of <a href="Naas%20%28valley%29">Naas Creek</a> in the south, the watershed of the <a href="Cotter%20River">Cotter River</a> in the west, and the watershed of the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a> in the north-east. The ACT also has a small strip of territory around the southern end of the <a href="Beecroft%20Peninsula">Beecroft Peninsula</a>, which is the northern headland of Jervis Bay.

Apart from the city of Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land (<a href="domestic%20sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="dairy%20cattle">dairy cattle</a>, <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park (<a href="Namadgi%20National%20Park">Namadgi National Park</a>), much of it mountainous and forested. Small townships and communities located within the ACT include <a href="Williamsdale%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Williamsdale</a>, <a href="Naas%20%28valley%29">Naas</a>, <a href="Uriarra%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Uriarra</a>, <a href="Tharwa%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Tharwa</a> and <a href="Hall%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Hall</a>.

Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the <a href="Tidbinbilla%20Nature%20Reserve">Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve</a> and the <a href="Canberra%20Deep%20Space%20Communication%20Complex">Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex</a>, operated by the United States' <a href="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) as part of its <a href="Deep%20Space%20Network">Deep Space Network</a>.

There are a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks in the Namadgi National Park. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

Because of its elevation and distance from the coast, the Australian Capital Territory experiences four distinct seasons, unlike many other Australian cities whose climates are moderated by the sea. Canberra is noted for its warm to hot, dry summers, and cold winters with occasional <a href="fog">fog</a> and frequent <a href="frost">frost</a>s. Many of the higher mountains in the territory's south-west are snow-covered for at least part of the winter. <a href="Thunderstorm">Thunderstorm</a>s can occur between October and March, and annual rainfall is , with rainfall highest in spring and summer and lowest in winter.

The highest maximum temperature recorded in the ACT was at <a href="Acton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Acton</a> on 11 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was at <a href="Gudgenby%20River">Gudgenby</a> on 11 July 1971.

Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the "Canberra Formation", the "Pittman Formation", "Black Mountain Sandstone" and "State Circle Shale".

In the 1840s <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s and <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s from the <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near <a href="Duntroon%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duntroon</a>. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed. Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the "Black Mountain Sandstone" formation and the "Pittman Formation" consisting largely of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>-rich <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> and <a href="shale">shale</a>. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major <a href="orogeny">volcanic activity</a> in the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> forming much of the east coast of Australia.

The ACT has internal self-government, but <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Australia's Constitution</a> does not afford the territory government the full legislative independence provided to Australian states. Laws are made in a 25-member <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> that combines both state and local government functions (prior to 2016, the Assembly was made up of 17 members).

Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected via the <a href="Single%20transferable%20vote">Hare Clarke</a> system. The ACT Chief Minister (currently <a href="Andrew%20Barr">Andrew Barr</a>, <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>) is elected by members of the ACT Assembly. The ACT Government Chief Minister is a member of the <a href="Council%20of%20Australian%20Governments">Council of Australian Governments</a>.

Unlike other self-governing Australian territories (for example, the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>), the ACT does not have an Administrator. The Crown is represented by the Australian <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> in the government of the ACT. Until 4 December 2011, the decisions of the assembly could be overruled by the Governor-General (effectively by the national government) under section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, although the federal parliament voted in 2011 to abolish this veto power, instead requiring a majority of both houses of the federal parliament to override an enactment of the ACT. The Chief Minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly.

In Australia's <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a>, the ACT is represented by four federal members: two members of the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> represent the <a href="Division%20of%20Fenner">Division of Fenner</a> and the <a href="Division%20of%20Canberra">Division of Canberra</a> and it is one of only two territories to be represented in the Senate, with two <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senators</a> (the other being the Northern Territory). The Member for Fenner and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a>.

In 1915 the "<a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory%20Acceptance%20Act%201915">Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915</a>" created the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a> as an annexe to the Australian Capital Territory. In 1988, when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay became a separate territory administered by the Australian Government Minister responsible for Territories, presently the <a href="Minister%20for%20Home%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Home Affairs</a>.

The ACT retains a small area of territory on the coast on the <a href="Beecroft%20Peninsula">Beecroft Peninsula</a>, consisting of a strip of coastline around the northern headland of Jervis Bay (not to be confused with the Jervis Bay Territory, which is on the southern headland of the Bay). The ACT's land on the Beecroft Peninsula is an "<a href="exclave">exclave</a>", that is, an area of territory not physically connected to the main part of the ACT. Interestingly, this ACT exclave surrounds a small exclave of NSW territory, namely the <a href="Point%20Perpendicular">Point Perpendicular</a> lighthouse which is at the southern tip of the Beecroft Peninsula. The lighthouse and its grounds are New South Wales territory, but cut off from the rest of the state by the strip of ACT land. This is a geographic curiosity: an exclave of NSW land enclosed by an exclave of ACT land.

ACT Ministers implement their executive powers through the following government directorates:

At the , the population of the ACT was 397,397 of whom most lived in Canberra. The ACT median weekly income for people aged over 15 was $1000 while the national average was $662. The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is higher than the national average. Within the ACT 4.5% of the population have a postgraduate degree compared to 1.8% across the whole of Australia.

Canberra is a <a href="New%20town">planned city</a> that was originally designed by <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Walter Burley Griffin</a>, a major 20th century American architect. Major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid. The city centre is laid out on two perpendicular axes: a water axis stretching along <a href="Lake%20Burley%20Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>, and a ceremonial land axis stretching from Parliament House on <a href="Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Capital Hill</a> north-eastward along <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade</a> to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> at the foot of <a href="Mount%20Ainslie">Mount Ainslie</a>.

The area known as the <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle%2C%20Canberra">Parliamentary Triangle</a> is formed by three of Burley Griffin's axes, stretching from Capital Hill along <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Commonwealth Avenue</a> to the Civic Centre around City Hill, along Constitution Avenue to the Defence precinct on Russell Hill, and along Kings Avenue back to Capital Hill.

The larger scheme of Canberra's layout is based on the three peaks surrounding the city, Mount Ainslie, <a href="Black%20Mountain%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29">Black Mountain</a>, and <a href="Red%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Red Hill</a>. The main symmetrical axis of the city is along <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade</a> and roughly on the line between Mount Ainslie and <a href="Bimberi%20Peak">Bimberi Peak</a>. Bimberi Peak being the highest mountain in the ACT approximately south west of Canberra . The precise alignment of Anzac parade is between Mount Ainslie and <a href="Capital%20Hill%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Capital Hill</a> (formally Kurrajong Hill).

The <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Griffins</a> assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary color which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition. In fact, WWI interrupted the construction and some conflicts after the war made it a difficult process for the Griffins. Nevertheless, Canberra stands halfway between the ski slopes and the beach. It enjoys a natural cooling from geophysical factors.

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts (with an eighth currently under construction), each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:

The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs. In 1967 the then <a href="National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission">National Capital Development Commission</a> adopted the "Y Plan" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y, with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.

Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through the town planning process, but also through the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. All land in the ACT is held on 99 year leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.

Most suburbs have their own local shops, and are located close to a larger shopping centre serving a group of suburbs. Community facilities and schools are often also located near local shops or group shopping centres. Many of Canberra's <a href="List%20of%20Canberra%20suburbs">suburbs</a> are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> words for their title.

<a href="Street%20name">Street name</a>s typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of <a href="Duffy%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duffy</a> are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of <a href="Dunlop%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Dunlop</a> are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of <a href="Page%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Page</a> are named after biologists and naturalists. Most <a href="diplomatic%20mission">diplomatic mission</a>s are located in the suburbs of <a href="Yarralumla%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Yarralumla</a>, <a href="Deakin%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Deakin</a> and <a href="O%27Malley%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">O'Malley</a>. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of <a href="Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Fyshwick</a>, <a href="Mitchell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Mitchell</a> and <a href="Hume%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Hume</a>.

Almost all educational institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are located within <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. The ACT public education system schooling is normally split up into <a href="Pre-School">Pre-School</a>, Primary School (K-6), High School (7–10) and <a href="College%23Australia">College</a> (11–12) followed by studies at university or CIT (Canberra Institute of Technology). Many private high schools include years 11 and 12 and are referred to as colleges. Children are required to attend school until they turn 17 under the ACT Government's "Learn or Earn" policy.

In February 2004 there were 140 <a href="List%20of%20schools%20in%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">public and non-governmental schools</a> in Canberra; 96 were operated by the Government and 44 are non-Government. In 2005 there were 60,275 students in the ACT school system. 59.3% of the students were enrolled in government schools with the remaining 40.7% in non-government schools. There were 30,995 students in primary school, 19,211 in high school, 9,429 in college and a further 340 in special schools.

As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15–64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>, significantly higher than the national average of 19%. The two main tertiary institutions are the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> (ANU) in <a href="Acton%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Acton</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Canberra">University of Canberra</a> (UC) in <a href="Bruce%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Bruce</a>. There are also two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou is a campus of the <a href="Australian%20Catholic%20University">Australian Catholic University</a> and St Mark's Theological College is a campus of <a href="Charles%20Sturt%20University">Charles Sturt University</a>. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus <a href="Canberra%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Canberra Institute of Technology</a>.

Unit of alcohol

Units of alcohol are used in the United Kingdom (UK) as a measure to quantify the actual alcoholic content within a given volume of an <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcoholic beverage</a>, in order to provide guidance on total alcohol consumption.

A number of other countries (including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US) use the concept of a "<a href="standard%20drink">standard drink</a>", the definition of which varies from country to country, for the same purpose. "Standard drinks" were referred to in the first UK guidelines (1984) that published "safe limits" for drinking, but these were replaced by references to "alcohol units" in the 1987 guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance.

One unit of alcohol (UK) is defined as 10 <a href="litre">millilitres</a> (8 <a href="grams">grams</a>) of pure <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a>. Typical drinks (i.e., typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic beverages) may contain 1–3 units of alcohol.

Containers of alcoholic beverages sold directly to UK consumers are normally labelled to indicate the number of units of alcohol in a typical serving of the beverage (optional) and in the full container (can or bottle), as well as information about responsible drinking.

As an approximate guideline, a typical healthy adult can metabolise (break down) about one unit of alcohol per hour, although this may vary depending on sex, age, weight, health, and many other factors.

The number of UK units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying the volume of the drink (in millilitres) by its percentage <a href="Alcohol%20by%20volume">ABV</a>, and dividing by 1000.

For example, one <a href="Imperial%20units">imperial</a> <a href="pint">pint</a> (568 ml) of beer at 4% <a href="alcohol%20by%20volume">alcohol by volume</a> (ABV) contains:

The formula uses . This results in exactly one unit per percentage point per litre, of any alcoholic beverage.

The formula can be simplified for everyday use by expressing the serving size in <a href="centilitre">centilitre</a>s and the alcohol content literally as a <a href="percentage">percentage</a>.

Thus, a 750 ml bottle of wine at 12% ABV contains 75 cl × 12% = 9 units. Alternatively, the serving size in litres multiplied by the alcohol content as a number, the above example giving 0.75 × 12 = 9 units.

Both pieces of input data are usually mentioned in this form on the bottle, so is easy to retrieve.

UK alcohol companies pledged in March 2011 to implement an innovative health labelling scheme to provide more information about responsible drinking on alcohol labels and containers. This voluntary scheme is the first of its kind in Europe and has been developed in conjunction with the UK Department of Health. The pledge stated:

At the end of 2014, 101 companies had committed to the pledge labelling scheme.

There are five elements included within the overall labelling scheme, the first three being mandatory, and the last two optional:

Drinks companies had pledged to display the three mandatory items on 80% of drinks containers on shelves in the UK off-trade by the end of December 2013. A report published in Nov 2014, confirmed that UK drinks producers had delivered on that pledge with a 79.3% compliance with the pledge elements as measured by products on shelf. Compared with labels from 2008 on a like-for-like basis, information on Unit alcohol content had increased by 46%; 91% of products displayed alcohol and pregnancy warnings (18% in 2008); and 75% showed the Chief Medical Officers’ lower risk daily guidelines (6% in 2008).

It is sometimes misleadingly stated that there is one unit per half-pint of beer, or small glass of wine, or single measure of spirits. However, such statements do not take into account the various strengths and volumes supplied in practice.

For example, the ABV of beer typically varies from 3.5% to 5.5%. A typical "medium" glass of wine with 175 ml at 12% ABV has 2.1 units. And spirits, although typically 35–40% ABV, have single measures of 25 ml or 35 ml (so 1 or 1.4 units) depending on location.

The misleading nature of "one unit per half-pint of beer, or small glass of wine, or single measure of spirits" can lead to people underestimating their alcohol intake.




Most <a href="Distilled%20beverage">spirits</a> sold in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> have 40% ABV or slightly less. In England, a single pub measure (25 ml) of a spirit contains one unit. However, a larger 35 ml measure is increasingly used (and in particular is standard in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> ), which contains 1.4 units of alcohol at 40% ABV. Sellers of spirits by the glass must state the capacity of their standard measure in ml.


On average, it takes about one hour for the body to <a href="Metabolism">metabolise</a> (break down) one unit of alcohol. However, this will vary with body weight, sex, age, personal metabolic rate, recent food intake, the type and strength of the alcohol, and medications taken. Alcohol may be metabolised more slowly if <a href="liver">liver</a> function is impaired.

From 1992 to 1995, the UK government advised that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14. (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women.) <a href="The%20Times">The Times</a> reported in October 2007 that these limits had been "plucked out of the air" and had no scientific basis.

This was changed after a government study showed that many people were in effect "saving up" their units and using them at the end of the week, a phenomenon referred to as <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a>. Since 1995 the advice was that regular consumption of 3–4 units a day for men, or 2–3 units a day for women, would not pose significant health risks, but that consistently drinking four or more units a day (men), or three or more units a day (women), is not advisable.

An international study of about 6,000 men and 11,000 women for a total of 75,000 person-years found that people who reported that they drank more than a threshold value of 2 units of alcohol a day had a higher risk of fractures than non-drinkers. For example, those who drank over 3 units a day had nearly twice the risk of a hip fracture.

Ally McBeal

Ally McBeal is an American <a href="legal%20drama">legal</a> <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> <a href="television%20series">television series</a>, originally aired on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> from September 8, 1997 to May 20, 2002. Created by <a href="David%20E.%20Kelley">David E. Kelley</a>, the series stars <a href="Calista%20Flockhart">Calista Flockhart</a> in the <a href="Ally%20McBeal%20%28character%29">title role</a> as a lawyer working in the fictional <a href="Boston">Boston</a> <a href="List%20of%20fictional%20law%20firms">law firm</a> Cage and Fish, with other lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous, and dramatic. The series received critical acclaim in its early seasons, winning the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Television%20Series%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy</a> in 1997 and 1998, and also winning the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Comedy%20Series">Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series</a> in 1999.

The series, set in the fictional <a href="Boston">Boston</a> <a href="List%20of%20fictional%20law%20firms">law firm</a> Cage and Fish, begins with main character <a href="Ally%20McBeal%20%28character%29">Allison Marie "Ally" McBeal</a> joining the firm (co-owned by her law school classmate Richard Fish, played by <a href="Greg%20Germann">Greg Germann</a>) after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment. On her first day Ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex-boyfriend Billy Thomas (<a href="Gil%20Bellows">Gil Bellows</a>)—whom she has never gotten over. To make things worse, Billy is now married to fellow lawyer Georgia (<a href="Courtney%20Thorne-Smith">Courtney Thorne-Smith</a>), who also later joins Cage and Fish. The triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the show's first three seasons.

Although ostensibly a legal drama, the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as <a href="plot%20device">plot device</a>s to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend. Legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.

Cage & Fish (which becomes Cage/Fish & McBeal or Cage, Fish, & Associates towards the end of the series), the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment symbolized by its unisex restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with each other and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.

The series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Ally's tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, or Richard Fish's <a href="Wattle%20%28anatomy%29">wattle</a> fetish and humorous mottos ("Fishisms" & "Bygones"), or John's gymnastic dismounts out of the office's unisex bathroom stalls, or the dancing twins (played by Eric & Steve Cohen) at the bar, that ran through the series. The show used vivid, dramatic <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; particularly notable is the <a href="dancing%20baby">dancing baby</a>.

The series also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer <a href="Vonda%20Shepard">Vonda Shepard</a> regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters). The series also took place in the same <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> as David E. Kelley's legal drama "<a href="The%20Practice">The Practice</a>" (which aired on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>), as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a very rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks.

Ultimately, in the last installment of the fifth and final season, "Bygones," Ally decided to resign from Cage & Fish, leave Boston, and return to New York City.

In Australia, "Ally McBeal" was aired by the Seven Network from 1997 to 2002. In 2010, it was aired repeatedly by Network Ten.

Seymore Walsh, a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall, was also a recurring character on "The Practice". In addition, Judge Jennifer (Whipper) Cone appears on "The Practice" episode "Line of Duty" (S02 E15), while Judge Roberta Kittelson, a recurring character on "The Practice", has a featured guest role in the "Ally McBeal" episode "Do you Wanna Dance?"

Most of the primary "Practice" cast members guest starred in the "Ally McBeal" episode "The Inmates" (S01 E20), in a storyline that concluded with the "Practice" episode "Axe Murderer" (S02 E26), featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their "Ally" characters. What's unusual about this continuing storyline is that "Ally McBeal" and "The Practice" aired on different networks. Bobby Donnell, the main character of "The Practice" played by <a href="Dylan%20McDermott">Dylan McDermott</a>, was featured heavily in both this crossover and another "Ally McBeal" episode, "These are the Days".

Regular "Practice" cast members <a href="Lara%20Flynn%20Boyle">Lara Flynn Boyle</a> and <a href="Michael%20Badalucco">Michael Badalucco</a> each had a cameo in "Ally McBeal" (Boyle as a woman who trades insults with Ally in the episode "Making Spirits Bright" and Badalucco as one of Ally's dates in the episode "I Know him by Heart") but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on "The Practice".

Upon premiering in 1997, the show was an instant hit, averaging around 11 million viewers per episode. The show's second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became a top 20 show, averaging around 13 million viewers per episode. The show's ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after <a href="Robert%20Downey%2C%20Jr.">Robert Downey, Jr.</a> joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul, and a fresher aesthetic was created by new art director Matthew DeCoste. However, Downey's character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor's troubles with drug addiction.

The first two seasons, as well as the fourth, remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the Emmys, SAG Awards and the Golden Globes. In 2007 Ally McBeal placed #48 on "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" 2007 "New TV Classics" list.

"Ally McBeal" received some criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women (specifically regarding professional women) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts, and emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 29, 1998 cover story of "Time" magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists (<a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, <a href="Betty%20Friedan">Betty Friedan</a>, <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>) and asked "Is Feminism Dead?" In episode 12 of the second season of the show, Ally talks to her co-worker John Cage about a dream she had, saying "You know, I had a dream that they put my face on the cover of "Time" magazine as 'the face of feminism'."

"Ally McBeal" was a heavily music-oriented show. <a href="Vonda%20Shepard">Vonda Shepard</a>, a virtually unknown musician at the time, was featured continually on the show. Her song "Searchin' My Soul" became the show's theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode, including "<a href="Both%20Sides%20Now%20%28song%29">Both Sides Now</a>", "<a href="Hooked%20on%20a%20Feeling">Hooked on a Feeling</a>" and "<a href="Tell%20Him%20%28Bert%20Berns%20song%29">Tell Him</a>". Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local <a href="piano%20bar">piano bar</a> frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue. A portion of "Searchin' My Soul" was played at the beginning of each episode, but remarkably the song was never played in its entirety.

Several of the characters had a musical <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> that played when they appeared. John Cage's was "<a href="You%27re%20the%20First%2C%20the%20Last%2C%20My%20Everything">You're the First, the Last, My Everything</a>", Ling Woo's was the <a href="Wicked%20Witch%20of%20the%20West">Wicked Witch of the West</a> theme from "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>", and Ally McBeal herself picked "<a href="Tell%20Him%20%28Bert%20Berns%20song%29">Tell Him</a>", when told by a psychiatrist that she needed a theme.

Due to the popularity of the show and Shepard's music, a soundtrack titled "<a href="Songs%20from%20Ally%20McBeal">Songs from Ally McBeal</a>" was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled "Heart and Soul: New Songs From Ally McBeal" in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. A Christmas album was also released under the title "Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas". The album received positive reviews, and Shephard’s version of <a href="Kay%20Starr">Kay Starr</a>’s Christmas song <a href="%28Everybody%27s%20Waitin%27%20For%29%20The%20Man%20with%20the%20Bag">(Everybody's Waitin' For) The Man with the Bag</a>, received considerable airplay during the holiday season.

Other artists featured on the show include <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, <a href="Barry%20White">Barry White</a>, <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a>, <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>, <a href="Macy%20Gray">Macy Gray</a>, <a href="Gloria%20Gaynor">Gloria Gaynor</a>, <a href="Chayanne">Chayanne</a>, <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>, <a href="Anastacia">Anastacia</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a> and <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a>. <a href="Josh%20Groban">Josh Groban</a> played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the May 2001 season finale, performing "You're Still You". The series creator, David E. Kelley, was impressed with Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event and based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for him in that finale. The background score for the show was composed by <a href="Danny%20Lux">Danny Lux</a>.

Due to <a href="music%20licensing">music licensing</a> issues, none of the seasons of "Ally McBeal" were available on DVD in the United States (only 6 random episodes could be found on the R1 edition) until 2009, though the show had been available in Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan, Hong Kong, Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, and the Czech Republic with all the show's music intact since 2005. In the UK, Ireland, and Spain all seasons are available in a complete box set.

<a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">20th Century Fox</a> released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 on October 6, 2009. They also released a special complete series edition on the same day. Season 1 does not contain any special features, but the complete series set contains several bonus features, including featurettes, an all-new retrospective, the <a href="List%20of%20The%20Practice%20episodes%23Season%202">episode</a> of "<a href="The%20Practice">The Practice</a>" in which Calista Flockhart guest starred, and a bonus disc entitled "The Best of Ally McBeal Soundtrack." In addition, both releases contain all of the original music. Season 2 was released on April 6, 2010. Seasons 3, 4, and 5 were all released on October 5, 2010.

In 1999, at the height of the show's popularity, a half-hour version entitled "Ally" began airing in parallel with the main program. This version, designed in a sitcom format, used re-edited scenes from the main program, along with previously unseen footage. The intention was to further develop the plots in the comedy-drama in a sitcom style. It also focused only on Ally's personal life, cutting all the courtroom plots. The repackaged show was cancelled partway through its initial run. While 13 episodes of "Ally" were produced, only ten aired.

McBeal and 1990s <a href="yuppie">young affluent professional</a> women were parodied in the song "Ally McBeal" (tune of "<a href="Like%20a%20Rolling%20Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>" by <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>) by a cappella group <a href="Da%20Vinci%27s%20Notebook">Da Vinci's Notebook</a> on their album "The Life and Times of Mike Fanning", released in 2000.

In episode 2, season 3 of the British comedy "<a href="The%20Adam%20and%20Joe%20Show">The Adam and Joe Show</a>", the show was parodied as "Ally McSqeal" using soft toys.

Episode 12 of the first season of "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>", "<a href="When%20Aliens%20Attack">When Aliens Attack</a>", centers on an invasion of Earth by the Omicronians precipitated by a signal loss during the climax of an episode of "Single Female Lawyer", whose main character is Jenny McNeal.

Andreas Capellanus

Andreas Capellanus ("Capellanus" meaning "chaplain"), also known as Andrew the Chaplain, and occasionally by a French translation of his name, André le Chapelain, was the 12th-century author of a treatise commonly known as "<a href="De%20amore%20%28Andreas%20Capellanus%29">De amore</a>" ("About Love"), and often known in English, somewhat misleadingly, as "The Art of Courtly Love", though its realistic, somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a>. Little is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of <a href="Marie%20de%20Champagne">Marie de Champagne</a>, and probably of French origin.

"De Amore" was written at the request of <a href="Marie%20de%20Champagne">Marie de Champagne</a>, daughter of King <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> and of <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>. In it, the author informs a young pupil, Walter, of the pitfalls of love. A dismissive allusion in the text to the "wealth of Hungary" has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when <a href="Bela%20III%20of%20Hungary">Bela III of Hungary</a> had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's half-sister <a href="Margaret%20of%20France%2C%20Queen%20of%20England%20and%20Hungary">Marguerite of France</a>, but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted.

"De Amore" is made up of three books. The first book covers the etymology and definition of love and is written in the manner of an academic lecture. The second book consists of sample dialogues between members of different social classes; it outlines how the romantic process between the classes should work. pageRank.Book three is made of stories from actual courts of love presided over by noble women.

<a href="John%20Jay%20Parry">John Jay Parry</a>, the editor of one modern edition of "De Amore", quotes critic Robert Bossuat as describing "De Amore" as "one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization". It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.

The social system of "courtly love", as gradually elaborated by the <a href="Proven%C3%A7al%20literature">Provençal</a> <a href="troubadour">troubadour</a>s from the mid twelfth century, soon spread. One of the circles in which this poetry and its ethic were cultivated was the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, <a href="William%20IX%20of%20Aquitaine">William IX of Aquitaine</a>). It has been claimed that "De Amore" codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1170 and 1174, though it was evidently written at least ten years later and, apparently, at Troyes. It deals with several specific themes that were the subject of <a href="poetical%20debate%20%28Occitan%20literature%29">poetical debate</a> among late twelfth century troubadours and <a href="trobairitz">trobairitz</a>.

The meaning of "De Amore" has been debated over the centuries. In the years immediately following its release many people took Andreas’ opinions concerning <a href="Courtly%20Love">Courtly Love</a> seriously. In more recent times, however, scholars have come to view the priest’s work as satirical. Many scholars now agree that Andreas was commenting on the materialistic, superficial nature of the nobles of the Middle Ages. Andreas seems to have been warning young Walter, his protege, about love in the Middle Ages.

<doc id="1950" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1950" title="American Civil Liberties Union">
American Civil Liberties Union

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a <a href="Nonpartisanism">nonpartisan</a> nonprofit organization whose stated mission is "to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a> and laws of the United States." It works through <a href="litigation">litigation</a> and <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a>. The ACLU has over 1,000,000 members and an annual budget of over $100 million. Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in almost all 50 states, the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>, and Puerto Rico. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a> to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" <a href="brief%20%28law%29">briefs</a> expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.

In addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include: opposing the death penalty; supporting <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States">same-sex marriage</a> and the <a href="LGBT%20adoption">right of LGBT people to adopt</a>; supporting <a href="Reproductive%20rights">birth control and abortion rights</a>; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.

Legally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated <a href="nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit organization</a>s: the American Civil Liberties Union, a <a href="501%28c%29%284%29">501(c)(4)</a> social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a <a href="501%28c%29%283%29">501(c)(3)</a> <a href="public%20charity">public charity</a>. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political <a href="lobbying">lobbying</a>. The two organizations share office space and employees.

The ACLU was founded in 1920 by <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a>, <a href="Roger%20Nash%20Baldwin">Roger Baldwin</a>, <a href="Crystal%20Eastman">Crystal Eastman</a>, <a href="Walter%20Nelles">Walter Nelles</a>, <a href="Morris%20Ernst">Morris Ernst</a>, <a href="Albert%20DeSilver">Albert DeSilver</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Garfield%20Hays">Arthur Garfield Hays</a>, <a href="Jane%20Addams">Jane Addams</a>, <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Gurley%20Flynn">Elizabeth Gurley Flynn</a>, and its focus was on <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, primarily for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and working with the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) to decrease <a href="racism">racism</a> and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating <a href="police%20misconduct">police misconduct</a> and supporting <a href="Native%20American%20rights">Native American rights</a>. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Communist party</a> members and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to <a href="Japanese%20American%20internment">internment camps</a>. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.

By 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">separation of church and state</a>. It defended several <a href="anti-war%20activist">anti-war activist</a>s during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The ACLU was involved in <a href="Miranda%20v.%20Arizona">the "Miranda" case</a>, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">the "New York Times" case</a>, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of <a href="creationism">creationism</a> in public schools and challenged some provisions of <a href="Patriot%20Act">anti-terrorism legislation</a> as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%202016">2016 election</a>; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.

The ACLU is led by a president and an executive director, <a href="Susan%20N.%20Herman">Susan N. Herman</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Romero">Anthony Romero</a>, respectively, in 2015. The president acts as chairman of the ACLU's board of directors, leads fundraising, and facilitates policy-setting. The executive director manages the day-to-day operations of the organization. The board of directors consists of 80 persons, including representatives from each state affiliate, as well as at-large delegates. The organization has its headquarters in 125 Broad Street, a 40-story skyscraper located in <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

The leadership of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent <a href="Benjamin%20Spock">Dr. Benjamin Spock</a>'s anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict about whether or not a <a href="gag%20rule">gag rule</a> should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.

In the year ending March 31, 2014, the ACLU and the ACLU Foundation had a combined income from support and revenue of $100.4 million, originating from grants (50.0%), membership donations (25.4%), donated legal services (7.6%), bequests (16.2%), and revenue (0.9%). Membership dues are treated as donations; members choose the amount they pay annually, averaging approximately $50 per member per year. In the year ending March 31, 2014, the combined expenses of the ACLU and ACLU Foundation were $133.4 million, spent on programs (86.2%), management (7.4%), and fundraising (8.2%). (After factoring in other changes in net assets of +$30.9 million, from sources such as investment income, the organization had an overall decrease in net assets of $2.1 million.) Over the period from 2011 to 2014 the ACLU Foundation, on the average, has accounted for roughly 70% of the combined budget, and the ACLU roughly 30%.

The ACLU solicits donations to its charitable foundation. The ACLU is accredited by the <a href="Better%20Business%20Bureau">Better Business Bureau</a>, and the <a href="Charity%20Navigator">Charity Navigator</a> has ranked the ACLU with a four-star rating. The local affiliates solicit their own funding; however, some also receive funds from the national ACLU, with the distribution and amount of such assistance varying from state to state. At its discretion, the national organization provides subsidies to smaller affiliates that lack sufficient resources to be self-sustaining; for example, the Wyoming ACLU chapter received such subsidies until April 2015, when, as part of a round of layoffs at the national ACLU, the Wyoming office was closed.

In October 2004, the ACLU rejected $1.5 million from both the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> and <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> because the Foundations had adopted language from the USA PATRIOT Act in their donation agreements, including a clause stipulating that none of the money would go to "underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities." The ACLU views this clause, both in Federal law and in the donors' agreements, as a threat to civil liberties, saying it is overly broad and ambiguous.

Due to the nature of its legal work, the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies, which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments; a town, state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently, but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver. In some cases, the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief. In particular, the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Attorney%27s%20Fees%20Award%20Act%20of%201976">Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976</a> leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases. Fee awards under this civil rights statute are considered "equitable relief" rather than damages, and government entities are not immune from equitable relief. Under laws such as this, the ACLU and its state affiliates sometimes share in monetary judgments against government agencies. In 2006, the <a href="Veterans%27%20Memorials%2C%20Boy%20Scouts%2C%20Public%20Seals%2C%20and%20Other%20Public%20Expressions%20of%20Religion%20Protection%20Act%20of%202006">Public Expressions of Religion Protection Act</a> sought to prevent monetary judgments in the particular case of violations of church-state separation.

The ACLU has received court awarded fees from opponents, for example, the Georgia affiliate was awarded $150,000 in fees after suing a county demanding the removal of a <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> display from its courthouse; a second Ten Commandments case in the State, in a different county, led to a $74,462 judgment. The <a href="State%20of%20Tennessee">State of Tennessee</a> was required to pay $50,000, the State of Alabama $175,000, and the State of Kentucky $121,500, in similar Ten Commandments cases.

Most of the organization's workload is performed by its local affiliates. There is at least one affiliate organization in each state except Wyoming, as well as one in Washington, D.C. and in Puerto Rico. California has three affiliates. The affiliates operate autonomously from the national organization; each affiliate has its own staff, executive director, board of directors, and budget. Each affiliate consists of two non-profit corporations: a <a href="501%28c%29%283%29">501(c)(3)</a> corporation that does not perform lobbying, and a <a href="501%28c%29%284%29">501(c)(4)</a> corporation which is entitled to lobby.

ACLU affiliates are the basic unit of the ACLU's organization and engage in litigation, lobbying, and public education. For example, in a twenty-month period beginning January 2004, the ACLU's New Jersey chapter was involved in fifty-one cases according to their annual report—thirty-five cases in state courts, and sixteen in <a href="United%20States%20federal%20courts">federal court</a>. They provided legal representation in thirty-three of those cases, and served as amicus in the remaining eighteen. They listed forty-four volunteer attorneys who assisted them in those cases. 

The ACLU's official position statements, as of January 2012, included the following policies:

The ACLU is supported by a variety of persons and organizations. There were over 1,000,000 members in 2017, and the ACLU annually receives thousands of grants from hundreds of charitable foundations. Allies of the ACLU in legal actions have included the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, the <a href="American%20Jewish%20Congress">American Jewish Congress</a>, <a href="People%20For%20the%20American%20Way">People For the American Way</a>, the <a href="National%20Rifle%20Association">National Rifle Association</a>, the <a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, <a href="Americans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>, and the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women</a>.

The ACLU has been criticized by liberals, such as when it excluded Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, or when it opposed the passage of the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Act">National Labor Relations Act</a>. Conversely, it has been criticized by conservatives, such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as <a href="Rush%20Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, and <a href="Oliver%20North">Oliver North</a>; and it has supported liberal figures such as <a href="Dick%20Gregory">Dick Gregory</a>, <a href="Rockwell%20Kent">Rockwell Kent</a>, and <a href="Dr.%20Benjamin%20Spock">Dr. Benjamin Spock</a>.

A major source of criticism are legal cases in which the ACLU represents an individual or organization that promotes offensive or unpopular viewpoints, such as the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, <a href="Neo-Nazism">Neo-Nazis</a>, <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, <a href="North%20American%20Man/Boy%20Love%20Association">North American Man/Boy Love Association</a>, or <a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>. The ACLU responded to these criticisms by stating "It is easy to defend freedom of speech when the message is something many people find at least reasonable. But the defense of freedom of speech is most critical when the message is one most people find repulsive."

The ACLU developed from the <a href="National%20Civil%20Liberties%20Bureau">National Civil Liberties Bureau</a> (CLB), co-founded in 1917 during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> by <a href="Crystal%20Eastman">Crystal Eastman</a>, an attorney activist, and <a href="Roger%20Nash%20Baldwin">Roger Nash Baldwin</a>. The focus of the CLB was on <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, primarily anti-war speech, and on supporting <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>s who did not want to serve in World War I.

Three <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> decisions in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against certain kinds of anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the <a href="Schenck%20v.%20United%20States">conviction</a> of <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Socialist Party</a> leader <a href="Charles%20Schenck">Charles Schenck</a> for publishing anti-war literature. In "<a href="Debs%20v.%20United%20States">Debs v. United States</a>," the court upheld the conviction of <a href="Eugene%20Debs">Eugene Debs</a>. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in "<a href="Abrams%20v.%20United%20States">Abrams v. United States</a>", Justice <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.

In 1918 Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues. After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.

The CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (<a href="NAACP">NAACP</a>) and <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era%20%28United%20States%29">disfranchisement</a> of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.

During the first decades of the ACLU, <a href="Roger%20Nash%20Baldwin">Baldwin</a> continued as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the <a href="Garland%20Fund">Garland Fund</a>.

In the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity <a href="Comstock%20laws">Comstock laws</a>; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author <a href="Upton%20Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a> was arrested for trying to read the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> during an <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> rally.

ACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, <a href="Arthur%20Garfield%20Hays">Arthur Garfield Hays</a> and <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a>, believed that direct, militant action was the best path. Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including <a href="Walter%20Nelles">Walter Nelles</a> and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.

During the 1920s, the ACLU's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor movement particularly. Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, the <a href="National%20Civic%20Federation">National Civic Federation</a>, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.

In addition to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools. The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921. The ACLU, working with the <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a>, also supported racial discrimination cases. The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923. There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, <a href="Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">government search and seizure</a> issues, <a href="Privacy%20laws%20of%20the%20United%20States">right to privacy</a>, or <a href="wiretapping">wiretapping</a>.

The <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party USA</a> was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.

When 1925 arrived – five years after the ACLU was formed – the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts. That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded <a href="John%20T.%20Scopes">John T. Scopes</a> to defy Tennessee's anti-<a href="evolution">evolution</a> law in "<a href="Scopes%20Trial">The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes</a>". <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a>, a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching <a href="creationism">creationism</a> in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100. The Tennessee Supreme Court later upheld the law but overturned the conviction on a technicality.

The Scopes trial was a phenomenal public relations success for the ACLU. The ACLU became well known across America, and the case led to the first endorsement of the ACLU by a major U.S. newspaper. The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case "<a href="McLean%20v.%20Arkansas">McLean v. Arkansas</a>" and the 2005 case "<a href="Kitzmiller%20v.%20Dover%20Area%20School%20District">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a>".

Baldwin himself was involved in an important free speech victory of the 1920s, after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey. Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given "liberal and comprehensive construction", and it marked a major turning point in the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.

The most important ACLU case of the 1920s was "<a href="Gitlow%20v.%20New%20York">Gitlow v. New York</a>", in which <a href="Benjamin%20Gitlow">Benjamin Gitlow</a> was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism. Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the <a href="incorporation%20doctrine">incorporation doctrine</a>) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.

Leaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a> felt that legislation was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But <a href="Walter%20Herries%20Pollock">Walter Pollack</a>, <a href="Morris%20Ernst">Morris Ernst</a>, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.

Censorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization. Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature. In that year, <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned "<a href="American%20Mercury">American Mercury</a>" magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal. The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20One%20Book%20Called%20Ulysses">United States v. One pageRank.Book Called Ulysses</a>" in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>" by <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>. The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the "<a href="Roth%20v.%20United%20States">Roth v. United States</a>" and "<a href="Memoirs%20v.%20Massachusetts">Memoirs v. Massachusetts</a>" cases.

The <a href="Comstock%20laws">Comstock laws</a> banned distribution of sex education information, based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior <a href="Mary%20Ware%20Dennett">Mary Ware Dennett</a> was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge <a href="Learned%20Hand">Learned Hand</a> ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to "promote understanding".

The success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature. The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort. By the early 1930s, <a href="censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censorship in the United States</a> was diminishing.

Two major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In "<a href="Stromberg%20v.%20California">Stromberg v. California</a>", decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the <a href="Due%20Process%20Clause">Due Process Clause</a> of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">14th amendment</a> to subject states to the requirements of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. In "<a href="Near%20v.%20Minnesota">Near v. Minnesota</a>", also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise <a href="prior%20restraint">prior restraint</a> and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.

The late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in "<a href="Hague%20v.%20Committee%20for%20Industrial%20Organization">Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization</a>" affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a> began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.

In 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States. Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, <a href="African%20American">African American</a> rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.

The ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 <a href="Norris%E2%80%93La%20Guardia%20Act">Norris–La Guardia Act</a>, a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions. The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report "Lawlessness in Law Enforcement" in 1931, under the auspices of <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>'s <a href="Wickersham%20Commission">Wickersham Commission</a>. In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the <a href="Indian%20Reorganization%20Act">Indian Reorganization Act</a>, which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.

Although the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU did engage in educational efforts, and published "Black Justice" in 1931, a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system. Funded by the <a href="Garland%20Fund">Garland Fund</a>, the ACLU also participated in producing the influential Margold Report, which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks. The ACLU's plan was to demonstrate that the "<a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a>" policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.

In 1932twelve years after the ACLU was foundedit had achieved significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general. But the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.

The <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> administration proposed the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the <a href="National%20Recovery%20Administration">National Recovery Administration</a> suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to key positions, including Interior Secretary <a href="Harold%20L.%20Ickes">Harold Ickes</a>, a member of the ACLU.

The economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.

The Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s.

The ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 <a href="court-packing%20plan">court-packing plan</a>, which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation. The Supreme Court responded by making a <a href="The%20switch%20in%20time%20that%20saved%20nine">major shift in policy</a>, and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.

The first decision that marked the court's new direction was "<a href="De%20Jonge%20v.%20Oregon">De Jonge v. Oregon</a>", in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization. The ACLU attorney <a href="Osmond%20Fraenkel">Osmond Fraenkel</a>, working with <a href="International%20Labor%20Defense">International Labor Defense</a>, defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that "peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime." The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a>, <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Murphy">Frank Murphy</a>) established a body of civil liberties law. In 1938, Justice <a href="Harlan%20F.%20Stone">Harlan F. Stone</a> wrote the famous "footnote four" in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Carolene%20Products%20Co.">United States v. Carolene Products Co.</a>" in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties wouldhenceforthrequire compelling justification.

Senator <a href="Robert%20F.%20Wagner">Robert F. Wagner</a> proposed the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Act">National Labor Relations Act</a> in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader <a href="Arthur%20Garfield%20Hays">Arthur Garfield Hays</a> proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.

The ACLU's support of the NLRB was a major development for the ACLU, because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties. Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.

Some factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.

The ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties. One such defendant was the <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, who were involved in a <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court%20cases%20involving%20Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">large number of Supreme Court cases</a>. Cases that the ACLU supported included "<a href="Lovell%20v.%20City%20of%20Griffin">Lovell v. City of Griffin</a>" (which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute "literature of any kind"); "<a href="Martin%20v.%20Struthers">Martin v. Struthers</a>" (which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and "<a href="Cantwell%20v.%20Connecticut">Cantwell v. Connecticut</a>" (which reversed the conviction of a Witness who was reciting offensive speech on a street corner).

The most important cases involved statutes requiring flag salutes. The Jehovah's Witnesses felt that saluting a flag was contrary to their religious beliefs. Two children were convicted in 1938 of not saluting the flag. The ACLU supported their appeal to the Supreme Court, but the court affirmed the conviction, in 1940. But three years later, in "<a href="West%20Virginia%20State%20Board%20of%20Education%20v.%20Barnette">West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</a>", the Supreme court reversed itself and wrote "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." To underscore its decision, the Supreme Court announced it on <a href="Flag%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Flag Day</a>.

The rise of <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regimes in Germany, Russia, and other countries who rejected freedom of speech and association had a large impact on the civil liberties movement in the U.S.; anti-communist sentiment rose and civil liberties were curtailed.

The ACLU leadership was divided over whether or not to defend pro-<a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> speech in the United States; pro-labor elements within the ACLU were hostile towards Nazism and fascism, and objected when the ACLU defended Nazis. Several states passed laws outlawing the hate speech directed at ethnic groups. The first person arrested under New Jersey's 1935 hate speech law was a Jehovah's Witness who was charged with disseminating anti-Catholic literature. The ACLU defended the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the charges were dropped. The ACLU proceeded to defend numerous pro-Nazi groups, defending their rights to free speech and free association.

In the late 1930s, the ACLU allied itself with the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States%23The%20Popular%20Front%20%281935%E2%80%931939%29">Popular Front</a>, a coalition of liberal organizations coordinated by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">United States Communist Party</a>. The ACLU benefited because affiliates from the Popular Front could often fight local civil rights battles much more effectively than the New York-based ACLU. The association with the Communist Party led to accusations that the ACLU was a "communist front", particularly because <a href="Harry%20F.%20Ward">Harry F. Ward</a> was both chairman of the ACLU and chairman of the <a href="American%20League%20Against%20War%20and%20Fascism">American League Against War and Fascism</a>, a communist organization.

The <a href="House%20Unamerican%20Activities%20Committee">House Unamerican Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) was created in 1938 to uncover sedition and treason within the United States. When witnesses testified at its hearings, the ACLU was mentioned several times, leading the HUAC to mention the ACLU prominently in its 1939 report. This damaged the ACLU's reputation severely, even though the report said that it could not "definitely state whether or not" the ACLU was a communist organization.

While the ACLU rushed to defend its image against allegations of being a communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC. The ACLU was one of the few organizations to protest (unsuccessfully) against passage of the <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a> in 1940, which would later be used to imprison many persons who supported Communism. The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader <a href="Harry%20Bridges">Harry Bridges</a>.

ACLU leadership was split on whether to purge its leadership of communists. <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a>, <a href="John%20Haynes%20Holmes">John Haynes Holmes</a>, and <a href="Morris%20Ernst">Morris Ernst</a> were anti-communists who wanted to distance the ACLU from communism; opposing them were <a href="Harry%20F.%20Ward">Harry Ward</a>, <a href="Corliss%20Lamont">Corliss Lamont</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Flynn">Elizabeth Flynn</a> who rejected any political test for ACLU leadership. A bitter struggle ensued throughout 1939, and the anti-communists prevailed in February 1940, when the board voted to prohibit anyone who supported totalitarianism from ACLU leadership roles. Chairman Harry Ward immediately resigned, andfollowing a contentious six-hour debateElizabeth Flynn was voted off the ACLU's board. The 1940 resolution was considered by many to be a betrayal of its fundamental principles. The resolution was rescinded in 1968, and Flynn was posthumously reinstated to the ACLU in 1970.

When World War II engulfed the United States, the Bill of Rights was enshrined as a hallowed document, and numerous organizations defended civil liberties. Chicago and New York proclaimed "Civil Rights" weeks, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a national Bill of Rights day. <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> was the keynote speaker at the 1939 ACLU convention. In spite of this newfound respect for civil rights, Americans were becoming adamantly anti-communist, and believed that excluding communists from American society was an essential step to preserve democracy.

Contrasted with World War I, there was relatively little violation of civil liberties during World War II. President Roosevelt was a strong supporter of civil liberties, butmore importantlythere were few anti-war activists during World War II. The most significant exception was the <a href="internment%20of%20Japanese%20Americans">internment of Japanese Americans</a>. Two months after the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Roosevelt authorized the creation of military "exclusion zones" with <a href="Executive%20Order%209066">Executive Order 9066</a>, paving the way for the detention of all West Coast <a href="Japanese%20American">Japanese American</a>s in inland camps. In addition to the non-citizen <a href="Issei">Issei</a> (prohibited from <a href="naturalization">naturalization</a> as members of an "unassimilable" race), over two-thirds of those swept up were American-born citizens. The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt, comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps. The ACLU was the only major organization to object to the internment plan, and their position was very unpopular, even within the organization. Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese Americans; Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt's war effort, but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that Japanese Americans needed access to due process before they could be imprisoned. In a March 20, 1942 letter to Roosevelt, Baldwin called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings, describing the constitutionality of the planned removal "open to grave question." His suggestions went nowhere, and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the "evacuation" of the West Coast. In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose "presence may endanger national security," brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens, and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.

The ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in <a href="Gordon%20Hirabayashi">Gordon Hirabayashi</a>'s lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney <a href="A.L.%20Wirin">A.L. Wirin</a> continued to represent <a href="Ernest%20Kinzo%20Wakayama">Ernest Kinzo Wakayama</a> but without addressing the case's constitutional questions. (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.) However, the San Francisco branch, led by <a href="Ernest%20Besig">Ernest Besig</a>, refused to discontinue its support for <a href="Fred%20Korematsu">Fred Korematsu</a>, whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney <a href="Wayne%20M.%20Collins">Wayne Collins</a>, with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.

The West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court, but had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court. "<a href="Hirabayashi%20v.%20United%20States">Hirabayashi v. United States</a>" came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast; although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an <a href="Amicus%20brief">"amicus" brief</a>. Besig, dissatisfied with <a href="Osmond%20Fraenkel">Osmond Fraenkel</a>'s tamer defense, filed an additional "amicus" brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in "<a href="Yasui%20v.%20United%20States">Yasui v. United States</a>" (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, "<a href="ex%20parte%20Endo">ex parte Endo</a>", was also aided by two "amicus" briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.

"<a href="Korematsu%20v.%20United%20States">Korematsu v. United States</a>" proved to be the most controversial of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to national pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside <a href="Charles%20Antone%20Horsky">Charles Horsky</a>, although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed. The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans, although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in "<a href="coram%20nobis">coram nobis</a>" proceedings in the 1980s.

Although the ACLU (somewhat unevenly) defended the Japanese Americans, it was more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States' war effort. Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who <a href="Renunciation%20Act%20of%201944">renounced their U.S. citizenship</a> during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for "repatriation." (A significant number of those slated to "go back" to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated.) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the <a href="Tule%20Lake%20Unit%2C%20World%20War%20II%20Valor%20in%20the%20Pacific%20National%20Monument">Tule Lake Segregation Center</a>, where the majority of these "renunciants" were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support.

When the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories. President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU on the occasion of their 25th anniversary. American attitudes had changed since World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness. The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed. During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state.

The ACLU supported the African-American defendants in "<a href="Shelley%20v.%20Kraemer">Shelley v. Kraemer</a>", when they tried to occupy a house they had purchased in a neighborhood which had racially restrictive housing covenants. The African-American purchasers won the case in 1945.

Anti-Communist sentiment gripped the United States during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations to lose their jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored the civil rights of Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.

The ACLU was internally divided when it purged Communists from its leadership in 1940, and that ambivalence continued as it decided whether to defend alleged Communists during the late 1940s. Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes. This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.

In 1947, President Truman issued <a href="Executive%20Order%209835">Executive Order 9835</a>, which created the <a href="Federal%20Loyalty%20Program">Federal Loyalty Program</a>. This program authorized the Attorney General to create a list of organizations which were deemed to be subversive. Any association with these programs was ground for barring the person from employment. Listed organizations were not notified that they were being considered for the list, nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list. Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.

Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood directors and writers, the "<a href="Hollywood%20Ten">Hollywood Ten</a>", intending to ask them to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for <a href="contempt%20of%20Congress">contempt of Congress</a>. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a <a href="blacklist">blacklist</a> which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report "The Judges and the Judged", prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress <a href="Jean%20Muir%20%28actress%29">Jean Muir</a>, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.
The federal government took direct aim at the U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the <a href="Foley%20Square%20trial">Foley Square trial</a>. The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.

The ACLU, in a change of heart, supported the party leaders during their appeal process. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions in the "<a href="Dennis%20v.%20United%20States">Dennis v. United States</a>" decision by softening the free speech requirements from a "clear and present danger" test, to a "grave and probable" test. The ACLU issued a public condemnation of the "Dennis" decision, and resolved to fight it. One reason for the Supreme Court's support of cold war legislation was the 1949 deaths of Supreme Court justices <a href="Frank%20Murphy">Frank Murphy</a> and <a href="Wiley%20Rutledge">Wiley Rutledge</a>, leaving <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a> and <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> as the only remaining civil libertarians on the Court.

The "Dennis" decision paved the way for the prosecution of hundreds of other Communist party members. The ACLU supported many of the Communists during their appeals (although most of the initiative originated with local ACLU affiliates, not the national headquarters) but most convictions were upheld. The two California affiliates, in particular, felt the national ACLU headquarters was not supporting civil liberties strongly enough, and they initiated more cold war cases than the national headquarters did.

The ACLU also challenged many loyalty oath requirements across the country, but the courts upheld most of the loyalty oath laws. California ACLU affiliates successfully challenged the California state loyalty oath. The Supreme Court, until 1957, upheld nearly every law which restricted the liberties of Communists.

The ACLU, even though it scaled back its defense of Communists during the Cold War, still came under heavy criticism as a "front" for Communism. Critics included the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a>, Senator <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, the HUAC, and the FBI. Several ACLU leaders were sympathetic to the FBI, and as a consequence, the ACLU rarely investigated any of the many complaints alleging abuse of power by the FBI during the Cold War.

In 1950, <a href="Raymond%20L.%20Wise">Raymond L. Wise</a>, ACLU board member 1933–1951, defended <a href="William%20Perl">William Perl</a>, one of the other spies embroiled in the atomic espionage cases (made famous by the execution of <a href="Julius%20Rosenberg">Julius Rosenberg</a> and <a href="Ethel%20Rosenberg">Ethel Rosenberg</a>).

In 1950, the ACLU board of directors asked executive director Baldwin to resign, feeling that he lacked the organizational skills to lead the 9,000 (and growing) member organization. Baldwin objected, but a majority of the board elected to remove him from the position, and he was replaced by <a href="Patrick%20Murphy%20Malin">Patrick Murphy Malin</a>. Under Malin's guidance, membership tripled to 30,000 by 1955the start of a 24-year period of continual growth leading to 275,000 members in 1974. Malin also presided over an expansion of local ACLU affiliates.

The ACLU, which had been controlled by an elite of a few dozen New Yorkers, became more democratic in the 1950s. In 1951, the ACLU amended its bylaws to permit the local affiliates to participate directly in voting on ACLU policy decisions. A bi-annual conference, open to the entire membership, was instituted in the same year, and in later decades it became a pulpit for activist members, who suggested new directions for the ACLU, including abortion rights, death penalty, and rights of the poor.

During the early 1950s, the ACLU continued to steer a moderate course through the Cold War. When leftist singer <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a> was denied a passport in 1950, even though he was not accused of any illegal acts, the ACLU chose to not defend him. The ACLU later reversed their stance, and supported <a href="William%20Worthy">William Worthy</a> and <a href="Rockwell%20Kent">Rockwell Kent</a> in their passport confiscation cases, which resulted in legal victories in the late 1950s.

In response to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees chose to use the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">fifth amendment</a> protection against <a href="self-incrimination">self-incrimination</a> to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs. Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established polices which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked the fifth amendment. The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading the fifth amendment, but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination.

The fifth amendment issue became the catalyst for a watershed event in 1954, which finally resolved the ACLU's ambivalence by ousting the anti-communists from ACLU leadership. In 1953, the anti-communists, led by <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a> and <a href="James%20Fly">James Fly</a>, proposed a set of resolutions that inferred guilt of persons that invoked the fifth amendment. These resolutions were the first that fell under the ACLU's new organizational rules permitting local affiliates to participate in the vote; the affiliates outvoted the national headquarters, and rejected the anti-communist resolutions. Anti-communists leaders refused to accept the results of the vote, and brought the issue up for discussion again at the 1954 bi-annual convention. ACLU member <a href="Frank%20Porter%20Graham">Frank Graham</a>, president of the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina">University of North Carolina</a>, attacked the anti-communists with a counter-proposal, which stated that the ACLU "stand[s] against guilt by association, judgment by accusation, the invasion of privacy of personal opinions and beliefs, and the confusion of dissent with disloyalty." The anti-communists continued to battle Graham's proposal, but were outnumbered by the affiliates. The anti-communists finally gave up and departed the board of directors in late 1954 and 1955, ending an eight-year reign of ambivalence within the ACLU leadership ranks. Thereafter, the ACLU proceeded with firmer resolve against Cold War anti-communist legislation. The period from the 1940 resolution (and the purge of Elizabeth Flynn) to the 1954 resignation of the anti-communist leaders is considered by many to be an era in which the ACLU abandoned its core principles.

McCarthyism declined in late 1954 after television journalist <a href="Edward%20R.%20Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a> and others publicly chastised McCarthy. The controversies over the Bill of Rights that were generated by the Cold War ushered in a new era in American Civil liberties. In 1954 in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>", the Supreme Court unanimously overturned state-sanctioned school segregation, and thereafter a flood of civil rights victories dominated the legal landscape.

The Supreme Court handed the ACLU two key victories in 1957, in "<a href="Watkins%20v.%20United%20States">Watkins v. United States</a>" and "<a href="Yates%20v.%20United%20States">Yates v. United States</a>", both of which undermined the <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a> and marked the beginning of the end of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including "<a href="Lamont%20v.%20Postmaster%20General">Lamont v. Postmaster General</a>" (in which the plaintiff was <a href="Corliss%20Lamont">Corliss Lamont</a>, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.

The decade from 1954 to 1964 was the most successful period in the ACLU's history. Membership rose from 30,000 to 80,000, and by 1965 it had affiliates in seventeen states. During the ACLU's bi-annual conference in Colorado in 1964, the Supreme Court issued rulings on eight cases in which the ACLU was involved; the ACLU prevailed on seven of the eight. The ACLU played a role in Supreme Court decisions reducing censorship of literature and arts, protecting freedom of association, prohibiting racial segregation, excluding religion from public schools, and providing due process protection to criminal suspects. The ACLU's success arose from changing public attitudes; the American populace was more educated, more tolerant, and more willing to accept unorthodox behavior.

Legal battles concerning the separation of church and state originated in laws dating to 1938 which required religious instruction in school, or provided state funding for religious schools. The Catholic church was a leading proponent of such laws; and the primary opponents (the "separationists") were the ACLU, <a href="Americans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>, and the <a href="American%20Jewish%20Congress">American Jewish Congress</a>. The ACLU led the challenge in the 1947 "<a href="Everson%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Everson v. Board of Education</a>" case, in which Justice Hugo Black wrote "[t]he First Amendment has erected a wall between church and state…. That wall must be kept high and impregnable." It was not clear that the Bill of Rights forbid state governments from supporting religious education, and strong legal arguments were made by religious proponents, arguing that the Supreme Court should not act as a "national school board", and that the Constitution did not govern social issues. However, the ACLU and other advocates of church/state separation persuaded the Court to declare such activities unconstitutional. Historian <a href="Samuel%20Walker%20%28historian%29">Samuel Walker</a> writes that the ACLU's "greatest impact on American life" was its role in persuading the Supreme Court to "constitutionalize" so many public controversies.

In 1948, the ACLU prevailed in the "<a href="McCollum%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">McCollum v. Board of Education</a>" case, which challenged public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from private funds. The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 "<a href="Engel%20v.%20Vitale">Engel v. Vitale</a>" decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the <a href="School%20Prayer%20Amendment">School Prayer Constitutional Amendment</a>, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.

However, not all cases were victories; ACLU lost cases in 1949 and 1961 which challenged state laws requiring commercial businesses to close on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath. The Supreme Court has never overturned such laws, although some states subsequently revoked many of the laws under pressure from commercial interests.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU continued its battle against censorship of art and literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of <a href="Carl%20Jacob%20Kunz">Carl Jacob Kunz</a>, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of <a href="Irving%20Feiner">Irving Feiner</a> who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of <a href="Joseph%20Beahharnais">Joseph Beahharnais</a>, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.

Cities across America routinely banned movies because they were deemed to be "harmful", "offensive", or "immoral"censorship which was validated by the 1915 "<a href="Mutual%20Film%20Corp.%20v.%20Industrial%20Commission%20of%20Ohio">Mutual v. Ohio</a>" Supreme Court decision which held movies to be mere commerce, undeserving of first amendment protection. The film "<a href="L%27Amore%20%28film%29">The Miracle</a>" was banned in New York in 1951, at the behest of the Catholic Church, but the ACLU supported the film's distributor in an appeal of the ban, and won a major victory in the 1952 decision "<a href="Joseph%20Burstyn%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Wilson">Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson</a>". The Catholic Church led efforts throughout the 1950s attempting to persuade local prosecutors to ban various books and movies, leading to conflict with the ACLU when the ACLU published it statement condemning the church's tactics. Further legal actions by the ACLU successfully defended films such as "<a href="M%20%281951%20film%29">M</a>" and "<a href="La%20Ronde%20%281950%20film%29">la Ronde</a>", leading the eventual dismantling of movie censorship. Hollywood continued employing self-censorship with its own <a href="Production%20Code">Production Code</a>, but in 1956 the ACLU called on Hollywood to abolish the Code.

The ACLU defended <a href="beat%20generation">beat generation</a> artists, including <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> who was prosecuted for his poem "<a href="Howl">Howl</a>"; andin an unorthodox case the ACLU helped a coffee house regain its restaurant license which was revoked because its Beat customers were allegedly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood.

The ACLU lost an <a href="Roth%20v.%20United%20States">important press censorship case</a> when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher <a href="Samuel%20Roth">Samuel Roth</a> for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, books such as "<a href="Tropic%20of%20Cancer%20%28novel%29">Tropic of Cancer</a>" and "<a href="From%20Here%20to%20Eternity%20%28novel%29">From Here to Eternity</a>" were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.

A major aspect of civil liberties progress after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), the ACLU, and the <a href="American%20Jewish%20Congress">American Jewish Congress</a>. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney <a href="Thurgood%20Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a>), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with <a href="amicus%20brief">amicus brief</a>s. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the "<a href="Henderson%20v.%20United%20States%20%281950%29">Henderson v. United States</a>" decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.

In 1954, the ACLU filed an <a href="amicus%20brief">amicus brief</a> in the case of "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>", which led to the ban on racial segregation in U.S. <a href="Public%20school%20%28government%20funded%29">public schools</a>. Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting it to disclose membership lists. The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower income urban residents, in "<a href="Reynolds%20v.%20Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a>", which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the "one person, one vote" principle.

The ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case "<a href="Powell%20v.%20Alabama">Powell v. Alabama</a>" (right to an attorney), and including 1942's "<a href="Betts%20v.%20Brady">Betts v. Brady</a>" (right to an attorney), and 1951's "<a href="Rochin%20v.%20California">Rochin v. California</a>" (involuntary stomach pumping). In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct. The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board. In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, "Secret Detention by the Chicago Police", which documented unlawful detention by police.

Some of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's "<a href="Mapp%20v.%20Ohio">Mapp v. Ohio</a>", the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The "<a href="Gideon%20v.%20Wainwright">Gideon v. Wainwright</a>" decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in "<a href="Escobedo%20v.%20Illinois">Escobedo v. Illinois</a>", to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning. And, in 1966, "<a href="Miranda%20v.%20Arizona">Miranda v. Arizona</a>" federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to <a href="Minor%20%28law%29">juveniles</a> in the following year's "<a href="in%20re%20Gault">in re Gault</a>" (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.

The 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth. Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as <a href="sit%20in">sit in</a>s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics. The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a>, <a href="prisoner%27s%20rights">prisoner's rights</a>, <a href="abortion">abortion</a>, rights of the poor, and the death penalty. Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970. In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states. During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving <a href="amicus%20briefs">amicus briefs</a> submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested. At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from "disengaged and elitist" to "emotionally engaged". The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled "How Americans Protest", which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.

African-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students <a href="Greensboro%20sit-ins">staged a sit-in</a> in a segregated North Carolina department store, the <a href="sit-in%20movement">sit-in movement</a> gained momentum across the United States. During 1960-61, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. The ACLU also provided legal help for the <a href="Freedom%20Riders">Freedom Rides</a> in 1961, the <a href="African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281954%E2%80%931968%29%23Integration%20of%20Mississippi%20universities%2C%201956%E2%80%9365">integration of the University of Mississippi</a>, the <a href="Birmingham%20campaign">Birmingham campaign</a> in 1963, and the 1964 <a href="Freedom%20Summer">Freedom Summer</a>.

The NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision. But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestorswhite and blackwho were arrested while protesting in the South. The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters. The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.

In 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to <a href="Charles%20Morgan%2C%20Jr.">Charles Morgan, Jr.</a>, the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries ("<a href="Whitus%20v.%20Georgia">Whitus v. Georgia</a>"), desegregating prisons ("<a href="Lee%20v.%20Washington">Lee v. Washington</a>"), and <a href="Disenfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20era">reforming election laws</a>. The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman <a href="Julian%20Bond">Julian Bond</a> in "<a href="Bond%20v.%20Floyd">Bond v. Floyd</a>", when the <a href="Georgia%20House%20of%20Representatives">Georgia congress</a> refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature. Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train <a href="Green%20Berets">Green Berets</a>. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in "Parker v. Levy", 417 U.S. 733 (1974).

In 1969, the ACLU won a major victory for free speech, when it defended <a href="Dick%20Gregory">Dick Gregory</a> after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in "<a href="Gregory%20v.%20Chicago">Gregory v. Chicago</a>" that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when the hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a "heckler's veto".

The ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending <a href="draft%20resister">draft resister</a>s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">potential impeachment of Richard Nixon</a>, and the use of national security concerns to preemptively <a href="Censorship">censor</a> newspapers.

David J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his <a href="draft%20card">draft card</a>. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: "United States of America v. David J. Miller", 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20O%27Brien">United States v. O'Brien</a>", 391 US 367 (1968). Thirteen-year-old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war, and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in "<a href="Tinker%20v.%20Des%20Moines%20Independent%20Community%20School%20District">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a>". This critical case established that the government may not establish "enclaves" such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeit.
The ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader <a href="James%20Meredith">James Meredith</a>. In the "<a href="Street%20v.%20New%20York">Street v. New York</a>" decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression. The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words "fuck the draft" on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in "<a href="Cohen%20v.%20California">Cohen v. California</a>", held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.

Non-war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision "<a href="Brandenburg%20v.%20Ohio">Brandenburg v. Ohio</a>", which held that only speech which advocated "imminent" violence could be outlawed.

A major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend <a href="Benjamin%20Spock">Benjamin Spock</a> and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the <a href="Kent%20State%20shootings">Kent State shootings</a> in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.

Also in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing "direct" legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent). Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.

The ACLU supported "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" in its 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the <a href="Pentagon%20papers">Pentagon papers</a>. The court upheld the "Times" and ACLU in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">New York Times Co. v. United States</a>" ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action.

As the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate</a> saga unfolded, the ACLU became the first national organization to call for Nixon's impeachment. This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, to claim that the ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.

The decade from 1965 to 1975 saw an expansion of the field of civil liberties. Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing <a href="Aryeh%20Neier">Aryeh Neier</a> to take over from Pemberton as Executive Director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU; he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds, and he created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.

During those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run "enclaves", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens. At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs "enclaves", which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, members of the military, and prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice <a href="Abe%20Fortas">Abe Fortas</a>'s use of the phrase "schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism" in the "<a href="Tinker%20v.%20Des%20Moines">Tinker v. Des Moines</a>" decision.

The ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the "Tinker v. Des Moines" case, and expanded it with cases such as "<a href="Goss%20v.%20Lopez">Goss v. Lopez</a>" which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.

As early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments. In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community. In the landmark 1975 "<a href="O%27Connor%20v.%20Donaldson">O'Connor v. Donaldson</a>" decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal. The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended <a href="Billie%20Boggs">Billie Boggs</a>, a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.

Prior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to police brutality, or deprived of religious reading material. In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney <a href="Phil%20Hirschkop">Phil Hirschkop</a> discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the <a href="Virginia%20State%20Penitentiary%20strike">Virginia State Penitentiary strike</a>, and won an important victory in 1971's "<a href="Landman%20v.%20Royster">Landman v. Royster</a>" which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways. In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the <a href="National%20Prison%20Project">National Prison Project</a>. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as "<a href="Ruiz%20v.%20Estelle">Ruiz v. Estelle</a>" (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> enacted the <a href="Prison%20Litigation%20Reform%20Act">Prison Litigation Reform Act</a> (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.

The ACLU, during the 1960s and 1970s, expanded its scope to include what it referred to as "victim groups", namely women, the poor, and <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>s. Heeding the call of female members, the ACLU endorsed the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> in 1970 and created the Women's Rights Project in 1971. The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the <a href="National%20Organization%20for%20Women">National Organization for Women</a>, including breakthrough cases such as "<a href="Reed%20v.%20Reed">Reed v. Reed</a>", "<a href="Frontiero%20v.%20Richardson">Frontiero v. Richardson</a>", and " <a href="Taylor%20v.%20Louisiana">Taylor v. Louisiana</a>".

ACLU leader <a href="Harriet%20Pilpel">Harriet Pilpel</a> raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">gay rights</a>. In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher. The U.S. District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for "immorality" was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher. The court refused to reinstate the teacher, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a 2 to 1 vote. "Burton v. Cascade School District", 353 F. Supp. 254 (D. Or. 1972), aff'd 512 F.2d 850 (1975). In 1973 the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project (later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project) which combated discrimination against homosexuals. This support continues even today. After then-Senator <a href="Larry%20Craig">Larry Craig</a> was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights.

Rights of the poor was another area that was expanded by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU played a key role in the 1968 "<a href="King%20v.%20Smith">King v. Smith</a>" decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.

The Reproductive Freedom Project is an institution founded in 1974 (within the larger context of ACLU) that is committed to defend individuals who feel abused by the government, especially with cases pertaining to a lack of access to abortions, birth control, or sexual education.

The ACLU continues to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly treated by the government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group to stand up for an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when they are not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.

The Reproductive Freedom Project of ACLU, according to their mission statement, actively works provide access to any and all reproductive health care for any human, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or political standing. In some cases, Reproductive Freedom Programs fund ultrasounds and abortions and any lodging, meals, or transportation that go with that. Because women have reported finding it necessary to cross state lines or wait weeks for an abortion, The Reproductive Freedom Project states that they want to fight for individuals "state by state and law by law" until every individual can pursue the kind of lifestyle they want. As stated on their website, "states have enacted more restrictions to abortion than they did in the previous 10 years combined". The ACLU claims to be committed to fighting injustices with access to education on what accessibilities one has to <a href="abortion">abortion</a>s, <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a>, <a href="Freedom%20of%20religion">religious rights</a>, as well as trying to diminish abstinence-only <a href="Sex%20education">sexual education</a>, for ACLU claims that abstinence only education promotes a lack of willingness to use contraceptives.

As referenced in the larger ACLU article, in 1929, the ACLU defended <a href="Margaret%20Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>'s right to educate the general public about forms of birth control. In 1980, the Project filed Poe v. Lynchburg Training School after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated Walker v. Pierce, the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981-1990, the Project litigated <a href="Hodgson%20v.%20Minnesota">Hodgson v. Minnesota</a>, a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not to comply with a state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and <a href="HIV/AIDS">AIDS</a>. In 1995, the Project filed Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth, the U.S.'s first <a href="condom">condom</a> availability program.

The Reproductive Freedom Project is presently working on three ideas: (1) to "reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country" (2) to "block state and federal welfare "reform" proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare, unmarried women, or teenagers" and (3) to "stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks. The Project says they are hoping to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation.

The <a href="Privacy%20laws%20of%20the%20United%20States">right to privacy</a> is not explicitly identified in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 "<a href="Poe%20v.%20Ullman">Poe v. Ullman</a>" case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in "<a href="Griswold%20v.%20Connecticut">Griswold v. Connecticut</a>" (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a right to privacy. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate <a href="Opposition%20to%20the%20legalization%20of%20abortion">anti-abortion laws</a> starting in 1964, a year before "Griswold" was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the <a href="Support%20for%20the%20legalization%20of%20abortion">right to abortion</a> as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Vuitch">United States v. Vuitch</a>" which expanded the right of physicians to determine when <a href="abortion">abortion</a>s were necessary. These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>", which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on <a href="interracial%20marriage">interracial marriage</a>, in the case of "<a href="Loving%20v.%20Virginia">Loving v. Virginia</a>" (1967).

Related to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 <a href="Fair%20Credit%20Reporting%20Act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 <a href="Family%20Educational%20Rights%20and%20Privacy%20Act">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act</a>, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.

In the early 1970s, conservatives and libertarians began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal. Legal scholar Joseph W. Bishop wrote that the ACLU's trend to partisanship started with its defense of Dr. Spock's anti-war protests. Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace <a href="judicial%20activism">judicial activism</a>. Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>" and "<a href="Griswold%20v.%20Connecticut">Griswold v. Connecticut</a>" violated the <a href="Original%20intent">intention of the authors</a> of the Bill of Rights. The ACLU became an issue in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201988">1988 presidential campaign</a>, when Republican candidate <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> accused Democratic candidate <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> (a member of the ACLU) of being a "card carrying member of the ACLU".

It is the policy of the ACLU to support the civil liberties of defendants regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, <a href="George%20Lincoln%20Rockwell">George Lincoln Rockwell</a>, and <a href="KKK">KKK</a> members. The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.

In 1977, a small group of American Nazis, led by <a href="Frank%20Collin">Frank Collin</a>, applied to the town of <a href="Skokie%2C%20Illinois">Skokie, Illinois</a> for permission to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camp">Nazi concentration camp</a>s. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration. Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court. The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in "Smith v. Collin", 447 F.Supp. 676.

The Skokie case was heavily publicized across America, partially because Jewish groups such as the <a href="Jewish%20Defense%20League">Jewish Defense League</a> and <a href="Anti%20Defamation%20League">Anti Defamation League</a> strenuously objected to the demonstration, leading many members of the ACLU to cancel their memberships. The Illinois affiliate of the ACLU lost about 25% of its membership and nearly one-third of its budget. The financial strain from the controversy led to layoffs at local chapters. After the membership crisis died down, the ACLU sent out a fund-raising appeal which explained their rationale for the Skokie case, and raised over $500,000 ($ in dollars).

The <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">inauguration</a> of <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> as president in 1981, ushered in an <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">eight-year period of conservative leadership</a> in the U.S. government. Under his leadership, the government pushed a conservative social agenda, including outlawing abortion, inserting prayer in schools, banning pornography, and resisting gay rights.

Fifty years after the <a href="Scopes%20trial">Scopes trial</a>, the ACLU found itself fighting another classroom case, the <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> 1981 creationism statute, which required schools to teach the biblical account of creation as a scientific alternative to evolution. The ACLU won the case in the "<a href="McLean%20v.%20Arkansas">McLean v. Arkansas</a>" decision.

In 1982, the ACLU became involved in a case involving the distribution of <a href="child%20pornography">child pornography</a> ("<a href="New%20York%20v.%20Ferber">New York v. Ferber</a>"). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the <a href="three%20prong%20obscenity%20test">three prong obscenity test</a> should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.

During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201988">1988 presidential election</a>, <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> noted that his opponent <a href="Governor%20of%20Massachusetts">Massachusetts Governor</a> <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> had described himself as a "card-carrying member of the ACLU" and used that as evidence that Dukakis was "a strong, passionate liberal" and "out of the mainstream". The phrase subsequently was used by the organization in an advertising campaign.

In 1990 the ACLU defended Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Oliver%20North">Oliver North</a>, whose conviction was tainted by coerced testimonya violation of his <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">fifth amendment rights</a>during the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Contra%20affair">Iran–Contra affair</a>, where Oliver North was involved in illegal weapons sales to Iran in order to illegally fund the <a href="Contras">Contra guerillas</a>.

In 1997, ruling unanimously in the case of "<a href="Reno%20v.%20American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union</a>", the Supreme Court voted down anti-<a href="indecency">indecency</a> provisions of the <a href="Communications%20Decency%20Act">Communications Decency Act</a> (the CDA), finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's "use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other and just what they mean."

In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, stated that proposed anti-<a href="Spamming">spam</a> legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing spam to be labeled as such, "Standardized labeling is compelled speech." He also stated, "It's relatively simple to click and delete." The debate found the ACLU joining with the <a href="Direct%20Marketing%20Association%20%28USA%29">Direct Marketing Association</a> and the <a href="Center%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Technology">Center for Democracy and Technology</a> in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported "<a href="opt-out">opt-out</a>" requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 <a href="CAN-SPAM%20Act%20of%202003">CAN-SPAM</a> act suggesting that it could have a <a href="Chilling%20effect%20%28term%29">chilling effect</a> on speech in cyberspace. It has been criticized for this position.

In November 2000, 15 African-American residents of <a href="Hearne%2C%20Texas">Hearne, Texas</a>, were indicted on drug charges after being arrested in a series of "drug sweeps". The ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit, "<a href="Kelly%20v.%20Paschall">Kelly v. Paschall</a>", on their behalf, alleging that the arrests were unlawful. The ACLU contended that 15 percent of Hearne's male African-American population aged 18 to 34 were arrested based only on the "uncorroborated word of a single unreliable confidential informant coerced by police to make cases." On May 11, 2005, the ACLU and <a href="Robertson%20County%2C%20Texas">Robertson County</a> announced a confidential settlement of the lawsuit, an outcome which "both sides stated that they were satisfied with." The District Attorney dismissed the charges against the plaintiffs of the suit. The 2009 film "<a href="American%20Violet">American Violet</a>" depicts this case.

In 2000, the ACLU's Massachusetts affiliate represented the <a href="North%20American%20Man%20Boy%20Love%20Association">North American Man Boy Love Association</a> (NAMBLA), on first amendment grounds, in the "<a href="Curley%20v.%20NAMBLA">Curley v. NAMBLA</a>" wrongful death civil suit. The organization was sued because a man who raped and murdered a child had visited the NAMBLA website. Also in 2000, the ACLU lost the "<a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%20v.%20Dale">Boy Scouts of America v. Dale</a>" case, which had asked the Supreme Court to require the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> to drop their policy of prohibiting homosexuals from becoming Boy Scout leaders.

In March 2004, the ACLU, along with <a href="Lambda%20Legal">Lambda Legal</a> and the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Lesbian%20Rights">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a>, sued the state of California on behalf of six same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, "Woo v. Lockyer", was eventually consolidated into "<a href="In%20re%20Marriage%20Cases">In re Marriage Cases</a>", the <a href="California%20Supreme%20Court">California Supreme Court</a> case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008 until <a href="California%20Proposition%208%20%282008%29">Proposition 8</a> was passed on November 4, 2008.

During the 2004 trial regarding allegations of <a href="Rush%20Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>'s drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy should not have been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the <a href="Dover%20Area%20School%20District">school district</a> in <a href="Dover%2C%20Pennsylvania">Dover, Pennsylvania</a>, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> is not fact and mentioning <a href="intelligent%20design">intelligent design</a> as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the <a href="Establishment%20Clause">Establishment Clause</a> of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. The ACLU, joined by <a href="Americans%20United%20for%20Separation%20of%20Church%20and%20State">Americans United for Separation of Church and State</a>, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge <a href="John%20E.%20Jones%20III">John E. Jones III</a> ruled in favor of the parents in the "<a href="Kitzmiller%20v.%20Dover%20Area%20School%20District">Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District</a>" decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.

In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU sued the City of Los Angeles, on behalf of Robert Lee Purrie and five other homeless people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting <a href="due%20process">due process</a> and <a href="equal%20protection">equal protection</a>, and prohibiting <a href="cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment">cruel and unusual punishment</a>). The Court ruled in favor of the ACLU, stating that, "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:30 am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets for the first time in months.

In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State joined with a pro-gun rights organization, the <a href="Second%20Amendment%20Foundation">Second Amendment Foundation</a>, and prevailed in a lawsuit against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to <a href="Google%20Images">Google Images</a>.

In 2006, the ACLU challenged a Missouri law that prohibited picketing outside of veterans' funerals. The suit was filed in support of the <a href="Westboro%20Baptist%20Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a> and <a href="Shirley%20Phelps-Roper">Shirley Phelps-Roper</a>, who were threatened with arrest. The Westboro Baptist Church is well known for their picket signs that contain messages such as, "God Hates Fags", "Thank God for Dead Soldiers" and "Thank God for 9/11". The ACLU issued a statement calling the legislation a "law that infringes on Shirley Phelps-Roper's rights to religious liberty and free speech". The ACLU prevailed in the lawsuit. In 2008, the ACLU was part of a consortium of legal advocates, including <a href="Lambda%20Legal">Lambda Legal</a> and the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Lesbian%20Rights">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a>, that challenged California's <a href="California%20Proposition%208%20%282008%29">Proposition 8</a>, which declared <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>s illegal. The ACLU and its allies prevailed.

In light of the Supreme Court's "<a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20v.%20Heller">Heller</a>" decision recognizing that the Constitution protects an individual right to bear arms, ACLU of Nevada took a position of supporting "the individual's right to bear arms subject to constitutionally permissible regulations" and pledged to "defend this right as it defends other constitutional rights". Since 2008, the ACLU has increasingly assisted gun owners recover firearms that have been seized illegally by law enforcement.

In 2009, the ACLU filed an <a href="amicus%20brief">amicus brief</a> in "<a href="Citizens%20United%20v.%20FEC">Citizens United v. FEC</a>", arguing that the <a href="Bipartisan%20Campaign%20Reform%20Act">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act</a> of 2002 violated the First Amendment right to free speech by curtailing political speech. This stance on the landmark "Citizens United" case caused considerable disagreement within the organization, resulting in a discussion about its future stance during a quarterly board meeting in 2010. On March 27, 2012, the ACLU reaffirmed its stance in support of the Supreme Court's "Citizens United" ruling, at the same time voicing support for expanded public financing of election campaigns and stating the organization would firmly oppose any future constitutional amendment limiting free speech.

In 2010 the ACLU of Illinois was inducted into the <a href="Chicago%20Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame</a> as a Friend of the Community.

In 2011 the ACLU started its <a href="Don%27t%20Filter%20Me">Don't Filter Me</a> project, countering <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a>-related <a href="Internet%20censorship">Internet censorship</a> in <a href="State%20school%23United%20States">public schools</a> in the United States.

On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in "<a href="Collins%20v.%20United%20States">Collins v. United States</a>" that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under "<a href="don%27t%20ask%2C%20don%27t%20tell">don't ask, don't tell</a>" since November 10, 2004, who had previously been granted only half that. Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.

After the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, the federal government instituted a broad range of new measures to combat <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a>, including the passage of the <a href="Patriot%20Act">Patriot Act</a>. The ACLU challenged many of the measures, claiming that they violated rights regarding <a href="due%20process">due process</a>, privacy, illegal searches, and <a href="cruel%20and%20unusual%20punishment">cruel and unusual punishment</a>. An ACLU policy statement states:

Our way forward lies in decisively turning our backs on the policies and practices that violate our greatest strength: our Constitution and the commitment it embodies to the rule of law. Liberty and security do not compete in a zero-sum game; our freedoms are the very foundation of our strength and security. The ACLU's National Security Project advocates for national security policies that are consistent with the Constitution, the rule of law, and fundamental human rights. The Project litigates cases relating to detention, torture, discrimination, surveillance, censorship, and secrecy.

During the ensuing debate regarding the proper balance of civil liberties and security, the membership of the ACLU increased by 20%, bringing the group's total enrollment to 330,000. The growth continued, and by August 2008 ACLU membership was greater than 500,000. It remained at that level through 2011.

The ACLU has been a vocal opponent of the <a href="USA%20PATRIOT%20Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a> of 2001, the <a href="Domestic%20Security%20Enhancement%20Act%20of%202003">PATRIOT 2</a> Act of 2003, and associated legislation made in response to the threat of domestic terrorism. In response to a requirement of the USA PATRIOT Act, the ACLU withdrew from the <a href="Combined%20Federal%20Campaign">Combined Federal Campaign</a> charity drive. The campaign imposed a requirement that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list. The ACLU has stated that it would "reject $500,000 in contributions from private individuals rather than submit to a government 'blacklist' policy."

In 2004, the ACLU sued the federal government in "<a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union%20v.%20Ashcroft">American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft</a>" on behalf of <a href="Nicholas%20Merrill">Nicholas Merrill</a>, owner of an <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet service provider</a>. Under the provisions of the Patriot Act, the government had issued <a href="national%20security%20letter">national security letter</a>s to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a <a href="gag%20order">gag order</a> on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.

In January 2006, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, "<a href="ACLU%20v.%20NSA">ACLU v. NSA</a>", in a federal district court in Michigan, challenging government spying in the <a href="NSA%20warrantless%20surveillance%20controversy">NSA warrantless surveillance controversy</a>. On August 17, 2006, that court ruled that the warrantless wiretapping program is unconstitutional and ordered it ended immediately. However, the order was stayed pending an appeal. The <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">Bush</a> administration did suspend the program while the appeal was being heard. In February 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down an appeal from the ACLU to let it pursue a lawsuit against the program that began shortly after the September 11 terror attacks.

The ACLU and other organizations also filed separate lawsuits around the country against telecommunications companies. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in Illinois ("Terkel v. AT&T") which was dismissed because of the <a href="state%20secrets%20privilege">state secrets privilege</a> and two others in California requesting injunctions against <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> and <a href="Verizon%20Communications">Verizon</a>. On August 10, 2006, the lawsuits against the telecommunications companies were transferred to a federal judge in San Francisco.

The ACLU represents a <a href="Muslim-American">Muslim-American</a> who was detained but never accused of a crime in "<a href="Ashcroft%20v.%20al-Kidd">Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</a>", a civil suit against former Attorney General <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a>. In January 2010, the <a href="American%20military">American military</a> released the names of 645 detainees held at the <a href="Bagram%20Theater%20Internment%20Facility">Bagram Theater Internment Facility</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by a <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a> lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.

The ACLU has also criticized <a href="targeted%20killing">targeted killing</a>s of American citizens who fight against the United States. In 2011 the ACLU criticized the killing of radical Muslim cleric <a href="Anwar%20al-Awlaki">Anwar al-Awlaki</a> on the basis that it was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right to not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

Following <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Donald Trump</a>'s election as President on November 8, 2016, the ACLU responded on Twitter saying: "Should President-elect Donald Trump attempt to implement his unconstitutional campaign promises, we'll see him in court." On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an <a href="Executive%20Order%2013769">executive order</a> indefinitely barring "Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, refugees or otherwise, from entering the United States for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen". The ACLU responded by filing a lawsuit against the ban on behalf of Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who had been detained at JFK International Airport. On January 28, 2017, a US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly granted a temporary injunction against the immigration order, saying it was difficult to see any harm from allowing the newly arrived immigrants from entering the country.
In response to Trump's order, the ACLU raised more than $24 million from more than 350,000 individual online donations in a two-day period. This amounted to six times what the ACLU normally receives in online donations in a year. Celebrities donating included <a href="Chris%20Sacca">Chris Sacca</a> (who offered to match other people's donations and ultimately gave $150,000), <a href="Rosie%20O%27Donnell">Rosie O'Donnell</a>, <a href="Judd%20Apatow">Judd Apatow</a>, <a href="Sia%20Furler">Sia</a>, <a href="John%20Legend">John Legend</a>, and <a href="Adele">Adele</a>. The number of members of the ACLU doubled in the time from the election to end of January to 1 million.

The ACLU of Tennessee protested the <a href="shooting%20of%20Jocques%20Clemmons">shooting of Jocques Clemmons</a> which occurred in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> on February 10, 2017. On May 11, 2017, as Glenn Funk, the district attorney of <a href="Davidson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Davidson County</a>, decided not to prosecute police officer Joshua Lippert, they called for an independent community review board and for Nashville police officers to wear body cameras.

Adobe Systems

Adobe Systems Incorporated ( ) is an American multinational computer software company. The company is headquartered in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a>, California, United States. Adobe has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards <a href="rich%20Internet%20application">rich Internet application</a> <a href="software%20development">software development</a>. It is best known for <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a>, an image editing software, <a href="Acrobat%20Reader">Acrobat Reader</a>, the <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">Portable Document Format</a> (PDF) and <a href="Adobe%20Creative%20Suite">Adobe Creative Suite</a>, as well as its successor <a href="Adobe%20Creative%20Cloud">Adobe Creative Cloud</a>.

Adobe was founded in December 1982 by <a href="John%20Warnock">John Warnock</a> and <a href="Charles%20Geschke">Charles Geschke</a>, who established the company after leaving <a href="Xerox%20PARC">Xerox PARC</a> in order to develop and sell the <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a> <a href="page%20description%20language">page description language</a>. In 1985, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Computer</a> licensed PostScript for use in its <a href="LaserWriter">LaserWriter</a> <a href="computer%20printer">printers</a>, which helped spark the <a href="desktop%20publishing">desktop publishing</a> revolution.

, Adobe Systems has about 15,000 employees worldwide, about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in <a href="Newton%2C%20Massachusetts">Newton</a>, Massachusetts; <a href="New%20York%20City%2C%20New%20York">New York City</a>, New York; <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, Minnesota; <a href="Lehi%2C%20Utah">Lehi</a>, Utah; <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington; <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and <a href="San%20Luis%20Obispo%2C%20California">San Luis Obispo</a>, California in the United States.

The company was started in John Warnock's garage. The name of the company, "Adobe", comes from <a href="Adobe%20Creek%20%28Santa%20Clara%20County%2C%20California%29">Adobe Creek</a> in <a href="Los%20Altos%2C%20California">Los Altos</a>, California, which ran behind Warnock's house. Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized "A" and was designed by the wife of <a href="John%20Warnock">John Warnock</a>, Marva Warnock, who is a graphic designer.

Steve Jobs asked to buy the company for five million dollars in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company, for which Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.

Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software, and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.

PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988. Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100). By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.

Warnock described the language as "extensible", in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.

Adobe's first products after <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a> were <a href="digital%20font">digital font</a>s, which they released in a proprietary format called <a href="Type%201%20font">Type 1</a>. <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> subsequently developed a competing standard, <a href="TrueType">TrueType</a>, which provided full scalability and precise control of the <a href="pixel">pixel</a> pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>.

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer <a href="Computer%20software">software</a> market with <a href="Adobe%20Illustrator">Illustrator</a>, a <a href="vector%20graphics">vector</a>-based drawing program for the <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.

Adobe Systems entered <a href="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012. Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November. For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its <a href="flagship">flagship</a> product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Photoshop</a>. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.

In 1993, Adobe introduced <a href="PDF">PDF</a>, the Portable Document Format, and its <a href="Adobe%20acrobat">Adobe Acrobat and Reader</a> software. PDF is now an International Standard: <a href="PDF">ISO 32000-1:2008</a>.

In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as <a href="Adobe%20Premiere%20Pro">Adobe Premiere Pro</a> in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired <a href="Aldus">Aldus</a> and added <a href="Adobe%20PageMaker">PageMaker</a> and <a href="Adobe%20After%20Effects">After Effects</a> to its product line later in the year; it also controls the <a href="TIFF">TIFF</a> file format. In the same year, Adobe acquired LaserTools Corp and Compution Inc. In 1995, Adobe added <a href="Adobe%20FrameMaker">FrameMaker</a>, the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added <a href="Ares">Ares</a> Software Corp. In 2002, Adobe acquired Canadian company Accelio (also known as <a href="JetForm">JetForm</a>).
On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, <a href="Macromedia">Macromedia</a>, in a <a href="stock%20swap">stock swap</a> valued at about $3.4 billion, adding <a href="Adobe%20ColdFusion">ColdFusion</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Contribute">Contribute</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Captivate">Captivate</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Acrobat%20Connect">Acrobat Connect</a> (formerly Macromedia Breeze), <a href="Adobe%20Director">Director</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Dreamweaver">Dreamweaver</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Fireworks">Fireworks</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a>, <a href="FlashPaper">FlashPaper</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Flex">Flex</a>, <a href="Adobe%20FreeHand">FreeHand</a>, <a href="Adobe%20HomeSite">HomeSite</a>, <a href="Adobe%20JRun">JRun</a>, <a href="Adobe%20Presenter">Presenter</a>, and <a href="Adobe%20Authorware">Authorware</a> to Adobe's product line.

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008. On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, <a href="Adobe%20GoLive">GoLive</a> in favor of <a href="Adobe%20Dreamweaver">Dreamweaver</a>. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched <a href="Acrobat.com">Acrobat.com</a>, a series of <a href="web%20application">web application</a>s geared for collaborative work. Creative Suite 4, which includes Design, Web, Production Premium and Master Collection came out in October 2008 in six configurations at prices from about USD $1,700 to $2,500 or by individual application. The Windows version of Photoshop includes 64-bit processing. On December 3, 2008, Adobe laid off 600 of its employees (8% of the worldwide staff) citing the <a href="Late%202000s%20recession">weak economic environment</a>.

On November 10, 2009, the company laid off a further 680 employees. Adobe announced it was investigating a "<a href="Operation%20Aurora">coordinated attack</a>" against corporate network systems in China, managed by the company.

Adobe's 2010 was marked by continuing front-and-back arguments with Apple over the latter's non-support for Adobe Flash on its iPhone, iPad and other products. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs claimed that Flash was not reliable or secure enough, while Adobe executives have argued that Apple wish to maintain control over the iOS platform. In April 2010, Steve Jobs published a post titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he outlined his thoughts on <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> and the rise of <a href="HTML%205">HTML 5</a>.
In July 2010, Adobe bought <a href="Day%20Software">Day Software</a> integrating their line of CQ Products: WCM, DAM, SOCO, and Mobile

In January 2011, Adobe acquired DemDex, Inc. with the intent of adding DemDex's audience-optimization software to its online marketing suite. At Photoshop World 2011, Adobe unveiled a new mobile photo service. Carousel is a new application for iPhone, iPad and Mac that uses Photoshop Lightroom technology for users to adjust and fine-tune images on all platforms. Carousel will also allow users to automatically sync, share and browse photos. The service was later renamed to "Adobe Revel".

In October 2011, Adobe acquired Nitobi Software, the makers of the <a href="mobile%20application">mobile application</a> development framework "PhoneGap". As part of the acquisition, the source code of PhoneGap was submitted to the <a href="Apache%20Foundation">Apache Foundation</a>, where it became <a href="Apache%20Cordova">Apache Cordova</a>.

On November 9, 2011, Adobe announced that they would cease development of Flash for mobile devices following version 11.1. Instead it would focus on HTML 5 for mobile devices. On December 1, 2011, Adobe announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held <a href="Efficient%20Frontier%20%28company%29">Efficient Frontier</a>.

In December 2012, Adobe opened a new 280,000 square foot corporate campus in <a href="Lehi%2C%20Utah">Lehi, Utah</a>.
In 2013, Adobe Systems endured a major security breach. Vast portions of the source code for the company's software were stolen and posted online and over 150 million records of Adobe's customers have been made readily available for download. In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe.

A <a href="class-action%20lawsuit">class-action lawsuit</a> alleging that the company suppressed employee compensation was <a href="High-Tech%20Employee%20Antitrust%20Litigation">filed against Adobe</a>, and three other <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>-based companies in a <a href="California">California</a> federal district court in 2013. In May 2014, it was revealed the four companies, Adobe, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>, <a href="Google">Google</a>, and <a href="Intel">Intel</a> had reached agreement with the plaintiffs, 64,000 employees of the four companies, to pay a sum of $324.5 million to settle the suit.

Fotolia by Adobe – a <a href="microstock">microstock</a> agency that presently provides over 57 million high-resolution, royalty-free images and videos available to license (via subscription or credit purchase methods). On December 11, 2014, Adobe announced it was buying Fotolia for $800 million in cash, aiming at integrating the service to its Creative Cloud solution. The purchase was completed in January 2015. It is run as a stand-alone website.

Since 1995, "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" has ranked Adobe as an outstanding place to work. Adobe was rated the 5th best U.S. company to work for in 2003, 6th in 2004, 31st in 2007, 40th in 2008, 11th in 2009, 42nd in 2010, 65th in 2011, 41st in 2012, and 83rd in 2013.
In 2015, Adobe Systems India was ranked 21st of great places to work in India. In June 2014, it was ranked 6th of great places to work in India., In October 2008, Adobe Systems Canada Inc. was named one of "<a href="Canada%27s%20Top%20100%20Employers">Canada's Top 100 Employers</a>" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" newsmagazine.

Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices, with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries. As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.

After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers, a petition to protest over "unfair pricing" was published and signed by 10,000 users. In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar, and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.

Adobe's <a href="Adobe%20Reader">Reader</a> and <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> were listed on "The 10 most hated programs of all time" on <a href="TechRadar.com">TechRadar.com</a>.

Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers. Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see <a href="Flash%20player%23Criticism">criticism of Flash Player</a>). A report by security researchers from <a href="Kaspersky%20Lab">Kaspersky Lab</a> criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.

Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including <a href="spyware">spyware</a> in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named <a href="Omniture">Omniture</a>. When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: "could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account". When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade. Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.

Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Flash</a> update process, and for pushing a third-party <a href="scareware">scareware</a> program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.

On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information. Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts. The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though <a href="data%20privacy">data</a> <a href="privacy%20law">privacy law</a>s in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.

A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org. <a href="LastPass">LastPass</a>, a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not <a href="Salt%20%28cryptography%29">salted</a> them. Another security firm, <a href="Sophos">Sophos</a>, showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort. According to an <a href="Information%20technology">IT</a> expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.

Many of the credit cards were tied to the <a href="Creative%20Cloud">Creative Cloud</a> software-by-subscription service. Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers. When a <a href="data%20breach">data breach</a> occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.

After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's <a href="source%20code">source code</a> repository, likely in mid-August 2013. Because <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hackers</a> acquired copies of the source code of Adobe <a href="proprietary%20software">proprietary</a> products, they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned. Security researcher <a href="Alex%20Holden">Alex Holden</a>, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected <a href="Adobe%20Acrobat">Acrobat</a>, <a href="ColdFusion">ColdFusion</a> and numerous other applications, as "one of the worst in US history". Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a>, which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.

Published on a server of a Russian-speaking <a href="hacker%20group">hacker group</a>, the "disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data" and may have opened the gateway to new generation <a href="zero-day%20attack">zero-day attack</a>s. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of <a href="PR%20Newswire">PR Newswire</a>'s customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach. They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.

Adobe acquired Aldus Corp. in 1994, a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product. <a href="Adobe%20Freehand">Freehand</a> was direct competition to <a href="Adobe%20Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor. The <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004). Altsys was then bought by <a href="Macromedia">Macromedia</a>, which released versions 5 to 11. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of <a href="Adobe%20FreeHand">Freehand</a> in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete. With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.

In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner "Free Freehand", and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe. The suit alleged that "Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market" and that "Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe’s Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism." Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled. The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.

As of 2010, on its FreeHand product page Adobe stated ""While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista."" As of 2016, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.

Alexander Technique

The Alexander Technique (A.T.), named after <a href="Frederick%20Matthias%20Alexander">Frederick Matthias Alexander</a>, is an educational process that attempts to develop the ability to avoid unnecessary muscular tension by retraining physical movement reactions. Alexander believed the individual's spatial <a href="self-awareness">self-awareness</a> was related to psychological conditioning; questionably trained foundation habits of posture can be unsuitably added into procedural skills. Alexander observed that those whose goals justified it necessary to have trained themselves to overcompensate could not trust their judgment of physical orientation and required effort, (their "sensory appreciation.").

Alexander developed his technique's principles in the 1890s in an attempt to address voice loss during public speaking, from unintentionally retaining childhood asthma breathing problems. He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in <a href="Shakespearean">Shakespearean</a> theater.

Some proponents of the Alexander Technique observe that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative action. However, , the sparse supporting medical evidence was of moderate quality and overall, the effectiveness of the Alexander Technique is uncertain because of insufficient evidence and that it relies on education and sustained use by the patient. There is evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique is so far helpful for long-term back pain, long-term neck pain, and may help people cope with <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>.

Frederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955) was a Shakespearean <a href="orator">orator</a> who developed voice loss during his unamplified performances. After doctors found no physical cause, Alexander reasoned that he was inadvertently damaging himself while speaking. He observed himself in multiple mirrors and saw that he was contracting his posture prior to in preparation for any <a href="phonation">phonation</a>. He hypothesized that a habitual conditioned pattern (of pulling his head backwards and downwards) needlessly was disrupting the normal working of his total postural, breathing, and vocal processes.

With experimentation, Alexander developed the ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, displacement of his head, and shortening of his stature. As he solved issues about how to do what he imagined was possible, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss were resolved. While on a recital tour in New Zealand (1895) he began to understand the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning. Further, Alexander observed that many individuals commonly tightened their <a href="musculature">musculature</a> in the similar pattern as he had done, in anticipation of many other activities besides speech.

Alexander believed his work could be applied to improve talent. He further refined his method of self-observation and re-training to teach his discoveries to others. As part of his teaching method, he also developed a form of guided modeling, that imparted the improved kinesthetic and proprioceptive experience to his students. This approach to showing the student what he meant also allowed him to re-arrange the working of a person's entire supportive musculature as it functions in relation to gravity from moment to moment. He explained his reasoning and answers in four books published in 1918, 1923, 1931 (1932 in the UK) and 1942.

He also trained teachers to teach his work and to use their hands in this unique way from 1930 until his death in 1955. Teacher training was continued during World War II between 1941 and 1943, when Alexander accompanied children and teachers of the Little School to Stow, Massachusetts to join his brother, A. R. Alexander. The American teacher training course included Frank Pierce Jones, who went on to conduct scientific research work to explore aspects of the Alexander Technique at the Tufts Institute for Psychological Research. Jones published many of his studies in professional journals.

Since the 1960s, training schools for teachers of the Alexander Technique were begun in the United States and world-wide. Most were based upon the standards of training laid down by the Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique that was established in England after Alexander's death in 1955. Quality of training time usually requires 1600 hours of daily teaching experience, because of the challenges of surpassing conditioning. All "Alexander teachers" who have the support of their peers are deemed equally qualified, despite differing training methods, because they all agree on F.M. Alexander's principles. 

The American philosopher and educator <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a> became impressed with the Alexander Technique after his headaches, neck pains, blurred vision, and stress symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's advice to change his posture. In 1923, Dewey wrote the introduction to Alexander's "Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual".

<a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> had transformative lessons with Alexander, and continued doing so with other teachers after moving to the US. He rated Alexander's work highly enough to base the character of the doctor who saves the protagonist in '<a href="Eyeless%20in%20Gaza%20%28novel%29">Eyeless in Gaza</a>' (an experimental form of autobiographical work) on F.M. Alexander, putting many of his phrases into the character's mouth. Huxley's work 'The Art of Seeing' also discusses his views on the technique.

Sir <a href="Stafford%20Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a>, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a> and other stage grandees, <a href="Victor%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a> and other eminent people of the era also wrote positive appreciations of his work after taking lessons with Alexander.

Since Alexander's work in the field came at the start of the 20th century, his ideas influenced many originators in the field of mind-body improvement. <a href="Fritz%20Perls">Fritz Perls</a>, who originated <a href="Gestalt%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Btherapy">Gestalt therapy</a>, credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work. The <a href="Mitzvah%20Technique">Mitzvah Technique</a> was influenced by the Alexander Technique; as was the <a href="Feldenkrais%20Method">Feldenkrais Method</a> - who expanded on the one exercise in Alexander Technique called "The Whispered Ah."

Alexander's approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action, (which could be now called '<a href="Mindfulness">mindful</a>' action, though in his four books he did not use that term.) 

Actions such as sitting, <a href="Squatting%20position">squatting</a>, lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student that is tailored to their interests or work activities: hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or artistic performance or practice, sports, speech or horseback riding. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment-to-moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with a highly skilled light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the student into a more coordinated state in movement and at rest during in-person lessons. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific, as everyone starts out with slightly different habits.

Exercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a "correct" position. There are only two specific procedures that are practiced by the student; the first is lying <a href="Supine%20position%23Semi-supine">semi-supine</a>. Resting in this way uses "mechanical advantage" as a means of redirecting long-term and short-term accumulated muscular tension into a more integrated and balanced state. This position is sometimes referred to as "constructive rest", or "the balanced resting state". It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of <a href="conscious">conscious</a> "directing" without "doing". The second exercise is the "Whispered Ah", which is used to co-ordinate freer breathing and vocal production.

Freedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual conclusions about the nature of training and experimentation. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient, or not in keeping with best "use" of themselves as a whole. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.

This specialized hands-on skill also allows Alexander teachers to bring about a balanced working of the student's supportive musculature as it relates to gravity's downward pull from moment to moment. Often, students require a great deal of hands-on work in order to first gain an experience of a fully poised relation to gravity and themselves. The hands-on skill requires Alexander teachers to maintain in themselves from moment-to-moment their own improved psycho-physical co-ordination that the teacher is <a href="communicating">communicating</a> to the student.

Alexander developed terminology to describe his methods, outlined in his four books that explain the experience of learning and substituting new improvements.





"Directing" serves to counteract the common backward and downward pull and shortening in stature that can be detected at the beginning of every movement - particularly addressing a startle pattern of "fight, flight or freeze." A mere thought, as a projection of intention, shapes preparatory movement below the level of sensing it. Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: "The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen." Some teachers have shortened this to a suggestion of, "Freer?" Negative directions (that use Alexander's other preventive principle of "inhibition") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.
Whichever is used, all "Directing" is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to "Directing" often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. 
Teacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.


The Alexander Technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons. Its advocates state that it allows for a balanced use of all aspects of the vocal tract by consciously increasing air-flow, allowing improved vocal skill and tone. The method is said by actors to reduce <a href="stage%20fright">stage fright</a> and to increase spontaneity.

The Alexander Technique is a frequent component in acting training, because it allows actors to assume the mannerisms of different characters. 

According to Alexander Technique instructor <a href="Michael%20J.%20Gelb">Michael J. Gelb</a>, people tend to study the Alexander Technique for reasons of personal development.

The Alexander Technique is most commonly taught privately in a series of 10 to 40 private lessons which may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Students are often performers, such as actors, dancers, musicians, athletes and public speakers, or people who work on computers, or who are in frequent pain for other reasons. Instructors observe their students, then show them how to move with better poise and less strain. Sessions include chair work and table work, often in front of a mirror, during which the instructor and the student will stand, sit and lie down, moving efficiently while maintaining a comfortable relationship between the head, neck and spine.

To qualify as a teacher of Alexander Technique, instructors are required to complete 1,600 hours, spanning three years, of supervised teacher training. The result must be satisfactory to qualified peers to gain membership in professional societies.

Some advocates for the Alexander technique have claimed it can help people with many kinds of health conditions. 

One example is a claim that it can benefit people with <a href="asthma">asthma</a>. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review found that there is no conclusive evidence that the Alexander technique is effective for treating asthma, and randomized clinical trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this type of treatment approach. 

A review by <a href="Aetna">Aetna</a> last updated in 2016 stated: "Aetna considers the following alternative medicine interventions experimental and investigational, because there is inadequate evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature of their effectiveness." Included is Alexander technique in that list.

A review published in 2015 and conducted for the Australia Department of Health in order to determine what services the Australian government should pay for, reviewed clinical trials published to date and found that: "Overall, the evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the intervention arms, wide confidence intervals or a lack of replication of results." It concluded that: "The Alexander technique may improve short-term pain and disability in people with low back pain, but the longer-term effects remain uncertain. For all other clinical conditions, the effectiveness of Alexander technique was deemed to be uncertain, due to insufficient evidence." It also noted that: "Evidence for the safety of
Alexander technique was lacking, with most trials not reporting on this outcome. 

A review of evidence for Alexander Technique for various health conditions provided by UK <a href="National_Health_Service_%28England%29%23Internet_information_service">NHS Choices</a> last updated in July 2015 found that:
There's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with:

"NHS Choices" also states that "some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed. There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress."

A review published in "<a href="BioMed_Central%23Journals">BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a>" in 2014 focused on "the evidence for the effectiveness of AT sessions on musicians' performance, anxiety, respiratory function and posture" concluded that: "Evidence from RCTs and CTs suggests that AT sessions may improve performance anxiety in musicians. Effects on music performance, respiratory function and posture yet remain inconclusive."

A review published in the "<a href="International%20Journal%20of%20Clinical%20Practice">International Journal of Clinical Practice</a>" in 2012 found: "Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in Parkinson’s-associated disability. Preliminary evidence suggests that Alexander Technique lessons may lead to improvements in balance skills in the elderly, in general chronic pain, posture, respiratory function and stuttering, but there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations in these areas."

Apparent magnitude

The apparent magnitude () of a <a href="celestial%20object">celestial object</a> is a number that is a measure of its <a href="brightness">brightness</a> as seen by an observer on Earth. The brighter an object appears, the lower its <a href="Magnitude%20%28astronomy%29">magnitude</a> value (i.e. inverse relation). The Sun, at apparent magnitude of −27, is the brightest object in the sky. It is adjusted to the value it would have in the absence of the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. Furthermore, the magnitude scale is <a href="logarithmic%20scale">logarithmic</a>; a difference of one in magnitude corresponds to a change in brightness by a factor of , or about 2.512.

The measurement of apparent magnitudes or brightnesses of celestial objects is known as <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a>. Apparent magnitudes are used to quantify the brightness of sources at <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <a href="Visible%20spectrum">visible</a>, and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths. An apparent magnitude is usually measured in a specific <a href="passband">passband</a> corresponding to some <a href="photometric%20system">photometric system</a> such as the <a href="UBV%20photometric%20system">UBV system</a>. In standard astronomical notation, an apparent magnitude in the V ("visual") filter band would be denoted either as "m" or often simply as "V", as in ""m" = 15" or ""V" = 15" to describe a 15th-magnitude object.

The scale used to indicate magnitude originates in the <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic</a> practice of dividing stars visible to the naked eye into six "magnitudes". The <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest stars</a> in the night sky were said to be of <a href="first%20magnitude%20star">first magnitude</a> ( = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ( = 6), which is the limit of <a href="human">human</a> <a href="visual%20perception">visual perception</a> (without the aid of a <a href="telescope">telescope</a>). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a <a href="logarithmic%20scale">logarithmic scale</a>), although that ratio was subjective as no <a href="photodetector">photodetector</a>s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> in his "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", and is generally believed to have originated with <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a>.

In 1856, <a href="Norman%20Robert%20Pogson">Norman Robert Pogson</a> formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the <a href="logarithmic%20scale">logarithmic scale</a> still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude is 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude . This figure, the <a href="Generalized%20continued%20fraction%23Example%202">fifth root of 100</a>, became known as Pogson's Ratio. The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a> a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to <a href="Vega">Vega</a> as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.

Apart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and <a href="Infrared%23ISO%2020473%20scheme">near infrared</a> wavelengths, where its <a href="spectral%20energy%20distribution">spectral energy distribution</a> (SED) closely approximates that of a <a href="black%20body">black body</a> for a temperature of . However, with the advent of <a href="infrared%20astronomy">infrared astronomy</a> it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an <a href="Infrared%20excess">Infrared excess</a> presumably due to a <a href="circumstellar%20disk">circumstellar disk</a> consisting of <a href="Cosmic%20dust">dust</a> at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to "all" wavelengths on the basis of the <a href="Planck%27s%20law">black body radiation curve</a> for an ideal stellar surface at uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the <a href="spectral%20irradiance">spectral irradiance</a> (usually expressed in <a href="jansky">jansky</a>s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength can be computed. Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared; of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29%23methods">photometry</a> over various wavelength bands.

With the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as bright planets such as Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by "negative" magnitudes. For example, <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, the brightest star of the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, has an apparent magnitude of −1.4 in the visible; negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the <a href="%23Table%20of%20notable%20celestial%20objects">table</a> below.

Astronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the <a href="AB%20magnitude">AB magnitude</a> system, in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant <a href="Spectral%20flux%20density">flux per unit frequency interval</a>, rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.

As the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced by transmission through the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, any measurement of apparent magnitude is <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29%23Calibrations">corrected</a> for what it would have been as seen from above the atmosphere. The dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its apparent magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the apparent magnitude , in the <a href="Photometric%20system">spectral band</a> , would be given by

which is more commonly expressed in terms of <a href="Common%20logarithm">common (base-10) logarithms</a> as

where is the observed <a href="flux">flux</a> using spectral filter , and is the reference flux (zero-point) for that <a href="Photometric%20system%23Filters%20used">photometric filter</a>. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor ≈ 2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference implies a brightness factor of

"What is the ratio in brightness between the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and the full <a href="Moon">Moon</a>?"

The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean apparent magnitude of the full moon is −12.74 (dimmer).

Difference in magnitude: 

Brightness factor: 

The Sun appears about times brighter than the full moon.

Sometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, <a href="Photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a> on closely separated <a href="double%20star">double star</a>s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.

Solving for formula_7 yields

where is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by and .

Since flux decreases with distance according to the <a href="inverse-square%20law">inverse-square law</a>, a particular apparent magnitude could equally well refer to a star at one distance, or a star four times brighter at twice that distance, and so on. When one is not interested in the brightness as viewed from Earth, but the "intrinsic" brightness of an astronomical object, then one refers not to the apparent magnitude but the <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a>. The absolute magnitude , of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of 10 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s (about 32.6 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s). The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (yellow) and 5.48 in the B band (blue). In the case of a planet or asteroid, the absolute magnitude rather means the apparent magnitude it would have if it were 1 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a> from both the observer and the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and fully illuminated (a geometrically impossible configuration).

It is important to note that the scale is <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>ic: the relative brightness of two objects is determined by the difference of their magnitudes. For example, a difference of 3.2 means that one object is about 19 times as bright as the other, because <a href="Apparent%20magnitude%23History">Pogson's Ratio</a> raised to the power 3.2 is approximately 19.05.

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the <a href="human%20eye">human eye</a> itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see <a href="Weber%E2%80%93Fechner%20law">Weber–Fechner law</a>), but it is now believed that the response is a <a href="power%20law">power law</a> (see <a href="Stevens%27%20power%20law">Stevens' power law</a>).

Magnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not <a href="monochromatic">monochromatic</a>. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the <a href="UBV%20system">UBV system</a> is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350 nm, in the near <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>), B (about 435 nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555 nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the light-adapted human eye, and when an apparent magnitude is given without any further qualification, it is usually the V magnitude that is meant, more or less the same as visual magnitude.

Because cooler stars, such as <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s and <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some <a href="stellar%20classification">L and T class</a> stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in <a href="infrared">infrared</a>.

Measures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) <a href="photographic%20film">photographic film</a>, the relative brightnesses of the blue <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> and the red supergiant <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as <a href="photographic%20magnitude">photographic magnitude</a>s, and are now considered obsolete.

For objects within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> with a given <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a>, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be <a href="K%20correction">adjusted for redshifts</a> and for <a href="Non-Euclidean%20geometry">non-Euclidean</a> distance measures due to <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>.

For planets and other Solar System bodies the apparent magnitude is derived from its <a href="Phase%20curve%20%28astronomy%29">phase curve</a> and the distances to the Sun and observer.
Some of the above magnitudes are only approximate. Telescope sensitivity also depends on observing time, optical bandpass, and interfering light from <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">scattering</a> and <a href="airglow">airglow</a>.

Absolute magnitude

Absolute magnitude is a measure of the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of a <a href="celestial%20object">celestial object</a>, on a <a href="Logarithmic%20scale">logarithmic</a> <a href="Magnitude%20%28astronomy%29">astronomical magnitude</a> scale. An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> that the object would have if were viewed from a distance of exactly 10 <a href="parsecs">parsecs</a> (32.6 <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s), with no <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">extinction</a> (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by <a href="Cosmic%20dust">interstellar dust</a> particles. By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale. As with all astronomical <a href="magnitude%20%28astronomy%29">magnitudes</a>, the absolute magnitude can be specified for different <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> ranges corresponding to specified <a href="Filter%20%28optics%29">filter</a> bands or <a href="passband">passband</a>s; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the absolute visual magnitude, which uses the visual (V) band of the spectrum (in the <a href="UBV%20photometric%20system">UBV photometric system</a>). Absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital M, with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement, such as M for absolute magnitude in the V band.

The more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude. A difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities, and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100. For example, a star of absolute magnitude M=3 would be 100 times more luminous than a star of absolute magnitude M=8 as measured in the V filter band. The <a href="Sun">Sun</a> has absolute magnitude M=+4.83. Highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes: for example, the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy has an absolute B magnitude of about −20.8.

An object's absolute bolometric magnitude represents its total <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> over all <a href="wavelengths">wavelengths</a>, rather than in a single filter band, as expressed on a logarithmic magnitude scale. To convert from an absolute magnitude in a specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude, a <a href="bolometric%20correction">bolometric correction</a> is applied.

For <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> bodies that shine in reflected light, a different definition of absolute magnitude (H) is used, based on a standard reference distance of one <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>.

In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light years, 308.57 petameters or 308.57 <a href="Orders%20of%20magnitude%20%28numbers%29%231012">trillion</a> kilometres). A star at 10 parsecs has a <a href="parallax">parallax</a> of 0.1″ (100 milli<a href="minute%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a>). Galaxies (and other <a href="nebula">extended objects</a>) are much larger than 10 parsecs, their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky, and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances, but the same convention is used. A galaxy's magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object, treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source, and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance. Consequently, the absolute magnitude of any object "equals" the apparent magnitude it "would have" if it were 10 parsecs away.

The measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called a <a href="bolometer">bolometer</a>. When using an absolute magnitude, one must specify the type of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> being measured. When referring to total energy output, the proper term is <a href="bolometer">bolometric</a> magnitude. The bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus a <a href="bolometric%20correction">bolometric correction</a>, . This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see <a href="Planck%27s%20law">Planck's law</a>).

All stars visible to the naked eye have such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the <a href="planet">planet</a>s and cast shadows if they were at 10 parsecs from the Earth. Examples include <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> (−7.0), <a href="Deneb">Deneb</a> (−7.2), <a href="Zeta%20Puppis">Naos</a> (−6.0), and <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> (−5.6). For comparison, <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> has an absolute magnitude of 1.4, which is brighter than the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, whose absolute visual magnitude is <a href="fifth%20magnitude%20star">4.83</a> (it actually serves as a reference point). The Sun's absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily, usually at 4.75.
Absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from −10 to +17. The absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower (brighter). For example, the giant <a href="elliptical%20galaxy%20M87">elliptical galaxy M87</a> has an absolute magnitude of −22 (i.e. as bright as about 60,000 stars of magnitude −10).

The Greek astronomer Hipparchus established a numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appeared in the sky. The brightest stars in the sky were assigned an apparent magnitude , and the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are assigned . The difference between them corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness. For objects within the Milky Way, the absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude from any distance (in <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s) is related by:

where is the radiant flux measured at distance (in parsecs), the radiant flux measured at distance . The relation can be written in terms of logarithm:

where the insignificance of <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">extinction by gas and dust</a> is assumed. Typical extinction rates within the galaxy are 1 to 2 magnitudes per kiloparsec, when <a href="Dark%20nebula">dark clouds</a> are taken into account.

For objects at very large distances (outside the Milky Way) the luminosity distance must be used instead of (in parsecs), because the Euclidean approximation is invalid for distant objects and <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> must be taken into account. Moreover, the <a href="cosmological%20redshift">cosmological redshift</a> complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude, because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum. To compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects, a <a href="K%20correction">K correction</a> might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects.

The absolute magnitude can also be approximated using apparent magnitude and <a href="stellar%20parallax">stellar parallax</a> :

or using apparent magnitude and <a href="distance%20modulus">distance modulus</a> :

<a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> has a visual magnitude of 0.12 and distance about 860 light-years

<a href="Vega">Vega</a> has a parallax of 0.129″, and an apparent magnitude of 0.03

<a href="Alpha%20Centauri%20A">Alpha Centauri A</a> has a parallax of 0.742″ and an apparent magnitude of −0.01

The <a href="Black%20Eye%20Galaxy">Black Eye Galaxy</a> has a visual magnitude of 9.36 and a distance modulus of 31.06

The <a href="Bolometer">bolometric</a> magnitude , takes into account <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> at all <a href="wavelengths">wavelengths</a>. It includes those unobserved due to instrumental <a href="Passband">pass-band</a>, the Earth's atmospheric absorption, and <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">extinction by interstellar dust</a>. It is defined based on the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of the stars. In the case of stars with few observations, it must be computed assuming an <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a>.

Classically, the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to:

which makes by inversion:

where

In August 2015, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> passed Resolution B2 defining the zero points of the absolute and apparent <a href="bolometric%20magnitude">bolometric magnitude</a> scales in SI units for power (<a href="watt">watt</a>s) and irradiance (W/m), respectively. Although bolometric magnitudes had been used by astronomers for many decades, there had been systematic differences in the absolute magnitude-luminosity scales presented in various astronomical references, and no international standardization. This led to systematic differences in bolometric corrections scales, which when combined with incorrect assumed absolute bolometric magnitudes for the Sun could lead to systematic errors in estimated stellar luminosities (and stellar properties calculated which rely on stellar luminosity, such as radii, ages, and so on).

Resolution B2 defines an absolute bolometric magnitude scale where corresponds to luminosity , with the zero point <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> set such that the Sun (with nominal <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> ) corresponds to absolute <a href="bolometric%20magnitude">bolometric magnitude</a> 4.74. Placing a <a href="radiation">radiation</a> source (e.g. star) at the standard distance of 10 <a href="parsecs">parsecs</a>, it follows that the zero point of the apparent <a href="bolometric%20magnitude">bolometric magnitude</a> scale corresponds to <a href="irradiance">irradiance</a> . Using the IAU 2015 scale, the nominal total <a href="solar%20irradiance">solar irradiance</a> ("<a href="solar%20constant">solar constant</a>") measured at 1 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a> () corresponds to an apparent <a href="bolometric%20magnitude">bolometric magnitude</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> of −26.832.

Following Resolution B2, the relation between a star's absolute bolometric magnitude and its luminosity is no longer directly tied to the Sun's (variable) luminosity:

where

The new IAU absolute magnitude scale permanently disconnects the scale from the variable Sun. However, on this SI power scale, the nominal solar luminosity corresponds closely to 4.74, a value that was commonly adopted by astronomers before the 2015 IAU resolution.

The luminosity of the star in watts can be calculated as a function of its absolute bolometric magnitude as:

using the variables as defined previously.

For <a href="planet">planet</a>s and <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s a definition of absolute magnitude that is more meaningful for non-stellar objects is used.

In this case, the absolute magnitude () is defined as the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> that the object would have if it were one <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a> (AU) from both the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and the observer, and in conditions of ideal solar opposition. In fact, one has to take into account that Solar System bodies are illuminated by the Sun, therefore the magnitude varies as a function of illumination conditions, described by the <a href="phase%20angle%20%28astronomy%29">phase angle</a>. This relationship is referred to as the <a href="Phase%20curve%20%28astronomy%29">phase curve</a>. The absolute magnitude 
is defined for the ideal case of phase angle equal to zero.

To convert a stellar or galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57. A comet's nuclear magnitude () is a different scale and can not be used for a size comparison with an asteroid's () magnitude.

The absolute magnitude "H" can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.
where is 1 AU, is the <a href="phase%20angle%20%28astronomy%29">phase angle</a>, the angle between the body-Sun and body–observer lines. By the <a href="law%20of%20cosines">law of cosines</a>, we have:

Apollo 1

Apollo 1, initially designated AS-204, was the first manned mission of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>, which had as its ultimate goal a manned lunar landing. The <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>al test of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> never made its target launch date of February 21, 1967. A cabin fire during a launch rehearsal test on January 27 at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34</a> killed all three crew members—Command Pilot <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Virgil I. "Gus" Grissom</a>, Senior Pilot <a href="Edward%20Higgins%20White">Edward H. White II</a>, and Pilot <a href="Roger%20B.%20Chaffee">Roger B. Chaffee</a>—and destroyed the Command Module (CM). The name "Apollo 1", chosen by the crew, was officially retired by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> in commemoration of them on April 24, 1967.

Immediately after the fire, NASA convened the "Apollo 204 Accident Review Board" to determine the cause of the fire, and both houses of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> conducted their own <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20hearing">committee inquiries</a> to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the <a href="plug%20door">plug door</a> hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.

During the Congressional investigation, then-Senator <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a> publicly revealed a NASA internal document citing problems with prime Apollo contractor <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a>, which became known as the "<a href="Phillips%20Report">Phillips Report</a>". This disclosure embarrassed NASA Administrator <a href="James%20E.%20Webb">James E. Webb</a>, who was unaware of the document's existence, and attracted controversy to the Apollo program. Despite congressional displeasure at NASA's lack of openness, both congressional committees ruled that the issues raised in the report had no bearing on the accident.

Manned Apollo flights were suspended for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, the development and unmanned testing of the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) and <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> Moon rocket continued. The <a href="Saturn%20IB">Saturn IB</a> launch vehicle for Apollo 1, AS-204, was used for the first LM test flight, <a href="Apollo%205">Apollo 5</a>. The first successful manned Apollo mission was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> in October 1968.

AS-204 was to be the first manned test flight of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) to Earth orbit, launched on a Saturn IB rocket. AS-204 was to test launch operations, ground tracking and control facilities and the performance of the Apollo-Saturn launch assembly and would have lasted up to two weeks, depending on how the <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> performed.

The CSM for this flight, number 012 built by <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> (NAA), was a <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Development%20history">Block I</a> version designed before the <a href="lunar%20orbit%20rendezvous">lunar orbit rendezvous</a> landing strategy was chosen; therefore it lacked capability of docking with the Lunar Module. This was incorporated into the Block II CSM design, along with lessons learned in Block I. Block II would be test-flown with the LM when the latter was ready, and would be used on the <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a> flights.

Director of Flight Crew Operations <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> selected the first Apollo crew in January 1966, with Grissom as Command Pilot, White as Senior Pilot, and rookie <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn F. Eisele</a> as Pilot. But Eisele dislocated his shoulder twice aboard the <a href="reduced%20gravity%20aircraft">KC135 weightlessness training aircraft</a>, and had to undergo surgery on January 27. Slayton replaced him with Chaffee, and NASA announced the crew selection on March 21, 1966. <a href="James%20McDivitt">James McDivitt</a>, <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> and <a href="Rusty%20Schweickart">Russell Schweickart</a> were named as the backup crew.

On September 29, <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Walter Schirra</a>, Eisele, and <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a> were named as the prime crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an unmanned test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.

In March, NASA was studying the possibility of flying the first Apollo mission as a joint <a href="space%20rendezvous">space rendezvous</a> with the final <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a> mission, <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini 12</a> in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.

Grissom declared his intent to keep his craft in orbit for a full 14 days. A newspaper article published on August 4, 1966, referred to the flight as "Apollo 1". CM-012 arrived at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on August 26, labeled "Apollo One" by NAA on its packaging.

In October 1966, NASA announced the flight would carry a small television camera to broadcast live from the Command Module. The camera would also be used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft's instrument panel in flight. Television cameras were carried aboard all manned Apollo missions.

Grissom's crew received approval in June 1966 to design a mission patch with the name "Apollo 1". The design's center depicts a Command/Service Module flying over the southeastern United States with Florida (the launch point) prominent. The <a href="Moon">Moon</a> is seen in the distance, symbolic of the eventual program goal. A yellow border carries the mission and astronaut names with another border set with stars and stripes, trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by the crew, with the artwork done by North American Aviation employee Allen Stevens.

The Apollo Command/Service Module was much bigger and far more complex than any previously implemented spacecraft design. In October 1963, <a href="Joseph%20Francis%20Shea">Joseph F. Shea</a> was named Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) manager, responsible for managing the design and construction of both the CSM and the LM.
In a spacecraft review meeting held with Shea on August 19, 1966 (a week before delivery), the crew expressed concern about the amount of flammable material (mainly nylon netting and <a href="hook%20and%20loop%20fastener">Velcro</a>) in the cabin, which both astronauts and technicians found convenient for holding tools and equipment in place. Though Shea gave the spacecraft a passing grade, after the meeting they gave him a crew portrait they had posed with heads bowed and hands clasped in prayer, with the inscription:
It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go over your head.
Shea gave his staff orders to tell North American to remove the flammables from the cabin, but did not supervise the issue personally.

North American shipped spacecraft CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to be completed at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with the inability of the training simulator engineers to keep up with the spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.

The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC altitude chamber in September, and combined system testing was performed. Altitude testing was performed first unmanned, then with both the prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module was found to have a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.
In December, the second Block I flight AS-205 was canceled as unnecessary; and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the backup crew for Apollo 1. McDivitt's crew was now promoted to prime crew of the Block II / LM mission, re-designated AS-258 because the AS-205 launch vehicle would be used in place of AS-207. A third manned mission was planned to launch the CSM and LM together on a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> (AS-503) to an elliptical <a href="medium%20Earth%20orbit">medium Earth orbit</a> (MEO), to be crewed by <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>, <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> and <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a>. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart had started their training for AS-258 in CM-101 at the NAA plant in Downey, California, when the Apollo 1 accident occurred.

Once all outstanding CSM-012 hardware problems were fixed, the reassembled spacecraft finally completed a successful altitude chamber test with Schirra's backup crew on December 30. According to the final report of the accident investigation board, "At the post-test debriefing the backup flight crew expressed their satisfaction with the condition and performance of the spacecraft." This would appear to contradict the account given in "<a href="Lost%20Moon">Lost Moon</a>: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13" by <a href="Jeffrey%20Kluger">Jeffrey Kluger</a> and astronaut <a href="Jim%20Lovell">James Lovell</a>, that "When the trio climbed out of the ship, … Schirra made it clear that he was not pleased with what he had seen," and that he later warned Grissom and Shea that "there's nothing wrong with this ship that I can point to, but it just makes me uncomfortable. Something about it just doesn't ring right," and that Grissom should get out at the first sign of trouble.

Following the successful altitude tests, the spacecraft was removed from the altitude chamber on January 3, 1967, and mated to its Saturn IB launch vehicle on <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">pad 34</a> on January 6.

The launch simulation on January 27, 1967, on pad 34, was a "plugs-out" test to determine whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on (simulated) internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or <a href="cryogenics">cryogenics</a>, and all <a href="pyrotechnic%20fastener">pyrotechnic</a> systems (explosive bolts) were disabled.

At 1:00 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> (1800 <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a>) on January 27, first Grissom, then Chaffee, and White entered the Command Module fully pressure-suited, and were strapped into their seats and hooked up to the spacecraft's oxygen and communication systems. Grissom immediately noticed a strange odor in the air circulating through his suit which he compared to "sour buttermilk", and the simulated countdown was held at 1:20 pm, while air samples were taken. No cause of the odor could be found, and the countdown was resumed at 2:42 pm. The accident investigation found this odor not to be related to the fire.

Three minutes after the count was resumed, the hatch installation was started. The hatch consisted of three parts: a removable inner hatch, which stayed inside the cabin; a hinged outer hatch, which was part of the spacecraft's heat shield; and an outer hatch cover, which was part of the boost protective cover enveloping the entire Command Module to protect it from aerodynamic heating during launch, and from launch escape rocket exhaust in the event of a launch abort. The boost hatch cover was partially, but not fully, latched in place because the flexible boost protective cover was slightly distorted by some cabling run under it to provide the simulated internal power. (The spacecraft's fuel cell reactants were not loaded for this test.) After the hatches were sealed, the air in the cabin was replaced with pure oxygen at , higher than atmospheric pressure.
Movement by the astronauts was detected by the spacecraft's <a href="inertial%20measurement%20unit">inertial measurement unit</a> and the astronaut's biomedical sensors, and also indicated by increases in oxygen spacesuit flow, and sounds from Grissom's stuck-open microphone. There was no evidence to identify the movement, or whether it was related to the fire. The stuck microphone was part of a problem with the communications loop connecting the crew, the <a href="Operations%20and%20Checkout%20Building">Operations and Checkout Building</a>, and the Complex 34 blockhouse control room. The poor communications led Grissom to remark: "How are we going to get to the Moon if we can't talk between two or three buildings?" The simulated countdown was held again at 5:40 pm while attempts were made to troubleshoot the communications problem. All countdown functions up to the simulated internal power transfer had been successfully completed by 6:20 pm, but at 6:30 the count remained on hold at T minus 10 minutes.

The crew members were using the time to run through their checklist again, when a momentary increase in AC Bus 2 voltage occurred. Nine seconds later (at 6:31:04.7), one of the astronauts (some listeners and laboratory analysis indicate Grissom) exclaimed "Hey!" or "Fire!"; this was followed by two seconds of scuffling sounds through Grissom's open microphone. This was immediately followed at 6:31:06.2 (23:31:06.2 GMT) by someone (believed by most listeners, and supported by laboratory analysis, to be Chaffee) saying, "[I've, or We've] got a fire in the cockpit." After 6.8 seconds of silence, a second, badly garbled transmission occurred, interpreted by various listeners as:
This transmission, believed by some listeners to be White, lasted 5.0 seconds and ended with a cry of pain.

Some blockhouse witnesses said that they saw White on the television monitors, reaching for the inner hatch release handle as flames in the cabin spread from left to right.

The intensity of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.

As the pressure was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began when most of the oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.

It took five minutes for the pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner hatch to the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed it out of the way to one side. Although the cabin lights remained lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.

As a result of the in-flight failure of the <a href="Gemini%208">Gemini 8</a> mission on March 17, 1966, NASA Deputy Administrator <a href="Robert%20Seamans">Robert Seamans</a> wrote and implemented "Management Instruction 8621.1" on April 14, 1966, defining "Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures". This modified NASA's existing accident procedures, based on military aircraft accident investigation, by giving the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures, beyond those for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared, "It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations."

Immediately after the Apollo 1 fire, to avoid appearance of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator <a href="James%20E.%20Webb">James E. Webb</a> asked <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> to allow NASA to handle the investigation according to its established procedure, promising to be truthful in assessing blame, and to keep the appropriate leaders of Congress informed. Seamans then directed establishment of the "Apollo 204 Review Board" chaired by <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a> director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut <a href="Frank%20Borman">Frank Borman</a>, spacecraft designer <a href="Maxime%20Faget">Maxime Faget</a>, and six others. On February 1, Cornell University professor Frank A. Long left the board, and was replaced by Dr. Robert W. Van Dolah, of the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">U.S. Bureau of Mines</a>. The next day, North American's Chief engineer for Apollo, George Jeffs, also left.

Seamans immediately ordered all Apollo 1 hardware and software impounded, to be released only under control of the board. After thorough <a href="stereoscopy">stereo photographic</a> documentation of the CM-012 interior, the board ordered its disassembly using procedures tested by disassembling the identical CM-014, and conducted a thorough investigation of every part. The board also reviewed the astronauts' autopsy results and interviewed witnesses. Seamans sent Webb weekly status reports of the investigation's progress, and the board issued its final report on April 5, 1967.

According to the Board, Grissom suffered severe <a href="burn">third degree burns</a> on over one-third of his body and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on almost half of his body and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over almost a quarter of his body and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a> caused by high concentrations of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. <a href="Asphyxiation">Asphyxiation</a> happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.

The review board identified several major factors which combined to cause the fire and the astronauts' deaths:

The review board determined that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several <a href="electric%20arc">electric arc</a>s in the interior equipment. They were unable to conclusively identify a single ignition source. They determined that the fire most likely started near the floor in the lower left section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.

The board noted that a silver-plated copper wire, running through an environmental control unit near the center couch, had become stripped of its <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Teflon</a> insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door.

This weak point in the wiring also ran near a junction in an <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a>/water cooling line that had been prone to leaks. The <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of ethylene glycol solution with the silver <a href="anode">anode</a> was discovered at MSC on May 29, 1967 to be a hazard capable of causing a violent <a href="exothermic%20reaction">exothermic reaction</a>, igniting the ethylene glycol mixture in the CM's pure oxygen atmosphere. Experiments at the <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> confirmed the hazard existed for silver-plated wires, but not for copper-only or nickel-plated copper. In July, ASPO directed both North American and Grumman to ensure no silver or silver-coated electrical contacts existed in the vicinity of possible glycol spills in the Apollo spacecraft.

The plugs-out test had been run to simulate the launch procedure, with the cabin pressurized with pure oxygen at the nominal launch level of , above standard sea level atmospheric pressure. This is more than five times the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, and provides an environment in which materials not normally considered highly flammable will burst into flame.

The high-pressure oxygen atmosphere was consistent with that that had been used successfully in the <a href="Project%20Mercury">Mercury</a> and Gemini programs. The pressure before launch was deliberately greater than ambient in order to drive out the nitrogen-containing air and replace it with pure oxygen, and also to seal the <a href="plug%20door">plug door</a> hatch cover. During launch, the pressure would have been gradually reduced to the in-flight level of , providing sufficient oxygen for the astronauts to breathe while reducing the fire risk. The Apollo 1 crew had successfully tested this procedure with their spacecraft in the Operations and Checkout Building altitude (vacuum) chamber on October 18 and 19, 1966, and the backup crew of Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham had repeated it on December 30. The investigation board noted that, during these tests, the Command Module had been fully pressurized with pure oxygen four times, for a total of six hours and fifteen minutes, two and a half hours longer than it had been during the plugs-out test.

The review board cited "many types and classes of combustible material" close to ignition sources. The NASA crew systems department had installed of Velcro throughout the spacecraft, almost like carpeting. This Velcro was found to be flammable in a high-pressure 100% oxygen environment. Astronaut <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> states in his book "Men From Earth" that the flammable material had been removed per the crew's August 19 complaints and Joseph Shea's order, but was replaced before the August 26 delivery to Cape Kennedy.

The inner hatch cover used a <a href="plug%20door">plug door</a> design, sealed by higher pressure inside the cabin than outside. The normal pressure level used for launch ( above ambient) created sufficient force to prevent removing the cover until the excess pressure was vented. Emergency procedure called for Grissom to open the cabin vent valve first, allowing White to remove the cover, but Grissom was prevented from doing this because the valve was located to the left, behind the initial wall of flames. Also, while the system could easily vent the normal pressure, its flow capacity was utterly incapable of handling the rapid increase to absolute caused by the intense heat of the fire.

North American had originally suggested the hatch open outward and use <a href="explosive%20bolt">explosive bolt</a>s to blow the hatch in case of emergency, as had been done in <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's "<a href="Mercury-Redstone%204%23Liberty%20Bell%207">Liberty Bell 7</a>" flight, so the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> designers rejected the explosive design in favor of a mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Donald K. Slayton</a>'s testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks and at the end of flight, rather than for emergency exit.

The board noted that: the test planners had failed to identify the test as hazardous; the emergency equipment (such as gas masks) were inadequate to handle this type of fire; that fire, rescue, and medical teams were not in attendance; and that the spacecraft work and access areas contained many hindrances to emergency response such as steps, sliding doors, and sharp turns.

When designing the Mercury spacecraft, NASA had considered using a nitrogen/oxygen mixture to reduce the fire risk near launch, but rejected it based on two considerations. First, nitrogen used with the in-flight pressure reduction carried the risk of <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a> (known as "the bends"). But the decision to eliminate the use of any gas but oxygen was crystalized when a serious accident occurred on April 21, 1960, in which <a href="McDonnell%20Aircraft">McDonnell Aircraft</a> test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin / spacesuit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber. The problem was found to be nitrogen-rich (oxygen-poor) air leaking from the cabin into his spacesuit feed. North American Aviation had suggested using an oxygen/nitrogen mixture for Apollo, but NASA overruled this. The pure oxygen design was judged to be safer, less complicated, and lighter in weight.

In his monograph "Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions", Deputy Administrator Seamans wrote that NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment was not to run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary series "NASA: Triumph and Tragedy", Jim McDivitt said that NASA had no idea how a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film <a href="In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28film%29">"In the Shadow of the Moon"</a>.

Several fires in high-oxygen test environments had occurred before the Apollo fire. In 1962, <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> Colonel B. Dean Smith was conducting a test of the <a href="Gemini%20space%20suit">Gemini space suit</a> with a colleague in a pure oxygen chamber at <a href="Brooks%20Air%20Force%20Base">Brooks Air Force Base</a> in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, Texas when a fire broke out, destroying the chamber. Smith and his partner narrowly escaped.

Other oxygen fire occurrences are documented in reports archived in the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a>, such as:

Incidents had also occurred in the <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet space program</a>, but due to the government's policy of secrecy, these were not disclosed until well after the Apollo 1 fire. <a href="Cosmonaut">Cosmonaut</a> <a href="Valentin%20Bondarenko">Valentin Bondarenko</a> died on March 23, 1961, from burns sustained in a fire while participating in a 15-day endurance experiment in a high-oxygen isolation chamber, less than three weeks before the first <a href="Vostok%20programme">Vostok</a> manned space flight; this was disclosed on January 28, 1986.

During the <a href="Voskhod%202">Voskhod 2</a> mission in March 1965, cosmonauts <a href="Pavel%20Belyayev">Pavel Belyayev</a> and <a href="Alexey%20Leonov">Alexey Leonov</a> could not completely seal the spacecraft hatch after Leonov's historic first <a href="extravehicular%20activity">walk in space</a>. The spacecraft's environmental control system responded to the leaking air by adding more oxygen to the cabin, causing the concentration level to rise as high as 45%. The crew and ground controllers worried about the possibility of fire, remembering Bondarenko's death four years earlier.

Committees in both houses of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> with oversight of the space program soon launched investigations, including the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Aeronautical%20and%20Space%20Sciences">Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences</a>, chaired by Senator <a href="Clinton%20Presba%20Anderson">Clinton P. Anderson</a>. Seamans, Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Dr. <a href="George%20Mueller%20%28NASA%29">George E. Mueller</a>, and Apollo Program Director <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj Gen</a> <a href="Samuel%20C.%20Phillips">Samuel C. Phillips</a> were called to testify before Anderson's committee.

In the February 27 hearing, <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter F. Mondale</a> asked Webb if he knew of a report of extraordinary problems with the performance of North American Aviation on the Apollo contract. Webb replied he did not, and deferred to his subordinates on the witness panel. Mueller and Phillips responded they too were unaware of any such "report".

However, in late 1965, just over a year before the accident, Phillips had headed a "<a href="tiger%20team">tiger team</a>" investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage (for which North American was also prime contractor). He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to Mueller and Seamans, and also presented them in a memo to North American president <a href="John%20Leland%20Atwood">John L. Atwood</a>, to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded memo to Atwood.

During Mondale's 1967 questioning about what was to become known as the "<a href="Phillips%20Report">Phillips Report</a>", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; perhaps this was what Mondale's information referred to. Mondale continued to refer to "the Report" despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such, and angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, he questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.

On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending NASA's November 1961 selection of North American as the prime contractor for Apollo. This was followed on June 9 by Seamans filing a seven-page memorandum documenting the selection process. Webb eventually provided a <a href="document%20control">controlled copy</a> of Phillips' memo to Congress. The Senate committee noted in its final report NASA's testimony that "the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident", but stated in its recommendations:
Notwithstanding that in NASA's judgment the contractor later made significant progress in overcoming the problems, the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations to the attention of the committee.

Freshman Senators <a href="Edward%20Brooke">Edward W. Brooke III</a> and <a href="Charles%20H.%20Percy">Charles H. Percy</a> jointly wrote an "Additional Views" section appended to the committee report, chastising NASA more strongly than Anderson for not having disclosed the Phillips review to Congress. Mondale wrote his own, even more strongly worded Additional View, accusing NASA of "evasiveness, … lack of candor, … patronizing attitude toward Congress, … refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate Congressional inquiries, and … solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy."

The potential political threat to Apollo blew over, due in large part to the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who at the time still wielded a measure of influence with the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.

Relations between NASA and North American deteriorated over assignment of blame. North American argued unsuccessfully it was not responsible for the fatal error in spacecraft atmosphere design. Finally, Webb contacted Atwood, and demanded either he or Chief Engineer <a href="Harrison%20Storms">Harrison A. Storms</a> resign. Atwood elected to fire Storms.

On the NASA side, Joseph Shea resorted to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope. NASA administrator James Webb became increasingly worried about Shea's mental state. Shea was asked to take an extended voluntary leave of absence, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness. This approach to remove Shea from his position was also unsuccessful. Finally, six months after the fire, Shea's superiors reassigned him to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Shea felt that his new post was a "non-job," and left after only two months.

<a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a> called a meeting of his staff in Mission Control three days after the accident, delivering a speech which has subsequently become one of NASA's principles. Speaking of the errors and overall attitude surrounding the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a> before the accident, he stated: "We were too '<a href="gung-ho">gung-ho</a>' about the schedule and we blocked out all of the problems we saw each day in our work. Every element of the program was in trouble and so were we." He reminded the team of the perils and mercilessness of their endeavor, and stated the new requirement that every member of every team in mission control be "tough and competent", requiring nothing less than perfection throughout NASA's programs. In 2003, following the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">Space Shuttle "Columbia" disaster</a>, NASA administrator <a href="Sean%20O%27Keefe">Sean O'Keefe</a> quoted Kranz's speech, applying it to the "Columbia" crew.

After the fire, the Apollo program was grounded for review and redesign. The Command Module was found to be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).

It was decided that remaining Block I spacecraft would be used only for unmanned Saturn V test flights. All manned missions would use the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Major%20differences%20between%20Block%20I%20and%20Block%20II">Block II spacecraft</a>, to which many Command Module design changes were made:

Thorough protocols were implemented for documenting spacecraft construction and maintenance.

The astronauts' widows asked that "Apollo 1" be reserved for the flight their husbands never made, and on April 24, 1967, Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, Dr. George E. Mueller, announced this change officially: AS-204 would be recorded as Apollo 1, "first manned Apollo Saturn flight – failed on ground test". Even though three unmanned Apollo missions (<a href="AS-201">AS-201</a>, <a href="AS-202">AS-202</a>, and <a href="AS-203">AS-203</a>) had previously occurred, only AS-201 and AS-202 carried spacecraft. Therefore, the next mission, the first unmanned Saturn V test flight (AS-501) would be designated <a href="Apollo%204">Apollo 4</a>, with all subsequent flights numbered sequentially in the order flown. The first three flights would not be renumbered, and the names "Apollo 2" and "Apollo 3" would officially go unused. Dr. Mueller considered AS-201 and AS-202, the first and second flights of the Apollo Block I CSM, as Apollo 2 and 3 respectively.

The manned flight hiatus allowed work to catch up on the Saturn V and Lunar Module, which were encountering their own delays. Apollo 4 flew in November 1967. Apollo 1's (AS-204) Saturn IB rocket was taken down from Launch Complex 34, later reassembled at <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Space%20Launch%20Complex%2037">Launch complex 37B</a> and used to launch <a href="Apollo%205">Apollo 5</a>, an unmanned Earth orbital test flight of the first Lunar Module LM-1, in January 1968. A second unmanned Saturn V AS-502 flew as <a href="Apollo%206">Apollo 6</a> in April 1968, and Grissom's backup crew of <a href="Wally%20Schirra">Wally Schirra</a>, <a href="Don%20Eisele">Don Eisele</a>, and <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a>, finally flew the orbital test mission as <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> (AS-205), in a Block II CSM in October 1968.

Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee were buried at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>. Ed White was buried at <a href="West%20Point%20Cemetery">West Point Cemetery</a> on the grounds of the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>. Their names are among those of several astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty, listed on the <a href="Space%20Mirror%20Memorial">Space Mirror Memorial</a> at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Visitor%20Complex">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</a> in <a href="Merritt%20Island%2C%20Florida">Merritt Island, Florida</a>. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> awarded the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> posthumously to Grissom on October 1, 1978. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> awarded it to White and Chaffee on December 17, 1997.
An Apollo 1 mission patch was left on the Moon's surface after the first manned lunar landing by <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> crew members <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and Buzz Aldrin. The <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a> mission left on the surface of the Moon a tiny memorial statue, "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>", along with a plaque containing the names of the Apollo 1 astronauts, among others including Soviet cosmonauts, who perished in the pursuit of human space flight.

After the Apollo 1 fire, <a href="Cape%20Canaveral%20Air%20Force%20Station%20Launch%20Complex%2034">Launch Complex 34</a> was subsequently used only for the launch of Apollo 7 and later dismantled down to the concrete launch pedestal, which remains at the site () along with a few other concrete and steel-reinforced structures. The pedestal bears two plaques commemorating the crew. Each year the families of the Apollo 1 crew are invited to the site for a memorial, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex includes the site during the tour of the historic Cape Canaveral launch sites.

In January 2005, three granite benches, built by a college classmate of one of the astronauts, were installed at the site on the southern edge of the launch pad. Each bears the name of one of the astronauts and his military service insignia.


The Apollo 1 Command Module has never been on public display. After the accident, the spacecraft was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate the cause of the fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a> in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.
On February 17, 2007, the parts of CM-012 were moved approximately to a newer, environmentally controlled warehouse. Only a few weeks earlier, Gus Grissom's brother Lowell publicly suggested CM-012 be permanently entombed in the concrete remains of <a href="Launch%20Complex%2034">Launch Complex 34</a>.

On January 27, 2017, the 50th anniversary of the fire, NASA put the hatch from Apollo 1 on display alongside the remains of <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger">"Challenger"</a> and <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia">"Columbia"</a>. “This is way, way, way long overdue. But we’re excited about it,” said Scott Grissom, <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>'s older son.

Apollo 10

Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo space program</a>, and the second (after <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a>) to orbit the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Launched on May 18, 1969, it was the <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">F mission</a>: a "dress rehearsal" for the first <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a>, testing all of the components and procedures, just short of actually landing. The <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) followed a descent orbit to within of the <a href="lunar%20surface">lunar surface</a>, at the point where powered descent for landing would normally begin. Its success enabled the first landing to be attempted on the <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> mission two months later.

According to the 2002 "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>", Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a manned vehicle: 39,897 km/h (11.08 km/s or 24,791 mph) on May 26, 1969, during the return from the Moon.

The mission's <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a>s included the names of the "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" characters <a href="Charlie%20Brown">Charlie Brown</a> and <a href="Snoopy">Snoopy</a>, which became Apollo 10's semi-official mascots. "Peanuts" creator <a href="Charles%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a> also drew some mission-related artwork for <a href="NASA">NASA</a>.



Apollo 10, along with Apollo 11, were the only Apollo missions whose crew were all veterans of spaceflight. <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Stafford">Thomas P. Stafford</a> had flown on <a href="Gemini%206A">Gemini 6</a> and <a href="Gemini%209A">Gemini 9</a>; <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John W. Young</a> had flown on <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a> and <a href="Gemini%2010">Gemini 10</a>, and <a href="Eugene%20Cernan">Eugene A. Cernan</a> had flown with Stafford on Gemini 9.

In addition, Apollo 10 was the only <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> flight from <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39B</a>, as preparations for Apollo 11 at LC-39A had begun in March almost immediately after <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a>'s launch.

They were also the only Apollo crew all of whose members went on to fly subsequent missions aboard <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29">Apollo spacecraft</a>: Young later commanded <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a>, Cernan commanded <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a> and Stafford commanded the U.S. vehicle on the <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz Test Project</a>. It was on this flight that John Young became the first human to fly solo around the Moon, while Stafford & Cernan flew the LM in lunar orbit as part of the preparations for Apollo 11.

The Apollo 10 crew are also the humans who have traveled the farthest away from home, some from their homes and families in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. While most Apollo missions orbited the Moon at the same from the lunar surface, the distance between the Earth and Moon varies by about , between <a href="perigee">perigee</a> and <a href="apogee">apogee</a>, throughout the year, and the Earth's rotation make the distance to Houston vary by another each day. The Apollo 10 crew reached the farthest point in their orbit around the far side of the Moon at about the same time Earth's rotation put Houston nearly a full Earth diameter away.

By the normal rotation in place during Apollo, the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13. However, <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a> was given the Apollo 13 command slot instead. <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">L. Gordon Cooper, Jr.</a>, Commander of the Apollo 10 backup crew, was enraged and resigned from NASA. Later, Shepard's crew was forced to switch places with <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>'s tentative <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a> crew.

<a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> wrote in his memoirs that Cooper and <a href="Donn%20F.%20Eisele">Donn F. Eisele</a> were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training and Eisele for incidents aboard <a href="Apollo%207">Apollo 7</a> and an <a href="affair%23Extramarital%20affair">extramarital affair</a>) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Astronaut%20Office">Astronaut Office</a> at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the <a href="Apollo%20Applications%20Program">Apollo Applications Program</a> (which was eventually cut down to only the <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> component) and not a lunar mission.

This dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a> to from the lunar surface, at the point where powered descent would begin on the actual landing. Practicing this approach orbit would refine knowledge of the <a href="Lunar%20orbit%23Perturbation%20effects">lunar gravitational field</a> needed to calibrate the powered descent guidance system to within (LR altitude update lock) needed for a landing. Earth-based observations, unmanned <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>, and <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> had respectively allowed calibration to within , , and . Except for this final stretch, the mission was designed to duplicate how a landing would have gone, both in space and for <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">ground control</a>, putting NASA's <a href="flight%20controller">flight controller</a>s and extensive tracking and control network through a rehearsal.






On May 22, 1969 at 20:35:02 UTC, a 27.4 second LM <a href="Descent%20Propulsion%20System">Descent Propulsion System</a> burn inserted the LM into a descent orbit of so that the resulting lowest point in the orbit occurred about 15° from lunar landing site 2 (the Apollo 11 landing site). The lowest measured point in the trajectory was above the lunar surface at 21:29:43 UTC.

Shortly after <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a>, Young performed the <a href="transposition%2C%20docking%2C%20and%20extraction">transposition, docking, and extraction</a> maneuver, separating the Command/Service Module (CSM) from the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> stage, turning around, and docking its nose to the top of the Lunar Module (LM), before separating from the S-IVB. Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a <a href="color%20television">color television</a> camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.
After reaching lunar orbit three days later, Young remained in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a> (CM) "Charlie Brown" while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM "Snoopy" and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent orbit insertion maneuver by firing their descent engine, and tested their craft's landing radar as they approached the altitude where powered descent would begin on Apollo 11. They surveyed the landing site in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Tranquility">Sea of Tranquility</a>, then separated the descent stage and fired the <a href="Ascent%20Propulsion%20System">ascent engine</a> to return to "Charlie Brown". The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field; its location was not tracked.

Upon descent stage separation and ascent engine ignition, the Lunar Module began to roll violently because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver. The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM. Cernan has said he observed the horizon spinning eight times over, indicating eight rolls of the spacecraft under ascent engine power. While the incident was downplayed by NASA, the roll was just several revolutions from being unrecoverable, which would have resulted in the LM crashing into the lunar surface.

The ascent stage was loaded with the amount of fuel it would have had remaining if it had lifted off from the surface and reached the altitude at which the Apollo 10 ascent stage fired. The fueled LM weighed , compared to for the Apollo 11 LM which made the first landing. Craig Nelson wrote in his book "Rocket Men" that NASA took special precaution to ensure Stafford and Cernan would not attempt to make the first landing. Nelson quoted Cernan as saying "A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might!' So the ascent module, the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full. So had we literally tried to land on the Moon, we couldn't have gotten off." In his own memoir, Cernan wrote "Our lander, LM-4...was still too heavy to guarantee safe margins for a moon landing."

After being jettisoned, "Snoopy's" ascent stage engine was fired to fuel depletion, sending it on a trajectory past the Moon into a <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">heliocentric orbit</a>. The <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> ascent stage was left in lunar orbit to eventually crash; all subsequent ascent stages were intentionally steered into the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the surface, except for the one on <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a>, which did not land but was used as a "life boat" to get the crew back to Earth, and burned up in Earth's atmosphere.
"Snoopy"'s ascent stage orbit was not tracked after 1969, and its current location is unknown. In 2011, a group of amateur astronomers in the UK started a project to search for it.

<a href="Splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">Splashdown</a> occurred in the Pacific Ocean on May 26, 1969, at 16:52:23 UTC, about east of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>. The astronauts were recovered by , and subsequently flown to <a href="Pago%20Pago%20International%20Airport">Pago Pago International Airport</a> in <a href="Tafuna%2C%20American%20Samoa">Tafuna</a> for a greeting reception, before being flown on a <a href="Lockheed%20C-141%20Starlifter">C-141</a> cargo plane to <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>.

After Apollo 10, NASA required astronauts to choose more "dignified" names for their Command and Lunar Modules. This proved unenforceable: Apollo 16 astronauts Young, Mattingly and Duke chose "Casper", as in <a href="Casper%20the%20Friendly%20Ghost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a>, for their Command Module name. The idea was to give children a way to identify with the mission by using humor.

The Command Module "Charlie Brown" is currently on loan to the <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum</a> in London, where it is on display. "Charlie Brown"'s <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) was jettisoned just before re-entry and burned up in the Earth's atmosphere.

After the <a href="translunar%20injection">insertion</a> into trans-Lunar orbit, the <a href="S-IVB">Saturn IVB</a> <a href="third%20stage">third stage</a> was accelerated past Earth <a href="escape%20velocity">escape velocity</a> and became a <a href="space%20debris">object</a> where it would continue to <a href="heliocentric%20orbit">orbit the Sun</a> for many years. , it remains in orbit.

The shield-shaped emblem for the flight shows a large, three-dimensional <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numeral</a> X sitting on the Moon's surface, in Stafford's words, "to show that we had left our mark." Although it did not land on the Moon, the prominence of the number represents the significant contributions the mission made to the Apollo program. A CSM circles the Moon as an LM ascent stage flies up from its low pass over the lunar surface with its engine firing. The Earth is visible in the background. On the mission patch, a wide, light blue border carries the word APOLLO at the top and the crew names around the bottom. The patch is trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by Allen Stevens of <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a>.

In February 2016 <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> broadcast a TV show suggesting that the mission witnessed mysterious or alien signals while on the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a>. The astronomers mention the odd whistling sound that lasted nearly an hour. It was speculated that this is an evidence for <a href="UFO%20conspiracy%20theory">UFO coverup</a>.
According to space journalist <a href="James%20Oberg">James Oberg</a> the sound was most probably <a href="electromagnetic%20interference">radio interference</a> between the Command Module and the Lunar Module landing vehicles. Describing it as "outer-space type music" was most probably due to <a href="Priming%20%28psychology%29">priming</a>, as suggested by <a href="Benjamin%20Radford">Benjamin Radford</a>.

Apollo 12

Apollo 12 was the sixth manned flight in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a> and the second to land on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> (an <a href="list%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">H type mission</a>). It was launched on November 14, 1969, from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, four months after <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>. Mission commander <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Charles "Pete" Conrad</a> and Lunar Module Pilot <a href="Alan%20Bean">Alan L. Bean</a> performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Richard F. Gordon</a> remained in lunar orbit. The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the <a href="Ocean%20of%20Storms">Ocean of Storms</a>.

Unlike the first landing on Apollo 11, Conrad and Bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location, the site of the "<a href="Surveyor%203">Surveyor 3</a>" unmanned probe, which had landed on April 20, 1967. They carried the first color television camera to the lunar surface on an Apollo flight, but transmission was lost after Bean accidentally destroyed the camera by pointing it at the Sun. On one of two moonwalks, they visited the "Surveyor" and removed some parts for return to Earth. The mission ended on November 24 with a successful <a href="Splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">splashdown</a>.








Apollo 12 launched on schedule from Kennedy Space Center, during a rainstorm. It was the first rocket launch attended by an incumbent US president, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. Thirty-six-and-a-half seconds after lift-off, the vehicle triggered a <a href="lightning">lightning</a> discharge through itself and down to the Earth through the Saturn's ionized plume. Protective circuits on the <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a>s in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) falsely detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline, along with much of the Command/Service Module (CSM) instrumentation. A second strike at 52 seconds after launch knocked out the "8-ball" <a href="attitude%20indicator">attitude indicator</a>. The <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a> stream at <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center%23Houston%20%281965%E2%80%93present%29">Mission Control</a> was garbled. However, the vehicle continued to fly correctly; the strikes had not affected the <a href="Saturn%20V%20Instrument%20Unit">Saturn V Instrument Unit</a>.

The loss of all three fuel cells put the CSM entirely on batteries, which were unable to maintain normal 75-ampere launch loads on the 28-volt DC bus. One of the <a href="Inverter%20%28electrical%29">AC inverter</a>s dropped offline. These power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction.

<a href="Flight%20controller%23Electrical%2C%20Environmental%20and%20Consumables%20Manager%20%28EECOM%29">Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)</a> <a href="John%20Aaron">John Aaron</a> remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power supply malfunctioned in the CSM Signal Conditioning Electronics (SCE), which converted raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders.

Aaron made a call, "Try SCE to aux," which switched the SCE to a backup power supply. The switch was fairly obscure, and neither <a href="Flight%20Director">Flight Director</a> <a href="Gerald%20D.%20Griffin">Gerald Griffin</a>, <a href="Capsule%20communicator">CAPCOM</a> <a href="Gerald%20P.%20Carr">Gerald Carr</a>, nor Mission Commander Pete Conrad immediately recognized it. Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean, flying in the right seat as the spacecraft systems engineer, remembered the SCE switch from a training incident a year earlier when the same failure had been <a href="simulated">simulated</a>. Aaron's quick thinking and Bean's memory saved what could have been an <a href="Apollo%20abort%20modes">aborted mission</a>, and earned Aaron the reputation of a "steely-eyed missile man". Bean put the fuel cells back on line, and with telemetry restored, the launch continued successfully. Once in Earth <a href="parking%20orbit">parking orbit</a>, the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage for <a href="trans-lunar%20injection">trans-lunar injection</a>. The lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage.

Initially, it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module</a>'s (CM) parachute mechanism to prematurely fire, disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them. If they were indeed disabled, the Command Module would have crashed uncontrollably into the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> and killed the crew instantly. Since there was no way to figure out whether or not this was the case, ground controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility. The parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission.

After <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) separation, the S-IVB was intended to fly into solar orbit. The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired, and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the Moon's trailing edge (the Apollo spacecraft always approached the Moon's leading edge). The Moon's gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit. However, a small error in the state vector in the Saturn's guidance system caused the S-IVB to fly past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve Earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable Earth orbit after passing the Moon on November 18, 1969. It finally escaped Earth orbit in 1971 but was briefly recaptured in Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer <a href="William%20Kwong%20Yu%20Yeung">Bill Yeung</a> who gave it the temporary designation <a href="J002E3">J002E3</a> before it was determined to be an artificial object.

The Apollo 12 mission landed on November 19, 1969, on an area of the Ocean of Storms that had been visited earlier by several unmanned missions ("<a href="Luna%205">Luna 5</a>", "<a href="Surveyor%203">Surveyor 3</a>", and "<a href="Ranger%207">Ranger 7</a>"). The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>, recognizing this, christened this region "<a href="Mare%20Cognitum">Mare Cognitum</a> (Known Sea)". The <a href="Selenographic%20coordinates">Lunar coordinates</a> of the landing site were 3.01239° S latitude, 23.42157° W longitude. The landing site would thereafter be listed as "Statio Cognitum" on lunar maps. Conrad and Bean did not formally name their landing site, though Conrad nicknamed the intended touchdown area "Pete's Parking Lot".

The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting, which would be needed for future Apollo missions. Most of the descent was automatic, with manual control assumed by Conrad during the final few hundred feet of descent. Unlike Apollo 11, where <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> had to use the manual control to direct his lander downrange of the computer's target which was strewn with boulders, Apollo 12 succeeded in landing at its intended target – within walking distance of the "Surveyor 3" probe, which had landed on the Moon in April 1967. This was the first – and, to date, only – occasion in which humans have "caught up" to a probe sent to land on another world.

Conrad actually landed "Intrepid" short of "Pete's Parking Lot", because it looked rougher during final approach than anticipated, and was a little under from "Surveyor 3", a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust (being kicked up by "Intrepid's" descent engine during landing) from covering "Surveyor 3". But the actual touchdown point–approximately from "Surveyor 3"–did cause high velocity sandblasting of the probe. It was later determined that the sandblasting removed more dust than it delivered onto the "Surveyor", because the probe was covered by a thin layer that gave it a tan hue as observed by the astronauts, and every portion of the surface exposed to the direct sandblasting was lightened back toward the original white color through the removal of lunar dust.

When Conrad, who was somewhat shorter than Neil Armstrong, stepped onto the lunar surface, his first words were "Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me." This was not an off-the-cuff remark: Conrad had made a bet with reporter <a href="Oriana%20Fallaci">Oriana Fallaci</a> he would say these words, after she had queried whether NASA had instructed Neil Armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the Moon. Conrad later said he was never able to collect the money.

To improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera that was used on Apollo 11). Unfortunately, when Bean carried the camera to the place near the Lunar Module where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera%23Westinghouse%20Lunar%20Color%20Camera">Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) tube</a>. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately. See also: <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">Apollo TV camera</a>.

Apollo 12 successfully landed within walking distance of the <a href="Surveyor%203">Surveyor 3</a> probe. Conrad and Bean removed pieces of the probe to be taken back to Earth for analysis. It is claimed that the common <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a> "<a href="Streptococcus%20mitis">Streptococcus mitis</a>" was found to have accidentally contaminated the spacecraft's camera prior to launch and survived dormant in this harsh environment for two and a half years. However, this finding has since been disputed: see <a href="Reports%20of%20Streptococcus%20mitis%20on%20the%20Moon">Reports of "Streptococcus mitis" on the Moon</a>.

Astronauts Conrad and Bean also collected rocks and set up equipment that took measurements of the Moon's <a href="Lunar%20seismology">seismicity</a>, <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> flux and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>, and relayed the measurements to Earth. The instruments were part of the first complete nuclear-powered <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">ALSEP</a> station set up by astronauts on the Moon to relay long-term data from the lunar surface. The instruments on Apollo 11 were not as extensive or designed to operate long term. The astronauts also took photographs, although by accident Bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface. Meanwhile, Gordon, on board the "Yankee Clipper" in lunar orbit, took multi-spectral photographs of the surface.

The <a href="lunar%20plaque">lunar plaque</a> attached to the descent stage of "Intrepid" is unique in that unlike the other plaques, it (a) did not have a depiction of the Earth, and (b) it was textured differently (the other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the Apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat).

"Intrepid's" ascent stage was dropped (per normal procedures) after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit. It impacted the Moon on November 20, 1969, at . The seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.

The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs, for a total lunar surface stay of 31 and a half hours and a total time in lunar orbit of eighty-nine hours.

On the return flight to Earth after leaving lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 12 witnessed (and photographed) a <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, though this one was of the Earth eclipsing the Sun.

"Yankee Clipper" returned to Earth on November 24, 1969 at 20:58 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> (3:58pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">EST</a>, 10:58am <a href="Hawaii-Aleutian%20time%20zone">HST</a>), in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 500 nautical miles (800 km) east of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>. During <a href="splashdown">splashdown</a>, a <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm film</a> camera dislodged from storage and struck Bean in the forehead, rendering him briefly unconscious. He suffered a mild concussion and needed six stitches. After recovery by , they were flown to <a href="Pago%20Pago%20International%20Airport">Pago Pago International Airport</a> in <a href="Tafuna%2C%20American%20Samoa">Tafuna</a> for a reception, before being flown on a <a href="C-141">C-141</a> cargo plane to <a href="Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii">Honolulu</a>.


The Apollo 12 mission patch shows the crew's navy background; all three astronauts at the time of the mission were <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">commanders</a>. It features a <a href="clipper%20ship">clipper ship</a> arriving at the Moon, representing the Command Module "Yankee Clipper". The ship trails fire, and flies the flag of the United States. The mission name APOLLO XII and the crew names are on a wide gold border, with a small blue trim. Blue and gold are traditional U.S. Navy colors. The patch has four stars on it — one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for <a href="Clifton%20Williams">Clifton Williams</a>, a U.S. Marine Corps aviator and astronaut who was killed on October 5, 1967, after a mechanical failure caused the controls of his <a href="Northrop%20T-38%20Talon">T-38</a> trainer to stop responding, resulting in a crash. He trained with Conrad and Gordon as part of the backup crew for what would be the <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a> mission, and would have been assigned as Lunar Module Pilot for Apollo 12.

The Apollo 12 Command Module "Yankee Clipper" is on display at the <a href="Virginia%20Air%20and%20Space%20Center">Virginia Air and Space Center</a> in <a href="Hampton%2C%20Virginia">Hampton, Virginia</a>.

In 2002, astronomers thought they might have discovered another moon orbiting Earth, which they designated <a href="J002E3">J002E3</a>, that turned out to be the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage of the Apollo 12 Saturn V rocket.

The Lunar Module "Intrepid" impacted the Moon November 20, 1969 at 22:17:17.7 UT (5:17 PM EST) . In 2009, the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO) photographed the Apollo 12 landing site. The "Intrepid" Lunar Module descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), "Surveyor 3" spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

Portions of the Apollo 12 mission are dramatized in the miniseries "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">From the Earth to the Moon</a>" episode entitled "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29%23Episodes">That's All There Is</a>".

Apollo 14

Apollo 14 was the eighth manned mission in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>, and the third to <a href="Moon%20landing">land</a> on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. It was the last of the "<a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">H missions</a>," targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar <a href="Extravehicular%20activity">EVA</a>s, or moonwalks.

Commander <a href="Alan%20Shepard">Alan Shepard</a>, <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Command%20Module%20%28CM%29">Command Module Pilot</a> <a href="Stuart%20Roosa">Stuart Roosa</a>, and <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module Pilot</a> <a href="Edgar%20Mitchell">Edgar Mitchell</a> launched on their nine-day mission on January 31, 1971 at 4:04:02 p.m. local time after a 40-minute, 2 second delay due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program. Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February 5 in the <a href="Fra%20Mauro%20formation">Fra Mauro formation</a> - originally the target of the aborted <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> mission. During the two lunar EVAs, of <a href="Moon%20rock">Moon rock</a>s were collected, and several <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">scientific experiments</a> were performed. Shepard hit two <a href="golf%20ball">golf ball</a>s on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought with him. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33½ hours on the Moon, with almost 9½ hours of EVA.

In the aftermath of Apollo 13, several modifications had been made to the Service Module electrical power system to prevent a repeat of that accident, including a redesign of the oxygen tanks and the addition of a third tank.

While Shepard and Mitchell were on the surface, Roosa remained in <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a> aboard the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> "Kitty Hawk", performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a> mission. He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were <a href="Germination">germinated</a> on return, resulting in the so-called <a href="Moon%20tree">Moon tree</a>s. Shepard, Roosa, and Mitchell landed in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> on February 9.

Shepard was the oldest U.S. <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> when he made his trip aboard Apollo 14. He is the only astronaut from <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a> (the original <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a> astronauts) to reach the Moon. Another of the original seven, <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a>, had (as <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>'s backup commander) tentatively been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author <a href="Andrew%20Chaikin">Andrew Chaikin</a>, his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with <a href="NASA">NASA</a> hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the <a href="Mercury-Atlas%209">Mercury-Atlas 9</a> flight), resulted in his removal.

The mission was a personal triumph for Shepard, who had battled back from <a href="M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re%27s%20disease">Ménière's disease</a> which grounded him from 1964 to 1968. He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA officials switched the scheduled crews for Apollos 13 and 14. This was done to allow Shepard more time to train for his flight, as he had been grounded for four years.

Apollo 14 launched during heavy cloud cover and the Saturn V booster quickly disappeared from view. NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in <a href="Vero%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Vero Beach</a>, had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch. Following the launch, the <a href="Launch%20Control%20Center">Launch Control Center</a> at <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> was visited by <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Vice President</a> <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro T. Agnew</a>, <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">Prince Juan Carlos</a> of <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and his wife, <a href="Queen%20Sof%C3%ADa%20of%20Spain">Princess Sofía</a>.

At the beginning of the mission, the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">CSM</a> "Kitty Hawk" had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">LM</a> "Antares". Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1 hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that Roosa hold "Kitty Hawk" against "Antares" using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches. The sixth attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.

After separating from the Command Module in lunar orbit, the LM "Antares" also had two serious problems. First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch. NASA believed that the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit. The immediate solution — tapping on the panel next to the switch — did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again. If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module%23Ascent%20stage">ascent stage</a> to separate from the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module%23Descent%20stage">descent stage</a> and climb back into orbit. NASA and the software teams at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> scrambled to find a solution, and determined the fix would involve reprogramming the flight software to ignore the false signal. The <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">software modifications</a> were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.

A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM <a href="Doppler%20radar">landing radar</a> failed to lock automatically onto the Moon's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation). After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near , again just in time. Shepard then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other six Moon landing missions. Mitchell believed that Shepard would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues. A post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.

Shepard and Mitchell named their landing site "Fra Mauro Base", and this designation is recognized by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as "Statio Fra Mauro").

Shepard's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, "And it's been a long way, but we're here." Unlike <a href="Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> on <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a> and <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Pete Conrad</a> on Apollo 12, Shepard had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards (meters) away before he spoke.

Shepard's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade "hood," so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface; on the <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion. This feature was included on <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a>'s Apollo 13 suit; because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it. This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the EVAs of <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and Russian <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a>s on the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

After landing in the Fra Mauro formation—the destination for Apollo 13—Shepard and Mitchell took two moonwalks, adding new <a href="Apollo%2014%20Passive%20Seismic%20Experiment">seismic studies</a> to the by now familiar <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP), and using the <a href="Modular%20Equipment%20Transporter">Modular Equipment Transporter</a> (MET), a pull-cart for carrying equipment and samples, nicknamed "lunar rickshaw". Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board Command Module "Kitty Hawk" in lunar orbit.

The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the wide Cone Crater. The two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes. They became physically exhausted from the attempt and with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off. Later analysis, using the pictures that they took, determined that they had come within an estimated of the crater's rim. Images from the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30 m of the rim.
Shepard and Mitchell deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost of lunar samples for return to Earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements included the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon. Shepard brought along a <a href="Golf%20club%23Iron">six iron golf club head</a> which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit). He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went "miles and miles and miles" in the low lunar <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, but later estimated the distance as . Mitchell then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a <a href="Javelin%20throw">javelin</a>.

On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.

The Command Module "Kitty Hawk" splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately south of <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>. After recovery by the ship <a href="USS%20New%20Orleans%20%28LPH-11%29">USS "New Orleans"</a>, the crew was flown to <a href="Pago%20Pago%20International%20Airport">Pago Pago International Airport</a> in <a href="Tafuna%2C%20American%20Samoa">Tafuna</a> for a reception before being flown on a <a href="Lockheed%20C-141%20Starlifter">C-141</a> cargo plane to <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be <a href="Mobile%20Quarantine%20Facility">quarantined</a> on their return from the Moon.

Roosa, who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight. These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative <a href="Moon%20tree">Moon tree</a>s.

The oval insignia shows a gold NASA <a href="Astronaut%20badge%23NASA%20astronaut%20pins">Astronaut Pin</a>, given to U.S. astronauts upon completing their first space flight, traveling from the Earth to the Moon. A gold band around the edge includes the mission and astronaut names. The designer was Jean Beaulieu.

The backup crew spoofed the patch with its own version, with revised artwork showing a <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20The%20Road%20Runner">Wile E. Coyote</a> cartoon character depicted as gray-bearded (for Shepard, who was 47 at the time of the mission and the oldest man on the Moon), pot-bellied (for Mitchell, who had a pudgy appearance) and red furred (for Roosa's red hair), still on the way to the Moon, while <a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20The%20Road%20Runner">Road Runner</a> (for the backup crew) is already on the Moon, holding a U.S. flag and a flag labeled "1st Team." The flight name is replaced by "BEEP BEEP" and the backup crew's names are given. Several of these patches were hidden by the backup crew and found during the flight by the crew in notebooks and storage lockers in both the CSM "Kitty Hawk" and the LM "Antares" spacecraft, and one patch was even stored on the MET lunar hand cart.

The Apollo 14 Command Module "Kitty Hawk" is on display at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Visitor%20Complex%23Apollo/Saturn%20V%20Center">Apollo/Saturn V Center</a> building at the Kennedy Space Center after being on display at the <a href="United%20States%20Astronaut%20Hall%20of%20Fame">United States Astronaut Hall of Fame</a> near <a href="Titusville%2C%20Florida">Titusville, Florida</a>, for several years.

The ascent stage of Lunar Module "Antares" impacted the Moon on February 7, 1971 at 00:45:25.7 UT (February 6, 7:45 PM EST) . "Antares"' descent stage and the mission's other equipment remain at Fra Mauro at .

Photographs taken in 2009 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter were released on July 17, and the Fra Mauro equipment was the most visible Apollo hardware at that time, owing to particularly good lighting conditions. In 2011, the LRO returned to the landing site at a lower altitude to take higher resolution photographs.

Apollo 15

Apollo 15 was the ninth manned mission in the United States' <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>, the fourth to <a href="Moon%20landing">land</a> on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, and the eighth successful manned mission. It was the first of what were termed "<a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">J missions</a>", long stays on the Moon, with a greater focus on science than had been possible on previous missions. It was also the first mission on which the <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> was used.

The mission began on July 26, 1971, and ended on August 7. At the time, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> called it the most successful manned flight ever achieved.

Commander <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> and Lunar Module Pilot <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a> spent three days on the Moon, including 18½ hours outside the <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> on lunar <a href="extra-vehicular%20activity">extra-vehicular activity</a> (EVA). The mission landed near <a href="Mons%20Hadley">Hadley rille</a>, in an area of the <a href="Mare%20Imbrium">Mare Imbrium</a> called "Palus Putredinus" (Marsh of Decay). The crew explored the area using the first lunar rover, which allowed them to travel much farther from the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) than had been possible on missions without the rover. They collected of lunar surface material. At the same time, Command Module Pilot <a href="Alfred%20Worden">Alfred Worden</a> orbited the Moon, using a Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) to study the lunar surface and environment in great detail with a panoramic camera, a <a href="Gamma%20ray%20spectrometer">gamma-ray spectrometer</a>, a mapping camera, a laser <a href="altimeter">altimeter</a>, a <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a>, and a lunar sub-satellite deployed at the end of Apollo 15's stay in <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a> (an Apollo program first).

The mission successfully accomplished its objectives, but was marred by negative publicity that accompanied disclosure of <a href="Apollo%2015%20postage%20stamp%20incident">the crew carrying unauthorized postage stamps</a> which they had planned to sell after their return. Ironically, this mission was one of very few that had been honored with the issue of <a href="U.S.%20space%20exploration%20history%20on%20U.S.%20stamps%23Space%20Achievement%20Decade%20Issue%20of%201971">a commemorative US stamp</a>, with this first use of a lunar rover happening one decade after the <a href="Mercury-Redstone%203">first Mercury astronaut launch</a>.

All three astronauts on the all-<a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> crew received an honorary degree or master's degree from the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, including Scott's honorary degree, awarded in the spring of 1971, months before the launch. Scott had attended the University of Michigan, but left before graduating to accept an appointment to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>. The crewmen did their undergraduate work at either the United States Military Academy or the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>.

Schmitt was the first member of <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%204">Group 4</a> to be selected as a prime or backup crew member for an Apollo flight; from Group 4 he was the only astronaut to make it to the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, with the <a href="Apollo%2017">last Apollo mission</a> at the end of 1972.







The crew for Apollo 15 had previously served as the backup crew for <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>. There had been a friendly rivalry between that prime and backup crew on that mission, with the prime being all <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and the backup all United States Air Force.

Originally Apollo 15 would have been an <a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">H mission</a>, like Apollos 12, <a href="Apollo%2013">13</a> and <a href="Apollo%2014">14</a>. But on September 2, 1970, NASA announced it was canceling what were to be the current incarnations of the Apollo 15 and <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions">Apollo 19</a> missions. To maximize the return from the remaining missions, Apollo 15 would now fly as a J mission and have the honor of carrying the first lunar rover.

One of the major changes in the training for Apollo 15 was the geology training. Although on previous flights the crews had been trained in field geology, for the first time Apollo 15 would make it a high priority. Scott and Irwin would train with <a href="Leon%20Silver">Leon Silver</a>, a <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a> geologist who on Earth was interested in the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a>. Silver had been suggested by <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a> as an alternative to the classroom lecturers that NASA had previously used. Among other things, Silver had made important refinements to the methods for dating rocks using the decay of <a href="uranium">uranium</a> into <a href="lead">lead</a> in the late 1950s.

At first Silver would take the prime and backup crews to various geological sites in Arizona and New Mexico as if for a normal field geology lesson, but as launch time approached, these trips became more realistic. Crews began to wear mock-ups of the backpacks they would carry, and communicate using <a href="walkie-talkie">walkie-talkie</a>s to a CAPCOM in a tent. (During a mission the <a href="Flight%20controller%23Capsule%20Communicator%20%28CAPCOM%29">Capsule Communicators</a> (CAPCOMs), always fellow astronauts, were the only people who normally would speak to the crew.) The CAPCOM was accompanied by a group of geologists unfamiliar with the area who would rely on the astronauts' descriptions to interpret the findings.

The decision to land at Hadley came in September 1970. The Site Selection Committees had narrowed the field down to two sites — Hadley Rille or the crater <a href="Marius%20%28crater%29">Marius</a>, near which were a <a href="Marius%20Hills">group of low, possibly volcanic, domes</a>. Although not ultimately his decision, the commander of a mission always held great sway. To David Scott the choice was clear, with Hadley, being "exploration at its finest."

Command Module Pilot Alfred Worden undertook a different kind of geology training. Working with an Egyptian-born geologist, <a href="Farouk%20El-Baz">Farouk El-Baz</a>, he flew over areas in an airplane simulating the speed at which terrain would pass below him while in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) in orbit. He became quite adept at making geologic observations as objects passed below.

Apollo 15 was launched on July 26, 1971, at 9:34 AM <a href="Eastern%20time">EDT</a> from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> at <a href="Merritt%20Island">Merritt Island</a>, Florida. During the launch, the <a href="S-IC">S-IC</a> did not completely shut off following staging for four seconds, creating the possibility of the spent stage banging into the <a href="S-II">S-II</a> engines, damaging them and forcing an abort (the S-II exhaust also struck a telemetry package on the S-IC and caused it to fail). Despite this, the third stage and spacecraft reached its planned Earth parking orbit. A couple of hours into the mission, the third stage reignited to propel the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and on to the Moon.

A few days after launching from Florida, the spacecraft passed behind the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a>, where the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Propulsion%20System">Service Propulsion System</a> (SPS) engine on the CSM ignited for a six-minute burn, to slow the craft down into an initial lunar orbit. Once the lowest point of altitude in the orbit was reached, the SPS engine was fired again, to place the spacecraft into the proper descent orbit for the Lunar Module landing at <a href="Mons%20Hadley">Hadley</a>.

Most of the first part of the day after arriving in lunar orbit on July 30 was spent in preparing the Lunar Module for descent to the lunar surface later on that day. When preparations were complete, un-docking from the CSM was attempted; it did not occur, because of a faulty seal in the hatch mechanism. The Command Module Pilot, Alfred Worden, re-sealed the hatch; the LM then separated from the CSM. David Scott and James Irwin continued preparations for the descent while Worden remained in the CSM, returning to a higher orbit to perform lunar observations and await his crewmates' return a few days later.

Soon, Scott and Irwin began the descent to the <a href="Hadley%E2%80%93Apennine">Hadley landing site</a>. Several minutes after descent was initiated, at pitch-over and the beginning of the approach phase of the landing, the LM was six kilometers east of the pre-selected landing target. On learning this, Scott altered the flight path of the LM. They touched down at 22:16:29 UTC on July 30 at Hadley, within a few hundred meters of the planned landing site. One of the legs of the LM landed in a small crater so the module was tilted by 10° – the maximum acceptable was 15°. While previous crews had exited the Lunar Module shortly after landing, the crew of Apollo 15 elected to spend the rest of the day inside the LM, waiting until the next day to perform the first of three EVAs, or moonwalks, in order to preserve their sleep rhythm on a mission on which they were to spend a significantly longer time on the surface than previous crews had spent. Before they slept, Scott performed a stand-up EVA, during which the LM was depressurized and he photographed their surroundings from the top docking hatch.

Throughout the sleep period, <a href="Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control</a>, in Houston, monitored a slow but steady oxygen leak. The data output of the onboard telemetry computers was limited during the night to conserve energy, so controllers could not determine the exact cause of the leak without awaking the crew. Scott and Irwin eventually were awakened an hour early, and the source of the leak was found to be an open valve on the urine transfer device. After the problem was solved, the crew began preparation for the first Moon walk.

Four hours later, Scott and Irwin became the seventh and eighth humans, respectively, to walk on the Moon. After unloading the <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> (LRV), the two drove to the first moonwalk's primary destination, Elbow Crater, along the edge of <a href="Hadley%20Rille">Hadley Rille</a>. On returning to the LM "Falcon", Scott and Irwin deployed the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP). The first EVA lasted about 6½ hours.

The target of the second EVA, the next day, was the edge of <a href="Mons%20Hadley">Mount Hadley Delta</a>, where the pair sampled boulders and craters along the <a href="Montes%20Apenninus">Apennine Front</a>. During this moonwalk, the astronauts recovered what came to be one of the more famous lunar samples collected on the Moon during <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo</a>, sample #15415, more commonly known as the "<a href="Genesis%20Rock">Genesis Rock</a>." Once back at the landing site, Scott continued to try to drill holes for an experiment at the ALSEP site, with which he had struggled the day before. After conducting soil-mechanics experiments and erecting a <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">U.S. flag</a>, Scott and Irwin returned to the LM. EVA 2 lasted 7 hours and 12 minutes.

During EVA 3, the third and final moonwalk of the mission, the crew again ventured to the edge of Hadley Rille, this time to the northwest of the immediate landing site. After returning to the LM's location, Scott performed an experiment in view of the <a href="Apollo%20TV%20camera">television camera</a>, using a feather and hammer to demonstrate <a href="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s theory that all objects in a given gravity field fall at the same rate, regardless of mass (in the absence of aerodynamic drag). He dropped the hammer and feather at the same time; because of the negligible lunar atmosphere, there was no drag on the feather, which hit the ground at the same time as the hammer.

Scott then drove the rover to a position away from the LM, where the television camera could be used to observe the lunar liftoff. Before the mission, the crew had contacted Belgian <a href="Sculpture">sculptor</a> <a href="Paul%20Van%20Hoeydonck">Paul Van Hoeydonck</a> to create a small aluminum statuette called "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>" to commemorate those astronauts and cosmonauts who lost their lives in the pursuit of space exploration. Scott left the sculpture by the rover, along with a plaque bearing the names of 14 known American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts deceased by that time. The memorial was left while the television camera was turned off; only Irwin knew what Scott was doing at the time. Scott told mission control he was doing some cleanup activities around the rover.

The EVA lasted 4 hours and 50 minutes. In total, the two astronauts spent 18½ hours outside the LM and collected approximately of lunar samples.

After lifting off from the lunar surface 2 days and 18 hours after landing, the LM ascent stage rendezvoused and re-docked with the CSM with Worden aboard in orbit. After transferring samples and other items from the LM to the CSM, the LM was sealed off, jettisoned, and intentionally crashed into the lunar surface. After completing more observations of the Moon from orbit and releasing the sub-satellite, the three-person crew departed lunar orbit with another burn of the SPS engine.

The next day, on the return trip to Earth, Worden performed a spacewalk in deep space, the first of its kind, to retrieve exposed film from the SIM bay. Later on in the day, the crew set a record for the longest Apollo flight to that point.

On approach to Earth the next day, August 7, the Service Module was jettisoned, and the Command Module (CM) <a href="Atmospheric%20reentry">reentered the Earth's atmosphere</a>. Although one of the three parachutes on the CM failed to deploy properly, only two were required for a safe landing (one extra for redundancy). Upon landing in the North Pacific Ocean, the crew were recovered and taken aboard the recovery ship, after a mission lasting 12 days, 7 hours, 11 minutes, and 53 seconds.

Apollo 15 used Command/Service Module CSM-112, which was given the <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a> "Endeavour", named after the <a href="HMS%20Endeavour">HMS "Endeavour"</a> and Lunar Module LM-10, call sign "Falcon", named after the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Academy">United States Air Force Academy</a> mascot. If Apollo 15 had flown as an H mission, it would have been with CSM-111 and LM-9. That CSM was used by the <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz Test Project</a> in 1975, but the Lunar Module went unused and is now on display at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Visitor%20Complex">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</a>.

Technicians at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> had many problems with the SIM bay in the Service Module. It was the first time it had flown and experienced problems from the start. Problems came from the fact the instruments were designed to operate in zero gravity, but had to be tested in the 1 <a href="g-force">g</a> on the surface of the Earth. As such, things like the 7.5 m booms for the <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass</a> and <a href="gamma%20ray%20spectrometer">gamma ray spectrometer</a>s could only be tested using railings that tried to mimic the space environment, and so they never worked particularly well. When the technicians tried to integrate the entire bay into the rest of the spacecraft, <a href="data%20stream">data stream</a>s would not synchronize, and lead investigators of the instruments would want to make last minute checks and changes. When it came time to test the operation of the gamma-ray spectrometer, it was necessary to stop every engine within of the test site.

On the Lunar Module, the <a href="fuel">fuel</a> and <a href="oxidizer">oxidizer</a> tanks were enlarged on both the descent and ascent stages and the <a href="Rocket%20engine%20nozzle">engine bell</a> on the descent stage was extended. Batteries and <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s were added for increased electrical power. In all this increased the weight of the Lunar Module to , heavier than previous models.

"Endeavour" is currently on display at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>.

The Lunar Roving Vehicle had been in development since May 1969, with the contract awarded to <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>. It could be folded into a space 5 ft by 20 in (1.5 m by 0.5 m). Unloaded it weighed 460 lb (209 kg) and when carrying two astronauts and their equipment, 1500 lb (700 kg). Each wheel was independently driven by a ¼ <a href="horsepower">horsepower</a> (200 W) electric motor. Although it could be driven by either astronaut, the Commander always drove. Travelling at speeds up to 6 to 8 mph (10 to 12 km/h), it meant that for the first time the astronauts could travel far afield from their lander and still have enough time to do some scientific experiments.

The Apollo 15 subsatellite (PFS-1) was a small satellite released into lunar orbit from the SIM bay. Its main objectives were to study the plasma, particle, and magnetic field environment of the Moon and map the lunar gravity field. Specifically, it measured plasma and energetic particle intensities and vector magnetic fields, and facilitated tracking of the satellite velocity to high precision. A basic requirement was that the satellite acquire fields and particle data everywhere on the orbit around the Moon. The Moon's roughly circular orbit about the Earth at ~380,000 km (60 Earth radii) carried the subsatellite into both interplanetary space and various regions of the Earth's magnetosphere. The satellite orbited the Moon and returned data from August 4, 1971 until January 1973.

In later years, through a study of many lunar orbiting satellites, scientists came to discover that most <a href="Lunar%20orbit">low lunar orbits</a> (LLO) are unstable. Fortunately, PFS-1 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, very near to one of only four lunar "<a href="frozen%20orbit">frozen orbit</a>s", where a lunar satellite may remain indefinitely.

Releasing the subsatellite was the crew's final activity in lunar orbit, occurring an hour before the burn to take them back to Earth. A 
<a href="PFS-2">virtually identical subsatellite</a> was deployed by <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a>.

The <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> that launched Apollo 15 was designated SA-510, the tenth flight-ready model of the rocket. As the payload of the rocket was greater, changes were made to its launch trajectory and Saturn V itself. The rocket was launched in a more southerly direction (80–100 degrees <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a>) and the Earth <a href="parking%20orbit">parking orbit</a> lowered to above the Earth's surface. These two changes meant more could be launched. The <a href="propellant">propellant</a> reserves were reduced and the number of retrorockets on the S-IC first stage (used to separate the spent first stage from the S-II second stage) reduced from eight to four. The four outboard engines of the S-IC would be burned longer and the center engine would also burn longer before being shut down (see <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> for more information on the launch sequence). Changes were also made to the S-II to stop <a href="pogo%20oscillation">pogo oscillation</a>s.

Once all the various components had been installed on the Saturn V, it was moved to the launch site, Launch Complex 39A. During late June and early July 1971, the rocket and Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) were struck by <a href="lightning">lightning</a> at least four times. All was well however, with only minor damage suffered.

The astronauts themselves wore new <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a>s. On all previous Apollo flights, including the non-lunar flights, the commander and lunar module pilot had worn suits with the life support, liquid cooling, and communications connections in two parallel rows of three. On Apollo 15, the new suits, dubbed the "<a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L%23A7LB%20Spacesuit%20%28Apollo%2C%20Skylab%20and%20ASTP%29">A7LB</a>," had the connectors situated in triangular pairs. This new arrangement, along with the relocation of the entry zipper (which went in an up-down motion on the old suits), from the right shoulder to the left hip, allowed the inclusion of a new waist joint, allowing the astronauts to bend completely over and to sit on the rover. Upgraded backpacks allowed for longer-duration moonwalks, and the Command Module Pilot, who wore a suit with three connectors, would wear a five-connector version of the old Moon suit — the liquid cooling water connector being removed, as the Command Module Pilot would make a "deep-space EVA" to retrieve film cartridges on the flight home.

After a successful mission, the reputations of the crew and NASA were tarnished by a deal the crew had made with a German stamp dealer. <a href="H.%20Walter%20Eiermann">H. Walter Eiermann</a>, who had many professional and social contacts with NASA employees and the astronaut corps, arranged for Scott to carry unauthorized commemorative postal covers in his space suit, in addition to the postal covers NASA had contracted to carry for the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a>. Eiermann had promised each astronaut $7,000 in the form of savings accounts in return for 100 covers signed after having been on the Moon. He told the astronauts that he would not advertise or sell the covers until the end of the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>. Irwin wrote in his book "To Rule the Night" that the astronauts had agreed to the deal as a way to help finance their children's college tuition.

Another controversy arose after the flight, caused by the "<a href="Fallen%20Astronaut">Fallen Astronaut</a>" statuette that Scott had left on the Moon. The crew claim they had agreed with the sculptor, <a href="Paul%20Van%20Hoeydonck">Paul Van Hoeydonck</a>, that no replicas were to be made, in order to satisfy NASA's aversion to commercial exploitation of the space program. After the sculpture's existence was publicly disclosed during their post-flight press conference, the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> contacted the crew asking for a replica made for the museum. Van Hoeydonck, whose account of the agreement contradicts Scott's, subsequently advertised replicas for sale to the public. Under pressure from NASA, Van Hoeydonck withdrew the sale offer.

The three astronauts of Apollo 15 were all United States Air Force active duty officers, and their patch carries Air Force motifs (just as the Apollo 12 all-Navy crew's patch had featured a sailing ship). The circular patch features stylized red, white and blue birds flying over the <a href="Hadley%20Rille">Hadley Rille</a> section of the Moon. Immediately behind the birds, a line of craters form the <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numeral</a> XV. The artwork is circled in red, with a white band giving the mission and crew names and a blue border. Scott contacted fashion designer <a href="Emilio%20Pucci">Emilio Pucci</a> to design the patch, who came up with the basic idea of the three-bird motif on a square patch. The crew changed the shape to round and the colors from blues and greens to a patriotic red, white and blue. Worden stated that each bird also represented an astronaut, white being his own color (and as Command Module Pilot, uppermost), with Scott the blue bird and Irwin the red. The Roman numeral design was created when NASA insisted that the mission number be displayed in <a href="Arabic%20numerals">Arabic numerals</a>.

The halo area of the Apollo 15 landing site, generated by the LM's exhaust plume, was observed by a camera aboard the Japanese lunar orbiter <a href="SELENE">SELENE</a> and confirmed by comparative analysis of photographs in May 2008. This corresponds well to photographs taken from the Apollo 15 Command Module showing a change in surface reflectivity due to the plume, and was the first visible trace of manned landings on the Moon seen from space since the close of the <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>.

Apollo 16

Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo space program</a>, the fifth and penultimate to <a href="Moon%20landing">land</a> on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> and the first to land in the <a href="Geology%20of%20the%20Moon%23The%20highlands">lunar highlands</a>. The second of the so-called "<a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">J missions</a>," it was crewed by Commander <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John Young</a>, <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module Pilot</a> <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a> and <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command Module Pilot</a> <a href="Ken%20Mattingly">Ken Mattingly</a>. Launched from the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted 11 days, 1 hour, and 51 minutes, and concluded at 2:45 PM EST on April 27.

Young and Duke spent 71 hours—just under three days—on the lunar surface, during which they conducted three <a href="Extra-vehicular%20activity">extra-vehicular activities</a> or moonwalks, totaling 20 hours and 14 minutes. The pair drove the <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> (LRV), the second produced and used on the Moon, . On the surface, Young and Duke collected of lunar samples for return to Earth, while Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly orbited in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM) above to perform observations. Mattingly spent 126 hours and 64 revolutions in lunar orbit. After Young and Duke rejoined Mattingly in lunar orbit, the crew released a <a href="Apollo%2016%23Lunar%20subsatellite%20PFS-2">subsatellite</a> from the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM). During the return trip to Earth, Mattingly performed a one-hour spacewalk to retrieve several film cassettes from the exterior of the Service Module.

Apollo 16's landing spot in the highlands was chosen to allow the astronauts to gather geologically older lunar material than the samples obtained in the first four landings, which were in or near <a href="Lunar%20mare">lunar maria</a>. Samples from the <a href="Descartes%20Highlands">Descartes Formation</a> and the <a href="Cayley%20%28crater%29">Cayley Formation</a> disproved a hypothesis that the formations were <a href="Volcano">volcanic</a> in origin.

Mattingly had originally been assigned to the prime crew of <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a>, but was exposed to the <a href="measles">measles</a> through Duke, at that time on the back-up crew for Apollo 13, who had caught it from one of his children. He never contracted the illness, but was nevertheless removed from the crew and replaced by his backup, <a href="Jack%20Swigert">Jack Swigert</a>, three days before the launch. Young, a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">captain</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, had flown on three spaceflights prior to Apollo 16: <a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a>, <a href="Gemini%2010">Gemini 10</a> and <a href="Apollo%2010">Apollo 10</a>, which orbited the Moon. One of 19 astronauts selected by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> in April 1966, Duke had never flown in space before Apollo 16. He served on the support crew of Apollo 10 and was a <a href="Flight%20controller%23Capsule%20Communicator%20%28CAPCOM%29">Capsule Communicator</a> (CAPCOM) for <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>.

Although not officially announced, the original backup crew consisted of <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred W. Haise</a> (CDR), <a href="William%20R.%20Pogue">William R. Pogue</a> (CMP) and <a href="Gerald%20P.%20Carr">Gerald P. Carr</a> (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions">Apollo 19</a>. However, after the cancellations of Apollos <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions">18</a> and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled to serve as members of the backup crew after returning from <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> program where they flew on <a href="Skylab%204">Skylab 4</a>.


The insignia of Apollo 16 is dominated by a rendering of an <a href="Bald%20eagle">American eagle</a> and a red, white and blue shield, representing the people of the United States, over a gray background representing the lunar surface. Overlaying the shield is a gold NASA vector, orbiting the Moon. On its gold-outlined blue border, there are 16 stars, representing the mission number, and the names of the crew members: Young, Mattingly, Duke. The insignia was designed from ideas originally submitted by the crew of the mission.

Apollo 16 was the second of the Apollo type J missions, featuring the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days. As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a>) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a>, obtained samples of pre-<a href="Lunar%20mare">mare</a> lunar material, before <a href="lava">lava</a> began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.

Apollo 14 had visited and sampled a ridge of material that had been ejected by the impact that created the <a href="Mare%20Imbrium">Mare Imbrium impact basin</a>. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material in the region of Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by <a href="Volcanism">volcanic</a> processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.

Two locations on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the <a href="Descartes%20Highlands">Descartes Highlands</a> region west of <a href="Mare%20Nectaris">Mare Nectaris</a> and the crater <a href="Alphonsus%20%28crater%29">Alphonsus</a>. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations were the primary areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more <a href="Viscosity">viscous</a> than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated to be about the same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a>.

At the Alphonsus, three scientific objectives were determined to be of primary interest and paramount importance: the possibility of old, pre-Imbrium impact material from within the crater's wall, the composition of the crater's interior and the possibility of past volcanic activity on the floor of the crater at several smaller "dark halo" craters. Geologists feared, however, that samples obtained from the crater might have been contaminated by the Imbrium impact, thus preventing Apollo 16 from obtaining samples of pre-Imbrium material. There also remained the distinct possibility that this objective had already been satisfied by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions, as the Apollo 14 samples had not yet been completely analyzed and samples from Apollo 15 had not yet been obtained.

It was decided to target the Apollo 16 mission for the Descartes site. Following the decision, the Alphonsus site was considered the most likely candidate for Apollo 17, but was eventually rejected. With the assistance of orbital photography obtained on the Apollo 14 mission, the Descartes site was determined to be safe enough for a manned landing. The specific landing site was between two young impact craters, <a href="North%20Ray%20%28crater%29">North Ray</a> and <a href="South%20Ray%20%28crater%29">South Ray</a> craters – in diameter, respectively – which provided "natural drill holes" which penetrated through the lunar <a href="regolith">regolith</a> at the site, thus leaving exposed <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> that could be sampled by the crew.

After selecting the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic units of the lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners to be the primary sampling interest of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from the mission.

In preparing for their mission, in addition to the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a>, underwent an extensive <a href="geology">geological</a> training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. During these trips, they visited and provided scientific descriptions of geologic features they were likely to encounter. In July 1971, they visited <a href="Greater%20Sudbury">Sudbury</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts did so. Geologists chose the area because of a wide crater created about 1.8 billion years ago by a large meteorite. The Sudbury Basin shows evidence of shatter cone geology familiarizing the Apollo crew with geologic evidence of a meteor impact. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">space suits</a>, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and scientist-astronaut <a href="Anthony%20W.%20England">Anthony W. England</a>, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.

In addition to the field geology training, Young and Duke also trained to use their EVA space suits, adapt to the reduced lunar gravity, collect samples, and drive the Lunar Roving Vehicle. They also received survival training and preparation for other technical aspects of the mission.

Command Module pilot Mattingly also received training in recognizing geological features from orbit by flying over the field areas in an airplane, and trained to operate the Scientific Instrument Module from lunar orbit.

The launch of Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This was the first launch delay in the Apollo program due to a technical problem. During the delay, the space suits, a <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> separation mechanism and batteries in the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command Module</a> (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in the capacity of the Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the <a href="Vehicle%20Assembly%20Building">Vertical Assembly Building</a> (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.

The official mission countdown began on Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six days before the launch. At this point the <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises in anticipation of a launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11. On April 15, <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a> and <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.

The Apollo 16 mission launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972. The launch was nominal; the crew experienced vibration similar to that of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket performed nominally; the spacecraft entered <a href="Low%20earth%20orbit">orbit</a> around Earth just under 12 minutes after lift-off. After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for <a href="Trans-lunar%20injection">Trans Lunar Injection</a> (TLI), the burn of the third-stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage's attitude control system, but eventually resolved or compensated for them as they prepared to depart towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at about . Six minutes after the burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB. Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the docking tunnel connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie "barbecue" mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even heat distribution about the spacecraft from the Sun. After further preparing the craft for the voyage, the crew began the first sleep period of the mission just under 15 hours after launch.

By the time <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center">Mission Control</a> issued the wake-up call to the crew for flight day two, the spacecraft was about away from the Earth, traveling at about . As it was not due to arrive in lunar orbit until flight day four, flight days two and three were largely preparatory days, consisting of spacecraft maintenance and scientific research. On day two, the crew performed an <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which they attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Propulsion%20System">Service Propulsion System</a> engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module for the second time in the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite this, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the <a href="Lunar%20orbit">Lunar Orbit Insertion</a> burn. Command Module Pilot Mattingly reported a "<a href="gimbal%20lock">gimbal lock</a>" warning light, indicating the craft was not reporting an <a href="Attitude%20%28aircraft%29">attitude</a>. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon. At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about away from Earth.

At the beginning of day three, the spacecraft was about away from the Earth. The velocity of the craft steadily decreased, as it had not yet reached the lunar sphere of gravitational influence. The early part of day three was largely housekeeping, spacecraft maintenance and exchanging status reports with Mission Control in Houston. The crew performed the Apollo light flash experiment, or ALFMED, to investigate "light flashes" that were seen by the astronauts when the spacecraft was dark, regardless of whether or not their eyes were open, on Apollo lunar flights. This was thought to be caused by the penetration of the <a href="Human%20eye">eye</a> by <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a> particles. During the second half of the day, Young and Duke again entered the Lunar Module to power it up and check its systems, and perform housekeeping tasks in preparation for lunar landing. The systems were found to be functioning as expected. Following this, the crew donned their space suits and rehearsed procedures that would be used on landing day. Just before the end of flight day three at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds after liftoff, while from the Earth and from the Moon, the spacecraft's velocity began increasing as it accelerated towards the Moon after entering the lunar sphere of influence.

After waking up on flight day four, the crew began preparations for the maneuver that would brake the spacecraft into orbit around the Moon, or lunar orbit insertion. At a distance of from the Moon, the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Scientific Instrument Module</a> (SIM) bay cover was jettisoned. At just over 74 hours into the mission, the spacecraft passed behind the Moon, losing direct contact with Mission Control. While over the <a href="far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">far side of the Moon</a>, the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine burned for 6 minutes and 15 seconds, braking the spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon with a low point (pericynthion) of 58.3 and a high point (apocynthion) of 170.4 nautical miles (108.0 and 315.6 km, respectively). After entering lunar orbit, the crew began preparations for the Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) maneuver to further modify the spacecraft's orbital trajectory. The maneuver was successful, decreasing the craft's pericynthion to . The remainder of flight day four was spent making observations and preparing for activation of the Lunar Module, undocking, and landing the next day.

The crew continued preparing for Lunar Module activation and undocking shortly after waking up to begin flight day five. The boom that extended the <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometer</a> out from the Command/Service Module's Scientific Instruments Bay was stuck in a semi-deployed position. It was decided that Young and Duke would visually inspect the boom after undocking from the CSM in the LM. They entered the LM for activation and checkout of the spacecraft's systems. Despite entering the LM 40 minutes ahead of schedule, they completed preparations only 10 minutes early due to numerous delays in the process. With the preparations finished, they undocked in the LM "Orion" from Mattingly in the Command/Service Module "Casper" 96 hours, 13 minutes, 13 seconds into the mission. For the rest of the two crafts' passes over the <a href="near%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">near side of the Moon</a>, Mattingly prepared to shift "Casper" to a circular orbit while Young and Duke prepared "Orion" for the descent to the lunar surface. At this point, during tests of the CSM's steerable rocket engine in preparation for the burn to modify the craft's orbit, a malfunction occurred in the engine's backup system. According to mission rules, "Orion" would have then re-docked with "Casper", in case Mission Control decided to abort the landing and use the Lunar Module's engines for the return trip to Earth. After several hours of analysis, however, mission controllers determined that the malfunction could be worked around and Young and Duke could proceed with the landing. As a result of this, powered descent to the lunar surface began about six hours behind schedule. Because of the delay, Young and Duke began their descent to the surface at an altitude higher than that of any previous mission, at . At an altitude of about , Young was able to view the landing site in its entirety. Throttle-down of the LM's landing engine occurred on time and the spacecraft tilted forward to its landing orientation at an altitude of . The LM landed north and west of the planned landing site at 104 hours, 29 minutes, and 35 seconds into the mission, at 2:23:35 UTC on April 21.

After landing, Young and Duke began powering down some of the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured "Orion" for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.

The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate breakfast and began preparations for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the "porch" of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human to walk on the Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' <a href="Brer%20Rabbit">Brer Rabbit</a>, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, <a href="Anthony%20W.%20England">Tony</a>!" The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the <a href="Far%20Ultraviolet%20Camera/Spectrograph">Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph</a> (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">flag of the United States</a> with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module "Aquarius" on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a crater on the rim of <a href="Flag%20%28crater%29">Flag crater</a>, about across. There, at a distance of from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper <a href="regolith">regolith</a> layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a <a href="breccia">breccia</a> nicknamed <a href="Big%20Muley">Big Muley</a> after mission geology principal investigator <a href="William%20R.%20Muehlberger">William R. Muehlberger</a>. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm</a> movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.

Shortly after waking up on the morning of flight day six three and a half minutes early, they discussed with Mission Control in Houston the day's timeline of events. The second lunar excursion's primary objective was to visit Stone Mountain to climb up the slope of about 20 degrees to reach a cluster of five craters known as "Cinco Craters." After preparations for the day's moonwalk were completed, the astronauts climbed out of the Lunar Module. After departing the immediate landing site in the lunar rover, they arrived at the day's first destination, the <a href="Cinco%20%28crater%29">Cinco</a> Craters, from the LM. At above the valley floor, the pair were at the highest elevation above the LM of any Apollo mission. After marveling at the view (including <a href="South%20Ray%20%28crater%29">South Ray</a>) from the side of Stone Mountain, which Duke described as "spectacular," the astronauts gathered samples in the vicinity. After spending 54 minutes on the slope, they climbed aboard the lunar rover en route to the day's second stop, station five, a crater across. There, they hoped to find Descartes material that had not been contaminated by ejecta from South Ray Crater, a large crater south of the landing site. The samples they collected there, although their origin is still not certain, are, according to geologist <a href="Donald%20Wilhelms">Don Wilhelms</a>, "a reasonable bet to be Descartes." The next stop, station six, was a blocky crater, where the astronauts believed they could sample the Cayley Formation as evidenced by the firmer soil found there. Bypassing station seven to save time, they arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. There, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, <a href="crystal">crystal</a>line rocks rich in <a href="plagioclase">plagioclase</a>. At station nine, an area known as the "Vacant Lot," which was believed to be free of ejecta from <a href="South%20Ray%20%28crater%29">South Ray</a>, they spent about 40 minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, they arrived at the final stop of the day, halfway between the ALSEP site and the LM. There, they dug a double core and conducted several <a href="penetrometer">penetrometer</a> tests along a line stretching east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, they climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15. After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with Mission Control, they reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.

Flight day seven was their third and final day on the lunar surface, returning to orbit to rejoin Mattingly in the Command/Service Module following the day's moonwalk. During the third and final lunar excursion, they were to explore North Ray Crater, the largest of any of the craters any Apollo expedition had visited. After exiting "Orion", the pair drove the lunar rover away from the LM before adjusting their heading to travel to <a href="North%20Ray%20%28crater%29">North Ray</a> Crater. The drive was smoother than that of the previous day, as the craters were shallower and boulders were less abundant north of the immediate landing site. After passing <a href="Palmetto%20%28crater%29">Palmetto</a> crater, boulders gradually became larger and more abundant as they approached North Ray in the lunar rover. Upon arriving at the rim of <a href="North%20Ray%20%28crater%29">North Ray</a> crater, they were away from the LM. After their arrival, the duo took photographs of the wide and deep crater. They visited a large boulder, taller than a four-story building, which became known as 'House Rock'. Samples obtained from this boulder delivered the final blow to the pre-mission volcanic hypothesis, proving it incorrect. House Rock had numerous bullet hole-like marks where <a href="micrometeoroid">micrometeoroid</a>s from space had impacted the rock. About 1 hour and 22 minutes after arriving, they departed for station 13, a large boulder field about from North Ray. On the way, they set a lunar speed record, traveling at an estimated downhill. They arrived at a high boulder, which they called 'Shadow Rock'. Here, they sampled permanently shadowed soil. During this time, Mattingly was preparing the Command/Service Module in anticipation of their return approximately six hours later. After three hours and six minutes, they returned to the LM, where they completed several experiments and offloaded the rover. A short distance from the LM, Duke placed a photograph of his family and a <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> commemorative medallion on the surface. Young drove the rover to a point about east of the LM, known as the 'VIP site,' so its television camera, controlled remotely by Mission Control, could observe Apollo 16's liftoff from the Moon. They then reentered the LM after a 5-hour and 40 minute final excursion. After pressurizing the LM cabin, the crew began preparing to return to lunar orbit.

Eight minutes before departing the lunar surface, CAPCOM <a href="James%20Irwin">James Irwin</a> notified Young and Duke from Mission Control that they were go for liftoff. Two minutes before launch, they activated the "Master Arm" switch and then the "Abort Stage" button, after which they awaited ignition of "Orion"’s <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module%23Ascent%20stage">ascent stage</a> engine. When the ascent stage ignited, small explosive charges severed the ascent stage from the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module%23Descent%20stage">descent stage</a> and cables connecting the two were severed by a <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>-like mechanism. Six minutes after liftoff, at a speed of about , Young and Duke reached lunar orbit. Young and Duke successfully rendezvoused and re-docked with Mattingly in the Command/Service Module. To minimize the transfer of lunar dust from the LM cabin into the CSM, Young and Duke cleaned the cabin before opening the hatch separating the two spacecraft. After opening the hatch and reuniting with Mattingly, the crew transferred the samples Young and Duke had collected on the surface into the CSM for transfer to Earth. After transfers were completed, the crew would sleep before jettisoning the empty Lunar Module ascent stage the next day, when it was to be crashed intentionally into the lunar surface.

The next day, after final checks were completed, the expended LM ascent stage was jettisoned. Because of a failure by the crew to activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly a year after the mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.

At a distance of about from Earth, Mattingly performed a "deep-space" extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several film cassettes from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED). The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16. The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.

The penultimate day of the flight was largely spent performing experiments, aside from a twenty-minute press conference during the second half of the day. During the press conference, the astronauts answered questions pertaining to several technical and non-technical aspects of the mission prepared and listed by priority at the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> in Houston by journalists covering the flight. In addition to numerous housekeeping tasks, the astronauts prepared the spacecraft for its <a href="Atmospheric%20entry">atmospheric reentry</a> the next day. At the end of the crew's final full day in space, the spacecraft was approximately from Earth and closing at a rate of about .

When the wake-up call was issued to the crew for their final day in space by CAPCOM <a href="Anthony%20W.%20England">Tony England</a>, it was about out from Earth, traveling just over . Just over three hours before <a href="Splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">splashdown</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, the crew performed a final course correction burn, changing their velocity by . Approximately ten minutes before reentry into Earth's atmosphere, the cone-shaped Command Module containing the three crewmembers separated from the Service Module, which would burn up during reentry. At 265 hours and 37 minutes into the mission, at a velocity of about , Apollo 16 began atmospheric reentry. At its maximum, the temperature of the heat shield was between . After successful parachute deployment and less than 14 minutes after reentry began, the Command Module <a href="Splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">splashed down</a> in the Pacific Ocean southeast of the island of <a href="Kiritimati">Kiritimati</a> (or "Christmas Island"), 290 hours, 37 minutes, 6 seconds after liftoff. The spacecraft and its crew was retrieved by . They were safely aboard the "Ticonderoga" 37 minutes after splashdown.

The Apollo 16 subsatellite (PFS-2) was a small satellite released into lunar orbit from the Service Module. Its principal objective was to measure charged particles and magnetic fields all around the Moon as the Moon orbited Earth, similar to its sister spacecraft, <a href="PFS-1">PFS-1</a>, released eight months earlier by Apollo 15. "The low orbits of both subsatellites were to be similar ellipses, ranging from above the lunar surface."

"Instead, something bizarre happened. The orbit of PFS-2 rapidly changed shape and distance from the Moon. In 2-1/2 weeks the satellite was swooping to within a hair-raising of the lunar surface at closest approach. As the orbit kept changing, PFS-2 backed off again, until it seemed to be a safe 30 miles away. But not for long: inexorably, the subsatellite's orbit carried it back toward the Moon. And on May 29, 1972—only 35 days and 425 orbits after its release"—PFS-2 crashed into the Lunar surface.

In later years, through a study of many <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a>ing satellites, scientists came to discover that most <a href="Lunar%20orbit">low lunar orbit</a>s (LLO) are unstable. PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely into one of the most unstable of orbits, at 11 degrees <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>, far from the four "<a href="frozen%20orbit">frozen lunar orbits</a>" discovered only later at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.

The aircraft carrier USS "Ticonderoga" delivered the Apollo 16 Command Module to the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20North%20Island">North Island Naval Air Station</a>, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment being used to empty the residual toxic <a href="reaction%20control%20system">reaction control system</a> fuel in the Command Module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. Forty-six people were sent to the hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was blown in the hangar roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in the hangar were shattered. The Command Module suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.

The Apollo 16 Command Module "Casper" is on display at the <a href="U.S.%20Space%20%26amp%3B%20Rocket%20Center">U.S. Space & Rocket Center</a> in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>. The Lunar Module ascent stage separated 24 April 1972 but a loss of attitude control rendered it out of control. It orbited the Moon for about a year. Its impact site remains unknown. The S-IVB was deliberately crashed into the moon. However, due to a communication failure before impact the exact location was unknown until January 2016, when it was discovered within <a href="Mare%20Insularum">Mare Insularum</a> by the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a>, approximately southwest of <a href="Copernicus%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Copernicus Crater</a>.

Duke donated some flown items, including a lunar map, to <a href="Kennesaw%20State%20University">Kennesaw State University</a> in <a href="Kennesaw%2C%20Georgia">Kennesaw, Georgia</a>. He left two items on the Moon, both of which he photographed. The most famous is a plastic-encased photo portrait of his family (NASA Photo AS16-117-18841). The reverse of the photo is signed by Duke's family and bears this message: "This is the family of Astronaut Duke from Planet Earth. Landed on the Moon, April 1972." The other item was a commemorative medal issued by the United States Air Force, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1972. He took two medals, leaving one on the Moon and donating the other to the <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> museum.

In 2006, shortly after <a href="Hurricane%20Ernesto%20%282006%29">Hurricane Ernesto</a> affected <a href="Bath%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bath, North Carolina</a>, eleven-year-old Kevin Schanze discovered a piece of metal debris on the ground near his beach home. Schanze and a friend discovered a "stamp" on the flat metal sheet, which upon further inspection turned out to be a faded copy of the Apollo 16 mission insignia. NASA later confirmed the object to be a piece of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that launched Apollo 16 into space. In July 2011, after returning the piece of debris at NASA's request, 16-year-old Schanze was given an all-access tour of the Kennedy Space Center and VIP seating for the launch of <a href="STS-135">STS-135</a>, the final mission of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20program">Space Shuttle program</a>.

Apollo 17

Apollo 17 was the final mission of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Apollo%20program">Apollo program</a>. Launched at 12:33 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, with a crew made up of Commander <a href="Eugene%20Cernan">Eugene Cernan</a>, <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command Module</a> Pilot <a href="Ronald%20Evans%20%28astronaut%29">Ronald Evans</a>, and <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> Pilot <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a>, it was the last use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose; after Apollo 17, extra <a href="Apollo%20%28spacecraft%29">Apollo spacecraft</a> were used in the <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> and <a href="Apollo%E2%80%93Soyuz%20Test%20Project">Apollo–Soyuz</a> programs.

Apollo 17 was the first night launch of a U.S. human spaceflight and the final manned launch of a <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket. It was a "<a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">J-type mission</a>" which included three days on the lunar surface, extended scientific capability, and the third <a href="Lunar%20Roving%20Vehicle">Lunar Roving Vehicle</a> (LRV). While Evans remained in <a href="lunar%20orbit">lunar orbit</a> in the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Command/Service Module</a> (CSM), Cernan and Schmitt spent just over three days on the moon in the <a href="Taurus%E2%80%93Littrow">Taurus–Littrow</a> valley and completed three <a href="extra-vehicular%20activity">moonwalks</a>, taking <a href="Moon%20rock">lunar samples</a> and deploying <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">scientific instruments</a>. Evans took scientific measurements and photographs from orbit using a Scientific Instruments Module mounted in the Service Module.

The landing site was chosen with the primary objectives of Apollo 17 in mind: to sample <a href="Lunar%20highlands">lunar highland</a> material older than the impact that formed <a href="Mare%20Imbrium">Mare Imbrium</a>, and investigate the possibility of relatively new <a href="Volcano">volcanic activity</a> in the same area. Cernan, Evans and Schmitt returned to Earth on December 19 after a 12-day mission.

Apollo 17 is the most recent manned <a href="Moon%20landing">Moon landing</a> and was the last time humans travelled beyond <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>. It was also the first mission to be commanded by a person with no background as a <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>, and the first to have no one on board who had been a test pilot; <a href="X-15">X-15</a> test pilot <a href="Joe%20Engle">Joe Engle</a> lost the lunar module pilot assignment to Schmitt, a scientist. The mission broke several records: the longest moon landing, longest total extravehicular activities (moonwalks), largest lunar sample, and longest time in lunar orbit.

Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and former <a href="North%20American%20X-15">X-15</a> pilot <a href="Joe%20Engle">Joe Engle</a> were assigned to the backup crew of <a href="Apollo%2014">Apollo 14</a>. Engle flew sixteen X-15 flights, three of which exceeded the border of space. Following the rotation pattern that a backup crew would fly as the prime crew three missions later, Cernan, Evans, and Engle would have flown Apollo 17. Harrison Schmitt served on the backup crew of <a href="Apollo%2015">Apollo 15</a> and, following the crew rotation cycle, was slated to fly as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 18. However, <a href="Canceled%20Apollo%20missions">Apollo 18 was cancelled</a> in September 1970. Following this decision, the scientific community pressured <a href="NASA">NASA</a> to assign a <a href="geologist">geologist</a> to an Apollo landing, as opposed to a pilot trained in geology. In light of this pressure, Harrison Schmitt, a professional geologist, was assigned the Lunar Module Pilot position on Apollo 17. Scientist-astronaut <a href="Curt%20Michel">Curt Michel</a> believed that it was his own decision to resign, after it became clear that he would not be given a flight assignment, that mobilized this action.

Subsequent to the decision to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17, there remained the question of which crew (the full backup crew of Apollo 15, <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%2C%20Jr.">Dick Gordon</a>, <a href="Vance%20D.%20Brand">Vance Brand</a>, and Schmitt, or the backup crew of Apollo 14) would become prime crew of the mission. NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a> ultimately assigned the backup crew of Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans), along with Schmitt, to the prime crew of Apollo 17.

The Apollo 15 prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission. However, when the <a href="Apollo%2015%20postage%20stamp%20incident">Apollo 15 postage stamp incident</a> became public in early 1972 the crew was reprimanded by NASA and the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (they were active duty officers). Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with Young and Duke from the <a href="Apollo%2016">Apollo 16</a> prime crew and Roosa from the Apollo 14 prime and Apollo 16 backup crews.


The insignia's most prominent feature is an image of the Greek sun god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> backdropped by a rendering of an <a href="Bald%20eagle">American eagle</a>, the red bars on the eagle mirroring those on the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">flag of the United States</a>. Three white stars above the red bars represent the three crewmen of the mission. The background includes the Moon, the planet <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> and a galaxy or nebula. The wing of the eagle partially overlays the Moon, suggesting man's established presence there. The gaze of Apollo and the direction of the eagle's motion embody man's intention to explore further destinations in space.

The patch includes, along with the colors of the U.S. flag (red, white, and blue), the color gold, representative of a "golden age" of spaceflight that was to begin with Apollo 17. The image of Apollo in the mission insignia is a rendering of the "<a href="Apollo%20Belvedere">Apollo Belvedere</a>" sculpture. The insignia was designed by <a href="Robert%20McCall%20%28artist%29">Robert McCall</a>, with input from the crew.

Like Apollo 15 and Apollo 16, Apollo 17 was slated to be a "<a href="List%20of%20Apollo%20mission%20types">J-mission</a>," an Apollo mission type that featured lunar surface stays of three days, higher scientific capability, and the usage of the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Since Apollo 17 was to be the final lunar landing of the Apollo program, high-priority landing sites that had not been visited previously were given consideration for potential exploration. A landing in the crater <a href="Copernicus%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Copernicus</a> was considered, but was ultimately rejected because <a href="Apollo%2012">Apollo 12</a> had already obtained samples from that impact, and three other Apollo expeditions had already visited the vicinity of Mare Imbrium. A landing in the lunar highlands near the crater <a href="Tycho%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Tycho</a> was also considered, but was rejected because of the rough terrain found there and a landing on the <a href="Far%20side%20of%20the%20Moon">lunar far side</a> in the crater <a href="Tsiolkovskiy%20%28crater%29">Tsiolkovskiy</a> was rejected due to technical considerations and the operational costs of maintaining communication during surface operations. A landing in a region southwest of <a href="Mare%20Crisium">Mare Crisium</a> was also considered, but rejected on the grounds that a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> spacecraft could easily access the site; <a href="Luna%2021">Luna 21</a> eventually did so shortly after the Apollo 17 site selection was made.

After the elimination of several sites, three sites made the final consideration for Apollo 17: <a href="Alphonsus%20%28crater%29">Alphonsus crater</a>, <a href="Gassendi%20%28crater%29">Gassendi crater</a>, and the Taurus-Littrow valley. In making the final landing site decision, mission planners took into consideration the primary objectives for Apollo 17: obtaining old highlands material from a substantial distance from Mare Imbrium, sampling material from young volcanic activity (i.e., less than three billion years), and having minimal ground overlap with the orbital ground tracks of Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 to maximize the amount of new data obtained.

The Taurus-Littrow site was selected with the prediction that the crew would be able to obtain samples of old highland material from the remnants of a landslide event that occurred on the south wall of the valley and the possibility of relatively young, explosive volcanic activity in the area. Although the valley is similar to the <a href="Hadley%E2%80%93Apennine%20%28Moon%29">landing site of Apollo 15</a> in that it is on the border of a <a href="lunar%20mare">lunar mare</a>, the advantages of Taurus-Littrow were believed to outweigh the drawbacks, thus leading to its selection as the Apollo 17 landing site.

Apollo 17 was the only lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse <a href="Gravimeter">Gravimeter</a> Experiment (TGE), an experiment built by <a href="Charles%20Stark%20Draper%20Laboratory">Draper Laboratory</a> at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> designed to provide relative gravity measurements throughout the landing site at various locations during the mission's moonwalks. Scientists would then use this data to gather information about the geological substructure of the landing site and the surrounding vicinity.

As with previous lunar landings, the Apollo 17 astronauts underwent an extensive training program that included training to collect samples on the surface, usage of the <a href="Apollo/Skylab%20A7L">spacesuits</a>, navigation in the Lunar Roving Vehicle, field geology training, survival training, <a href="Splashdown%20%28spacecraft%20landing%29">splashdown</a> and recovery training, and equipment training.

Apollo 17 was the only Apollo lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse Gravimeter Experiment. As gravimeters had proven to be useful in the geologic investigation of the Earth, the objective of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of using the same techniques on the Moon to learn about its internal structure. The gravimeter was used to obtain readings at the landing site in the immediate vicinity of the Lunar Module (LM), as well as various locations on the mission's traverse routes. The TGE was carried on the Lunar Roving Vehicle; measurements were taken by the astronauts while the LRV was not in motion or after the gravimeter was placed on the surface.

A total of twenty-six measurements were taken with the TGE during the mission's three moonwalks, with productive results. As part of the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP), the astronauts also deployed the Lunar Surface Gravimeter, a similar experiment, which ultimately failed to function properly.

Sector one of the Apollo 17 <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module%23Service%20Module%20%28SM%29">Service Module</a> (SM) contained the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay. The SIM bay housed three experiments for use in lunar orbit: a lunar sounder, an <a href="infrared">infrared</a> scanning <a href="radiometer">radiometer</a>, and a <a href="Ultraviolet">far-ultraviolet</a> spectrometer. A mapping camera, panoramic camera, and a <a href="Lidar">laser altimeter</a> were also included in the SIM bay.

The lunar sounder beamed <a href="Electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic</a> impulses toward the lunar surface, which were designed with the objective of obtaining data to assist in developing a geological model of the interior of the Moon to an approximate depth of .

The Infrared Scanning Radiometer was designed with the objective of generating a temperature map of the lunar surface to aid in locating surface features such as rock fields, structural differences in the <a href="Internal%20structure%20of%20the%20Moon">lunar crust</a>, and volcanic activity.

The Far-Ultraviolet Spectrometer was to be used to obtain data pertaining to the composition, density, and constituency of the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20the%20Moon">lunar atmosphere</a>. The spectrometer was also designed to detect far-UV radiation emitted by the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> that has been reflected off the lunar surface.

The Laser Altimeter was designed with the intention of measuring the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface within approximately , and providing altitude information to the panoramic and mapping cameras.

Throughout the Apollo lunar missions, the crew members observed light flashes that penetrated closed eyelids. These flashes, described as "streaks" or "specks" of light, were usually observed by astronauts while the spacecraft was darkened during a sleep period. These flashes, while not observed on the lunar surface, would average about two per minute and were observed by the crew members during the trip out to the Moon, back to Earth, and in lunar orbit.

The Apollo 17 crew conducted an experiment, also conducted on Apollo 16, with the objective of linking these light flashes with <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. As part of an experiment conducted by NASA and the <a href="University%20of%20Houston">University of Houston</a>, one astronaut wore a device that recorded the time, strength, and path of high-energy atomic particles that penetrated the device. Analysis of the results concluded that the evidence supported the hypothesis that the flashes occurred when charged particles travelled through the <a href="retina">retina</a> in the eye.

Apollo 17 was the only lunar surface expedition to include the Surface Electrical Properties (SEP) experiment. The experiment included two major components: a transmitting antenna deployed near the Lunar Module and a receiving antenna located on the Lunar Roving Vehicle. At different stops during the mission's traverses, electrical signals traveled from the transmitting device, through the ground, and received at the LRV. The electrical properties of the <a href="lunar%20soil">lunar soil</a> could be determined by comparison of the transmitted and received electrical signals. The results of this experiment, which are consistent with <a href="Moon%20rock">lunar rock</a> composition, show that the top of the Moon are extremely dry.

Apollo 17 was the third mission (the others being Apollo 15 and Apollo 16) to make use of a Lunar Roving Vehicle. The LRV, in addition to being used by the astronauts for transport from station to station on the mission's three moonwalks, was used to transport the astronauts' tools, communications equipment, and samples. The Apollo 17 LRV was also used to carry experiments unique to the mission, such as the Traverse Gravimeter and Surface Electrical Properties experiment. The Apollo 17 LRV traveled a cumulative distance of approximately in a total drive time of about four hours and twenty-six minutes; the greatest distance Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt traveled from the Lunar Module was about .

Apollo 17 included a biological cosmic ray experiment (BIOCORE), carrying mice that had been implanted with radiation monitors to see whether they suffered damage from cosmic rays.

Five pocket mice ("<a href="Perognathus%20longimembris">Perognathus longimembris</a>") were implanted with radiation monitors under their scalps and flown on the mission. The species was chosen because it was well-documented, small, easy to maintain in an isolated state (not requiring drinking water for the duration of the mission and with highly concentrated waste), and for its ability to withstand environmental stress. Four of the five mice survived the flight; the cause of death of the fifth mouse was not determined.

The study found <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s in the scalp itself and liver. The scalp lesions and liver lesions appeared to be unrelated to one another, and were not thought to be the result of cosmic rays. No damage was found in the mice's retinas or viscera. At the time of the publication of the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report, the mouse brains had not yet been examined. However, subsequent studies showed no significant effect on the brains.

Officially, the mice—four male and one female—were assigned the identification numbers A3326, A3400, A3305, A3356 and A3352. Unofficially, according to Cernan, the Apollo 17 crew dubbed them "Fe", "Fi", "Fo", "Fum" and "Phooey".

Apollo 17 was the last manned Saturn V launch and the only night launch. The launch was delayed by two hours and forty minutes due to an automatic cutoff in the launch sequencer at the T-30 second mark in the countdown. The issue was quickly determined to be a minor technical error. The clock was reset and held at the T-22 minute mark while technicians worked around the malfunction in order to continue with the launch. This pause was the only launch delay in the Apollo program caused by this type of hardware failure. The count then resumed, and the liftoff occurred at 12:33 am <a href="Eastern%20Standard%20Time%20%28North%20America%29">EST</a>.

Approximately 500,000 people were estimated to have observed the launch in the immediate vicinity of Kennedy Space Center, despite the early morning hour. The launch was visible as far away as ; observers in <a href="Miami">Miami, Florida</a>, saw a "red streak" crossing the northern sky.

At 3:46 am EST, the <a href="S-IVB">S-IVB</a> third stage was <a href="Trans-lunar%20injection">re-ignited</a> to propel the spacecraft towards the Moon.

At approximately 2:47 pm EST on December 10, the <a href="Service%20Propulsion%20System">Service Propulsion System</a> engine on the Command/Service Module ignited to slow down the CSM/Lunar Module stack into lunar orbit. Following orbit insertion and orbital stabilization, the crew began preparations for landing in the Taurus-Littrow valley.

After separating from the Command/Service Module, the Lunar Module "Challenger" and its crew of two, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, adjusted their orbit and began preparations for the descent to Taurus-Littrow. While Cernan and Schmitt prepared for landing, Command Module Pilot Ron Evans remained in orbit to take observations, perform experiments and await the return of his crew-mates a few days later.

Soon after completing their preparations for landing, Cernan and Schmitt began their descent to the Taurus-Littrow valley on the lunar surface. Several minutes after the descent phase was initiated, the Lunar Module pitched over, giving the crew their first look at the landing site during the descent phase and allowing Cernan to guide the spacecraft to a desirable landing target while Schmitt provided data from the flight computer essential for landing. The LM touched down on the lunar surface at 2:55 pm EST on December 11. Shortly thereafter, the two astronauts began re-configuring the LM for their stay on the surface and began preparations for the first moonwalk of the mission, or EVA-1.

The first moonwalk (<a href="Extra-vehicular%20activity">EVA</a>) of the mission began approximately four hours after landing, at about 6:55 pm on December 11. The first task of the first lunar excursion was to offload the Lunar Roving Vehicle and other equipment from the Lunar Module. While working near the rover, a fender was accidentally broken off when Gene Cernan brushed up against it, his hammer getting caught under the right-rear fender, breaking off the rear extension. The same incident had also occurred on Apollo 16 as Commander <a href="John%20Young%20%28astronaut%29">John Young</a> maneuvered around the rover. Although this was not a mission-critical issue, the loss of the fender caused Cernan and Schmitt to be covered with dust thrown up when the rover was in motion. The crew used <a href="duct%20tape">duct tape</a> to fix the problem by attaching a map to the damaged fender, but the dust picked up on the tape surface prevented it from sticking properly and the first fix was short lived. After an overnight rethink by the <a href="flight%20controller">flight controller</a>s, a better method of applying the tape resulted in a satisfactory fix that lasted for the length of the exploration. The crew then deployed the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package</a> (ALSEP) west of the immediate landing site. After completing this, Cernan and Schmitt departed on the first geologic traverse of the mission towards <a href="Steno-Apollo%20%28crater%29">Steno</a> crater to the south of the landing site, during which they gathered of samples; took seven gravimeter measurements; and deployed two explosive packages, which were later detonated remotely to test <a href="geophone">geophone</a>s that had been placed by the astronauts and <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a>s that had been placed on previous Apollo missions. The EVA ended after seven hours and twelve minutes.

On December 12, at 6:28 pm EST, Cernan and Schmitt began their second lunar excursion. One of the first tasks of the EVA was repairing the right-rear fender on the LRV, the rearward extension of which had been broken off the previous day. The pair did this by taping together four cronopaque maps with duct tape and clamping the replacement fender extension to the fender, thus providing a means of preventing dust from raining down upon them while in motion. During this EVA, the pair sampled several different types of geologic deposits found in the valley, including the avalanche at the base of the South Massif, orange-colored soil at <a href="Shorty%20%28crater%29">Shorty crater</a>, and <a href="ejecta">ejecta</a> of <a href="Camelot%20%28crater%29">Camelot crater</a>. The crew completed this moonwalk after seven hours and thirty-seven minutes. They collected of samples, deployed three more explosive packages and took seven gravimeter measurements.

The third moonwalk, the last of the Apollo program, began at 5:26 pm EST on December 13. During this excursion, the crew collected of lunar samples and took nine gravimeter measurements. They drove the rover to the north and east of the landing site and explored the base of the North Massif, the Sculptured Hills, and the unusual crater <a href="Van%20Serg%20%28crater%29">Van Serg</a>. Before ending the moonwalk, the crew collected a rock, a <a href="breccia">breccia</a>, and dedicated it to several different nations which were represented in <a href="Christopher%20C.%20Kraft%20Jr.%20Mission%20Control%20Center%23Houston%20%281965%E2%80%93present%29">Mission Control Center</a> in <a href="Houston">Houston, Texas</a>, at the time. A plaque located on the Lunar Module, commemorating the achievements made during the Apollo program, was then unveiled. Before reentering the LM for the final time, Gene Cernan expressed his thoughts:

Cernan then followed Schmitt into the Lunar Module after spending approximately seven hours and 15 minutes outside during the mission's final lunar excursion.

Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt successfully lifted off from the lunar surface in the ascent stage of the Lunar Module on December 14, at 5:55 pm EST. After a successful rendezvous and docking with Ron Evans in the Command/Service Module in orbit, the crew transferred equipment and lunar samples between the LM and the CSM for return to Earth. Following this, the LM ascent stage was sealed off and jettisoned at 1:31 am on December 15. The ascent stage was then deliberately crashed into the Moon in a collision recorded by <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a>s deployed on Apollo 17 and previous Apollo expeditions.

On December 17, during the trip back to Earth, at 3:27 pm EST, Ron Evans successfully conducted a one-hour and seven minute spacewalk to retrieve exposed film from the instrument bay on the exterior of the CSM.

On December 19, the crew jettisoned the no-longer-needed Service Module, leaving only the Command Module for return to Earth. The Apollo 17 spacecraft <a href="Atmospheric%20entry">reentered Earth's atmosphere</a> and landed safely in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> at 2:25 pm, from the recovery ship, . Cernan, Evans and Schmitt were then retrieved by a recovery helicopter and were safely aboard the recovery ship 52 minutes after landing.

The Command Module "America" is currently on display at <a href="Space%20Center%20Houston">Space Center Houston</a> at the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center</a> in Houston, Texas.

The ascent stage of lunar module "Challenger" impacted the Moon December 15, 1972 at 06:50:20.8 UT (1:50 am EST), at . The descent stage remains on the Moon at the landing site, .

In 2009 and again in 2011, the <a href="Lunar%20Reconnaissance%20Orbiter">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> photographed the landing site from increasingly low orbits.

Portions of the Apollo 17 mission are dramatized in the 1998 <a href="HBO">HBO</a> miniseries "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29">From the Earth to the Moon</a>" episode entitled <a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon%20%28miniseries%29%23Episodes">"Le Voyage dans la Lune."</a>

The prologue to the 1999 novel "<a href="Back%20to%20the%20Moon">Back to the Moon</a>", by <a href="Homer%20Hickam">Homer Hickam</a>, begins with a dramatized depiction of the end of the second Apollo 17 EVA. The orange soil then becomes the major driver of the plot of the rest of the story.

The 2005 novel "<a href="Tyrannosaur%20Canyon">Tyrannosaur Canyon</a>" by <a href="Douglas%20Preston">Douglas Preston</a> opens with a depiction of the Apollo 17 moonwalks using quotes taken from the official mission transcript.

Additionally, there have been fictional astronauts in film, literature and television who have been described as "the last man to walk on the Moon," implying they were crew members on Apollo 17. One such character was <a href="Steve%20Austin%20%28fictional%20character%29">Steve Austin</a> in the television series "<a href="The%20Six%20Million%20Dollar%20Man">The Six Million Dollar Man</a>". In the 1972 novel "<a href="Cyborg%20%28novel%29">Cyborg</a>", upon which the series was based, Austin remembers watching the Earth "fall away during Apollo XVII." In the 1998 film "<a href="Deep%20Impact%20%28film%29">Deep Impact</a>" fictional astronaut Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner, portrayed by <a href="Robert%20Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>, was described at a Presidential press conference as the "last man to walk on the moon" by the President of the United States, portrayed by <a href="Morgan%20Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>.

In the Anime <a href="Aldnoah.Zero">Aldnoah.Zero</a>, the Apollo 17 mission locates an ancient transporter gate leading to Mars left by an unknown, extinct alien race. This discovery is the divergence point for the story's alternate history.

American Revolution

The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> won independence from Great Britain, becoming the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>. They defeated the British in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> in alliance with France and others.

Members of <a href="Colonial%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">American colonial society</a> argued the position of "<a href="no%20taxation%20without%20representation">no taxation without representation</a>", starting with the <a href="Stamp%20Act%20Congress">Stamp Act Congress</a> in 1765. They rejected the authority of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">the British Parliament</a> to tax them because they lacked representation in Parliament. Protests steadily escalated to the <a href="Gaspee%20Affair">burning of the "Gaspee"</a> in <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a> in 1772, followed by the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a> in 1773, during which patriots destroyed a consignment of taxed tea. The British responded by closing Boston Harbor, then followed with a <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">series of legislative acts</a> which effectively rescinded <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>'s rights of self-government and caused the other colonies to rally behind Massachusetts. In late 1774, the Patriots set up <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">their own alternative government</a> to better coordinate their resistance efforts against Great Britain; other colonists preferred to remain aligned to the British Crown and were known as <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> or Tories.

Tensions erupted into battle between Patriot militia and British regulars when the British attempted to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies at <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Lexington and Concord</a> in April 1775. The conflict then developed into a global war, during which the Patriots (and later their French, Spanish, and Dutch allies) fought the British and Loyalists in what became known as the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> (1775–83). Each of the thirteen colonies formed a <a href="Provincial%20Congress">Provincial Congress</a> that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> under the leadership of General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. The Continental Congress determined King George's rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists' <a href="Rights%20of%20Englishmen">rights as Englishmen</a>, and they declared the colonies <a href="Lee%20Resolution">free and independent states</a> on July 2, 1776. The Patriot leadership professed the political philosophies of <a href="Liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberalism</a> and <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicanism</a> to reject monarchy and aristocracy, and they proclaimed that all men are created equal.

The Continental Army forced the British out of Boston in 1776, but the British captured and held New York City for the duration of the war. The British blockaded ports and captured other cities for brief periods, but they failed to defeat Washington's forces. The Patriots unsuccessfully attempted to invade Canada during the winter of 1775–76, but they captured a British army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a> in late 1777, and the French entered the war as allies of the United States as a result. The war later turned to the American South where the British under the leadership of <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a> captured an army at <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> but failed to enlist enough volunteers from Loyalist civilians to take effective control of the territory. A combined American–French force captured a second British army <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">at Yorktown</a> in 1781, effectively ending the war in the United States. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1783 formally ended the conflict, confirming the new nation's complete separation from the British Empire. The United States took possession of nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, with the British retaining control of Canada and Spain taking Florida.

Among the significant results of the revolution was the creation of a new <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution of the United States</a>. The new Constitution established a relatively strong federal national government that included an <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">executive</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">national judiciary</a>, and a bicameral <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congress</a> that represented states in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> and the population in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The Revolution also resulted in the migration of around 60,000 Loyalists to other British territories, especially British North America (Canada).

Historians typically begin their histories of the American Revolution with the British coalition victory in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> in 1763. The North American theater of the Seven Years' War, commonly known as the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> in the United States, removed France as a major player in North American affairs and led to the cession of the territory of <a href="New%20France">New France</a> to Great Britain. <a href="Lawrence%20Henry%20Gipson">Lawrence Henry Gipson</a>, the historian of the British Empire, states:

The <a href="Royal%20Proclamation%20of%201763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a> may have played a role in the separation of the United States from Great Britain, as colonists at the time wanted to continue in the economically beneficial cultural practice of taking land for one's own livelihood as part of the drive west. The lands west of Quebec and west of a line running along the crest of the <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Allegheny mountains</a> became Indian territory, temporarily barred to settlement.

As early as 1651, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">English government</a> had sought to regulate trade in the <a href="British%20America">American colonies</a>. On October 9, the <a href="Navigation%20Acts%23Navigation%20Act%201651">Navigation Acts</a> were passed to ensure that trade <a href="Mercantilism">enriched only Britain</a>, barring trade with other nations. Some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists, but the political friction which the acts triggered was more serious, as the merchants most directly affected were most politically active. <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a> ended in 1678, and much of it was fought without significant assistance from England. This contributed to the development of a unique identity, separate from that of <a href="Britishness">Britain</a>.

In the 1680s, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a> determined to bring the <a href="New%20England%20colonies">New England colonies</a> under a more centralized administration in order to regulate trade more effectively. His efforts were fiercely opposed by the colonists, resulting in the abrogation of their colonial charter by the Crown. Charles' successor <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> finalized these efforts in 1686, establishing the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>. Dominion rule triggered bitter resentment throughout New England; the enforcement of the unpopular Navigation Acts and the curtailing of local democracy angered the colonists. New Englanders were encouraged, however, by a <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">change of government in England</a> that saw James II effectively <a href="abdicate">abdicate</a>, and a <a href="1689%20Boston%20revolt">populist uprising</a> overthrew Dominion rule on April 18, 1689. Colonial governments reasserted their control in the wake of the revolt, and successive governments made no more attempts to restore the Dominion.

Subsequent English governments continued in their efforts to tax certain goods, passing acts regulating the trade of <a href="Wool%20Act%201699">wool</a>, <a href="Hat%20Act">hats</a>, and <a href="Molasses%20Act">molasses</a>. The Molasses Act of 1733 in particular was egregious to the colonists, as a significant part of colonial trade relied on the product. The taxes severely damaged the New England economy, and the taxes were rarely paid as a result, resulting in a surge of smuggling, bribery, and intimidation of customs officials. Colonial wars fought in America were often the source of considerable tension. The British captured the fortress of <a href="Louisbourg">Louisbourg</a> during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, but then ceded it back to France in 1748. New England colonists resented their losses of lives, as well as the effort and expenditure involved in subduing the fortress, only to have it returned to their erstwhile enemy.

In 1764, Parliament passed the Currency Act to restrain the use of paper money, fearing that otherwise the colonists might evade debt payments. Parliament also passed the <a href="Sugar%20Act">Sugar Act</a>, imposing customs <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on a number of articles. That same year, Prime Minister <a href="George%20Grenville">George Grenville</a> proposed direct taxes on the colonies to raise revenue, but he delayed action to see whether the colonies would propose some way to raise the revenue themselves. Parliament finally passed the Stamp Act in March 1765 which imposed direct taxes on the colonies for the first time. All official documents, newspapers, almanacs, and pamphlets were required to have the stamps—even decks of playing cards.

The colonists did not object that the taxes were high; they were actually low. They objected to the fact that they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them. <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> alone. London had to deal with 1,500 politically well-connected British Army soldiers. The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were not there to defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.

The <a href="Sons%20of%20Liberty">Sons of Liberty</a> were formed in 1765. They used public demonstrations, <a href="boycott">boycott</a>, violence, and threats of violence to ensure that the British tax laws were unenforceable. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty burned the records of the <a href="vice%20admiralty%20court">vice admiralty court</a> and looted the home of chief justice <a href="Thomas%20Hutchinson%20%28governor%29">Thomas Hutchinson</a>. Several legislatures called for united action, and nine colonies sent delegates to the <a href="Stamp%20Act%20Congress">Stamp Act Congress</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in October 1765. Moderates led by <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28delegate%29">John Dickinson</a> drew up a "<a href="Declaration%20of%20Rights%20and%20Grievances">Declaration of Rights and Grievances</a>" stating that taxes passed without representation violated their <a href="Rights%20of%20Englishmen">rights as Englishmen</a>. Colonists emphasized their determination by boycotting imports of British merchandise.

The Parliament at Westminster saw itself as the supreme lawmaking authority throughout all British possessions and thus entitled to levy any tax without colonial approval. They argued that the colonies were legally British corporations that were completely subordinate to the British parliament and pointed to numerous instances where Parliament had made laws binding on the colonies in the past. They did not see anything in the unwritten British constitution that made taxes special and noted that they had taxed American trade for decades. Parliament insisted that the colonies effectively enjoyed a "<a href="virtual%20representation">virtual representation</a>" as most British people did, as only a small minority of the British population elected representatives to Parliament. Americans such as <a href="James%20Otis%2C%20Jr.">James Otis</a> maintained that the Americans were not in fact virtually represented.

In London, the <a href="Charles%20Watson-Wentworth%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Rockingham">Rockingham</a> government came to power (July 1765) and Parliament debated whether to repeal the stamp tax or to send an army to enforce it. Benjamin Franklin made the case for repeal, explaining that the colonies had spent heavily in manpower, money, and blood in defense of the empire in a series of wars against the French and Indians, and that further taxes to pay for those wars were unjust and might bring about a rebellion. Parliament agreed and repealed the tax (February 21, 1766), but insisted in the <a href="Declaratory%20Act">Declaratory Act</a> of March 1766 that they retained full power to make laws for the colonies "in all cases whatsoever". The repeal nonetheless caused widespread celebrations in the colonies.

In 1767, the Parliament passed the <a href="Townshend%20Acts">Townshend Acts</a> which placed duties on a number of essential goods, including paper, glass, and tea, and established a Board of Customs in Boston to more rigorously execute trade regulations. The new taxes were enacted on the belief that Americans only objected to internal taxes and not to external taxes such as custom duties. The Americans, however, argued against the constitutionality of the act because its purpose was to raise revenue and not regulate trade. Colonists responded by organizing new boycotts of British goods. These boycotts were less effective, however, as the Townshend goods were widely used.

In February 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts Bay <a href="Massachusetts%20Circular%20Letter">issued a circular letter</a> to the other colonies urging them to coordinate resistance. The governor dissolved the assembly when it refused to rescind the letter. Meanwhile, a riot broke out in Boston in June 1768 over the seizure of the sloop "Liberty", owned by <a href="John%20Hancock">John Hancock</a>, for alleged smuggling. Customs officials were forced to flee, prompting the British to deploy troops to Boston. A Boston town meeting declared that no obedience was due to parliamentary laws and called for the convening of a convention. A convention assembled but only issued a mild protest before dissolving itself. In January 1769, Parliament responded to the unrest by reactivating the <a href="Treason%20Act%201543">Treason Act 1543</a> which called for subjects outside the realm to face trials for treason in England. The governor of Massachusetts was instructed to collect evidence of said treason, and the threat caused widespread outrage, though it was not carried out.

On March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around a group of British soldiers. The crowd grew threatening, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris at them. One soldier was clubbed and fell. There was no order to fire, but the soldiers fired into the crowd anyway. They hit 11 people; three civilians died at the scene of the shooting, and two died after the incident. The event quickly came to be called the <a href="Boston%20Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>. The soldiers were tried and acquitted (defended by <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>), but the widespread descriptions soon began to turn colonial sentiment against the British. This, in turn, began a downward spiral in the relationship between Britain and the Province of Massachusetts.

A new ministry under <a href="Lord%20North">Lord North</a> came to power in 1770, and Parliament withdrew all taxes except the tax on tea, giving up its efforts to raise revenue while maintaining the right to tax. This temporarily resolved the crisis, and the boycott of British goods largely ceased, with only the more radical patriots such as <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a> continuing to agitate.

In June 1772, American <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">patriots</a>, including <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">John Brown</a>, burned a British warship that had been vigorously enforcing unpopular trade regulations in what became known as the <a href="Gaspee%20Affair">"Gaspee" Affair</a>. The affair was investigated for possible treason, but no action was taken.

In 1772, it became known that the Crown intended to pay fixed salaries to the governors and judges in Massachusetts. Samuel Adams in Boston set about creating new Committees of Correspondence, which linked Patriots in all 13 colonies and eventually provided the framework for a rebel government. Virginia, the largest colony, set up its Committee of Correspondence in early 1773, on which Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson served.

A total of about 7000 to 8000 Patriots served on "Committees of Correspondence" at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities. Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the <a href="leadership">leaders</a> of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When the First Continental Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local Committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods.

In 1773, <a href="Hutchinson%20Letters%20Affair">private letters were published</a> in which Massachusetts Governor Thomas Hutchinson claimed that the colonists could not enjoy all English liberties, and Lieutenant Governor <a href="Andrew%20Oliver">Andrew Oliver</a> called for the direct payment of colonial officials. The letters' contents were used as evidence of a systematic plot against American rights, and discredited Hutchinson in the eyes of the people; the Assembly petitioned for his recall. <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, postmaster general for the colonies, acknowledged that he leaked the letters, which led to him being berated by British officials and fired from his job.

Meanwhile, Parliament passed the <a href="Tea%20Act">Tea Act</a> to lower the price of taxed tea exported to the colonies in order to help the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> undersell smuggled Dutch tea. Special consignees were appointed to sell the tea in order to bypass colonial merchants. The act was opposed by those who resisted the taxes and also by smugglers who stood to lose business. In most instances, the consignees were forced to resign and the tea was turned back, but Massachusetts governor Hutchinson refused to allow Boston merchants to give in to pressure. A town meeting in Boston determined that the tea would not be landed, and ignored a demand from the governor to disperse. On December 16, 1773, a group of men, led by Samuel Adams and dressed to evoke the appearance of American Indians, boarded the ships of the <a href="East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> and dumped £10,000 worth of tea from their holds (approximately £636,000 in 2008) into Boston Harbor. Decades later, this event became known as the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a> and remains a significant part of American patriotic lore.

 
The British government responded by passing several Acts which came to be known as the <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">Intolerable Acts</a>, which further darkened colonial opinion towards the British. They consisted of four laws enacted by the British parliament. The first was the <a href="Massachusetts%20Government%20Act">Massachusetts Government Act</a> which altered the Massachusetts charter and restricted town meetings. The second act was the <a href="Administration%20of%20Justice%20Act%201774">Administration of Justice Act</a> which ordered that all British soldiers to be tried were to be arraigned in Britain, not in the colonies. The third Act was the <a href="Boston%20Port%20Act">Boston Port Act</a>, which closed the port of Boston until the British had been compensated for the tea lost in the Boston Tea Party. The fourth Act was the <a href="Quartering%20Acts">Quartering Act of 1774</a>, which allowed royal governors to house British troops in the homes of citizens without requiring permission of the owner.

In response, Massachusetts patriots issued the <a href="Suffolk%20Resolves">Suffolk Resolves</a> and formed an alternative shadow government known as the "Provincial Congress" which began training militia outside British-occupied Boston. In September 1774, the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First Continental Congress</a> convened, consisting of representatives from each of the colonies, to serve as a vehicle for deliberation and collective action. During secret debates, conservative <a href="Joseph%20Galloway">Joseph Galloway</a> proposed the creation of a colonial Parliament that would be able to approve or disapprove of acts of the British Parliament, but his idea was not accepted. The Congress instead endorsed the proposal of John Adams that Americans would obey Parliament voluntarily but would resist all taxes in disguise. Congress called for a boycott beginning on 1 December 1774 of all British goods; it was enforced by new committees authorized by the Congress.

Massachusetts was declared in a state of rebellion in February 1775 and the British garrison received orders to disarm the rebels and arrest their leaders, leading to the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> on 19 April 1775. The Patriots laid siege to Boston, expelled royal officials from all the colonies, and took control through the establishment of <a href="Provincial%20Congress">Provincial Congress</a>es. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> followed on June 17, 1775. It was a British victory—but at a great cost: about 1,000 British casualties from a garrison of about 6,000, as compared to 500 American casualties from a much larger force. The Second Continental Congress was divided on the best course of action, but eventually produced the <a href="Olive%20Branch%20Petition">Olive Branch Petition</a>, in which they attempted to come to an accord with <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George</a>. The king, however, issued a <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Rebellion">Proclamation of Rebellion</a> which stated that the states were "in rebellion" and the members of Congress were traitors.

In the winter of 1775, the Americans <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">invaded Canada</a> under generals Benedict Arnold and Richard Montgomery. The attack was a complete failure; many Americans who weren't killed were either captured or died of smallpox.

In March 1776, the Continental Army forced the British to <a href="Evacuation%20Day%20%28Massachusetts%29">evacuate Boston</a>, with George Washington as the commander of the new army. The revolutionaries were now in full control of all 13 colonies and were ready to declare independence. There still were many Loyalists, but they were no longer in control anywhere by July 1776, and all of the Royal officials had fled.

Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a> in June 1775, the Patriots had control of Massachusetts outside the Boston city limits, and the Loyalists suddenly found themselves on the defensive with no protection from the British army. In all 13 colonies, Patriots had overthrown their existing governments, closing courts and driving away British officials. They had elected conventions and "legislatures" that existed outside any legal framework; new constitutions were drawn up in each state to supersede royal charters. They declared that they were states now, not colonies.

On January 5, 1776, <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> ratified the first state constitution. In May 1776, Congress voted to suppress all forms of crown authority, to be replaced by locally created authority. Virginia, <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, and New Jersey created their constitutions before July 4. <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut</a> simply took their existing <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a>s and deleted all references to the crown. The new states were all committed to republicanism, with no inherited offices. They decided what form of government to create, and also how to select those who would craft the constitutions and how the resulting document would be ratified. On 26 May 1776, <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> wrote James Sullivan from Philadelphia:

"Depend upon it, sir, it is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation, as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters. There will be no end of it. New claims will arise. Women will demand a vote. Lads from twelve to twenty one will think their rights not enough attended to, and every man, who has not a farthing, will demand an equal voice with any other in all acts of state. It tends to confound and destroy all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks, to one common level".

The resulting constitutions in states such as <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">Maryland</a>, Virginia, <a href="Delaware%20Colony">Delaware</a>, New York, and <a href="Constitution%20of%20Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> featured:
In Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Hampshire, the resulting constitutions embodied:

The radical provisions of Pennsylvania's constitution lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.

In April 1776, the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> issued the <a href="Halifax%20Resolves">Halifax Resolves</a>, explicitly authorizing its delegates to vote for independence. In May, Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule.

By June, nine colonies were ready for independence; one by one, the last four fell into line—Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and New York. <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a> was instructed by the Virginia legislature to propose independence, and he did so on June 7, 1776. On the 11th, a committee was created to draft a document explaining the justifications for separation from Britain. After securing enough votes for passage, independence was voted for on July 2. The <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> was drafted largely by <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and presented by the committee; it was slightly revised and unanimously adopted by the entire Congress on July 4, marking the formation of a new sovereign nation which called itself the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>.

The Second Continental Congress approved a new constitution, the "Articles of Confederation," for ratification by the states on November 15, 1777, and immediately began operating under their terms. The Articles were formally ratified on March 1, 1781. At that point, the Continental Congress was dissolved and a new government of the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation">United States in Congress Assembled</a> took its place on the following day, with <a href="Samuel%20Huntington%20%28statesman%29">Samuel Huntington</a> as presiding officer.

According to British historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a>, the British had significant advantages, including a highly trained army, the world's largest navy, and a highly efficient system of public finance that could easily fund the war. However, the British were seriously handicapped by their misunderstanding of the depth of support for the Patriot position. Ignoring the advice of General Gage, they misinterpreted the situation as merely a large-scale riot. London decided that they could overawe the Americans by sending a large military and naval force, forcing them to be loyal again:

Washington forced the British out of Boston in the spring of 1776, and neither the British nor the Loyalists controlled any significant areas. The British, however, were massing forces at their naval base at <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. They returned in force in July 1776, landing in New York and defeating Washington's Continental Army in August at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Long%20Island">Battle of Brooklyn</a>. Following that victory, the British requested a meeting with representatives from Congress to negotiate an end to hostilities.

A delegation including John Adams and Benjamin Franklin met <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Howe</a> on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a> in New York Harbor on September 11, in what became known as the <a href="Staten%20Island%20Peace%20Conference">Staten Island Peace Conference</a>. Howe demanded a retraction of the Declaration of Independence, which was refused, and negotiations ended. The British then <a href="Battle%20of%20Kip%27s%20Bay">quickly seized New York City</a> and nearly captured Washington's army. They made New York their main political and military base of operations in North America, <a href="Evacuation%20Day%20%28New%20York%29">holding it until November 1783</a>. The city became the destination for Loyalist refugees and a focal point of Washington's <a href="Intelligence%20in%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">intelligence network</a>.

The British also took New Jersey, pushing the Continental Army into Pennsylvania. Washington <a href="Washington%27s%20crossing%20of%20the%20Delaware">crossed the Delaware River</a> back into New Jersey in a surprise attack in late December 1776 and defeated Hessian and British armies at <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Trenton</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Princeton">Princeton</a>, thereby regaining control of most of New Jersey. The victories gave an important boost to Patriots at a time when morale was flagging, and have become iconic events of the war.

In 1777, the British sent Burgoyne's invasion force from Canada south to New York to seal off New England. Their aim was to neutralize the Yankees, whom the British perceived as the primary source of agitators. The British army in New York City went to Philadelphia in a major case of mis-coordination, capturing it from Washington. The invasion army under <a href="John%20Burgoyne">Burgoyne</a> was much too slow and became trapped in northern New York state. It surrendered after the <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Battles of Saratoga</a> in October 1777. From early October 1777 until November 15, a siege distracted British troops at <a href="Fort%20Mifflin">Fort Mifflin</a>, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and allowed Washington time to preserve the Continental Army by safely leading his troops to harsh winter quarters at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>.

In August 1775, George III declared Americans in arms against royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Battles of Saratoga</a> in October 1777, there were thousands of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation would have been easy. The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists, and therefore, no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat operations. At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.

The capture of a British army at Saratoga encouraged the French to formally enter the war in support of Congress. Benjamin Franklin negotiated a permanent military alliance in early 1778, significantly becoming the first country to officially recognize the Declaration of Independence. On February 6, 1778, a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amity%20and%20Commerce%20%28USA%E2%80%93France%29">Treaty of Amity and Commerce</a> and a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">Treaty of Alliance</a> were signed between the United States and France. <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt</a> spoke out in parliament urging Britain to make peace in America and to unite with America against France, while other British politicians who had previously sympathized with colonial grievances now turned against the Americans for allying with Britain's international rival and enemy.

Later, Spain (in 1779) and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> (1780) became allies of the French, leaving the British Empire to fight a global war alone without major allies, and requiring it to slip through a combined blockade of the Atlantic. The American theater thus became only one front in Britain's war. The British were forced to withdraw troops from continental America to reinforce the valuable sugar-producing Caribbean colonies, which were more lucrative to British investors.

British commander <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Sir Henry Clinton</a> evacuated Philadelphia and returned to New York City. General Washington intercepted Clinton in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth Court House</a>, the last major battle fought in the north. After an inconclusive engagement, the British successfully retreated to New York City. The northern war subsequently became a stalemate, as the focus of attention shifted to the smaller southern theater.
The British strategy in America now concentrated on a campaign in the southern states. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders saw the "southern strategy" as a more viable plan, as the south was perceived as being more strongly Loyalist, with a large population of recent immigrants as well as large numbers of slaves who might be captured or run away to join the British.

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> and controlled the <a href="Province%20of%20Georgia">Georgia</a> coastline. In 1780, they launched a fresh invasion and <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">took Charleston</a>, as well. A significant victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camden">Battle of Camden</a> meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, hoping that the Loyalists would rally to the flag.

Not enough Loyalists turned out, however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia, with a severely weakened army. Behind them, much of the territory that they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic <a href="guerrilla%20war">guerrilla war</a>, fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and American militia, which negated many of the gains that the British had previously made.

The British army under Cornwallis marched to <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown, Virginia</a> where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet. The fleet showed up, but so did a larger French fleet, so the British fleet returned to New York for reinforcements after the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Chesapeake">Battle of the Chesapeake</a>, leaving Cornwallis trapped. In October 1781, the British surrendered their second invading army of the war, under a siege by the combined French and Continental armies commanded by Washington.

Historians continue to debate whether the odds for American victory were long or short. <a href="John%20E.%20Ferling">John E. Ferling</a> says that the odds were so long that the American victory was "almost a miracle". On the other hand, <a href="Joseph%20Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> says that the odds favored the Americans, and asks whether there ever was any realistic chance for the British to win. He argues that this opportunity came only once, in the summer of 1776, and the British failed that test. Admiral Howe and his brother General Howe "missed several opportunities to destroy the Continental Army... Chance, luck, and even the vagaries of the weather played crucial roles." Ellis's point is that the strategic and tactical decisions of the Howes were fatally flawed because they underestimated the challenges posed by the Patriots. Ellis concludes that, once the Howe brothers failed, the opportunity for a British victory "would never come again."

Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathized with the Americans, but now it reached a new low. King George III personally wanted to fight on, but his supporters lost control of Parliament and no further major land offensives were launched in the American Theater.

Washington could not know that the British would not reopen hostilities after Yorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, almost to the point of mutiny or possible "coup d'état". The unrest among officers of the <a href="Newburgh%20Conspiracy">Newburgh Conspiracy</a> was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.

During negotiations in Paris, the American delegation discovered that France would support independence, but no territorial gains. The new nation would be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. The American delegation opened direct secret negotiations with London, cutting the French out. British Prime Minister <a href="William%20Petty%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Shelburne">Lord Shelburne</a> was in full charge of the British negotiations. He now saw a chance make the United States a valuable economic partner. The U.S. obtained all the land east of the Mississippi River, south of Canada, and north of Florida. It gained fishing rights off Canadian coasts, and agreed to allow British merchants and Loyalists to try to recover their property. It was a highly favorable treaty for the United States, and deliberately so from the British point of view. Prime Minister Shelburne foresaw highly profitable two-way trade between Britain and the rapidly growing United States, as indeed came to pass. Since the blockade was lifted and the old imperial restrictions were gone, American merchants were free to trade with any nation anywhere in the world, and their businesses flourished.

The British largely abandoned the Indian allies living in the new nation. They were not a party to this treaty and did not recognize it until they were defeated militarily by the United States. However, the British did promise to support the Indians. They sold them munitions and maintained forts in American territory until the <a href="Jay%20Treaty">Jay Treaty</a> of 1795.

Losing the war and the 13 colonies was a shock to Britain. The war revealed the limitations of Britain's <a href="fiscal-military%20state">fiscal-military state</a> when they discovered that they suddenly faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.

The result was a powerful crisis from 1776 to 1783. The peace in 1783 left France financially prostrate, while the British economy boomed thanks to the return of American business. The crisis ended after 1784 thanks to the King's shrewdness in outwitting <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> (the leader of the <a href="Fox-North%20Coalition">Fox-North Coalition</a>), and renewed confidence in the system engendered by the leadership of the new Prime Minister <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a>. Historians conclude that loss of the American colonies enabled Britain to deal with the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> with more unity and better organization than would otherwise have been the case. Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the <a href="Second%20British%20Empire">Second British Empire</a>.

Britain's war against the Americans, French, and Spanish cost about £100 million. The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money that it needed. Heavy spending brought France to the <a href="Causes%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution%23Economics%20and%20finances">verge of bankruptcy and revolution</a>, while the British had relatively little difficulty financing their war, keeping their suppliers and soldiers paid, and hiring tens of thousands of German soldiers.

Britain had a sophisticated financial system based on the wealth of thousands of landowners, who supported the government, together with banks and financiers in London. The British tax system collected about 12 percent of the GDP in taxes during the 1770s.

In sharp contrast, Congress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war. In 1775, there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise that it would be made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when <a href="Robert%20Morris%20%28financier%29">Robert Morris</a> was named <a href="Superintendent%20of%20Finance%20of%20the%20United%20States">Superintendent of Finance of the United States</a>.

Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private <a href="Bank%20of%20North%20America">Bank of North America</a> to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the national government's full share of money and supplies from the confederated states.

Congress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver). Congress made two issues of paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue amounted to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was "not worth a Continental", as people said.

The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes—but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.

Beginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780, Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork, and other necessities—an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.

Starting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder, and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam, lent large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.

The war finally ended in 1783 and was followed by a period of prosperity. The national government was still operating under the Articles of Confederation and was able to settle the issue of the western territories, which were ceded by the states to Congress. American settlers moved rapidly into those areas, with Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee becoming states in the 1790s.

However, the national government had no money to pay either the war debts owed to European nations and the private banks, or to pay Americans who had been given millions of dollars of promissory notes for supplies during the war. Nationalists led by Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and other veterans feared that the new nation was too fragile to withstand an international war, or even internal revolts such as the <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a> of 1786 in Massachusetts.

Calling themselves "Federalists," the nationalists convinced Congress to call the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention">Philadelphia Convention</a> in 1787. It adopted a new <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution</a> that provided for a much stronger federal government, including an effective executive in a <a href="Separation%20of%20powers">check-and-balance</a> system with the judiciary and legislature. The Constitution was ratified in 1788, after a fierce debate in the states over the nature of the proposed new government. The new government under President George Washington took office in New York in March 1789. Amendments to the Constitution were spearheaded in Congress by <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> as assurances to those who were cautious about federal power, guaranteeing many of the <a href="inalienable%20rights">inalienable rights</a> that formed a foundation for the revolution. The amendments were ratified by the states in 1791.

The national debt fell into three categories after the American Revolution. The first was the $12 million owed to foreigners, mostly money borrowed from France. There was general agreement to pay the foreign debts at full value. The national government owed $40 million and state governments owed $25 million to Americans who had sold food, horses, and supplies to the revolutionary forces. There were also other debts that consisted of <a href="promissory%20note">promissory note</a>s issued during the Revolutionary War to soldiers, merchants, and farmers who accepted these payments on the premise that the new Constitution would create a government that would pay these debts eventually.

The war expenses of the individual states added up to $114 million compared to $37 million by the central government. In 1790, Congress combined the remaining state debts with the foreign and domestic debts into one national debt totaling $80 million at the recommendation of first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Everyone received face value for wartime certificates, so that the national honor would be sustained and the national credit established.

The population of the 13 Colonies was not homogeneous in their political views and attitudes. Loyalties and allegiances varied widely within regions and communities and even within families, and sometimes shifted during the course of the Revolution.

The American Enlightenment was a critical precursor of the American Revolution. Chief among the ideas of the American Enlightenment were the concepts of Natural Law, Natural Rights, Consent of the Governed, Individualism, Property Rights, Self-Ownership, Self-Determination, liberalism, republicanism and fear of corruption. Collectively, the acceptance of these concepts by a growing number of American colonists began to foster an intellectual environment which would lead to a new sense of political and social identity.

<a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>'s (1632–1704) ideas on liberty influenced the political thinking behind the revolution, especially through his indirect influence on English writers such as <a href="John%20Trenchard%20%28writer%29">John Trenchard</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Gordon%20%28writer%29">Thomas Gordon</a>, and <a href="Benjamin%20Hoadly">Benjamin Hoadly</a>, whose political ideas in turn had a strong influence on the American revolutionaries. Locke is often referred to as "the philosopher of the American Revolution", and is credited with leading Americans to the critical concepts of social contract, natural rights, and "born free and equal." Locke's <a href="Two%20Treatises%20of%20Government">Two Treatises of Government</a> published in 1689 were especially influential. He argued that all humans were created equally free, and governments therefore needed the "consent of the governed." In late eighteenth-century America, belief was still widespread in "equality by creation" and "rights by creation".

The theory of the "<a href="social%20contract">social contract</a>" influenced the belief among many of the Founders that among the "natural rights" of man was the <a href="Right%20of%20revolution">right of the people to overthrow their leaders</a>, should those leaders betray the historic <a href="rights%20of%20Englishmen">rights of Englishmen</a>. In terms of writing state and national constitutions, the Americans heavily used <a href="Charles%20de%20Secondat%2C%20baron%20de%20Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a>'s analysis of the wisdom of the "balanced" British Constitution (<a href="mixed%20government">mixed government</a>).

A central motivating force behind the overthrow of monarchy and aristocracy was the American embrace of a political ideology called "republicanism", which was dominant in the colonies by 1775 but of minor importance back in Great Britain. The republicanism was inspired by the "<a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">country party</a>" in Great Britain, whose critique of British government emphasized that <a href="political%20corruption">corruption</a> was a terrible reality in Great Britain. Americans feared that the corruption was crossing the Atlantic; the commitment of most Americans to republican values and to their rights energized the revolution, as Britain was increasingly seen as hopelessly corrupt and hostile to American interests. Britain seemed to threaten the established liberties that Americans enjoyed. The greatest threat to liberty was depicted as corruption—not just in <a href="London">London</a> but at home, as well. The colonists associated it with luxury, and especially with inherited aristocracy, which they condemned.

The Founding Fathers were strong advocates of republican values, particularly <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>, <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, which required men to put civic duty ahead of their personal desires. Men had a civic duty to be prepared and willing to fight for the rights and liberties of their countrymen. John Adams wrote to <a href="Mercy%20Otis%20Warren">Mercy Otis Warren</a> in 1776, agreeing with some <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical</a> Greek and Roman thinkers in that "Public Virtue cannot exist without private, and public Virtue is the only Foundation of Republics." He continued:

For women, "<a href="republican%20motherhood">republican motherhood</a>" became the ideal, exemplified by <a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail Adams</a> and <a href="Mercy%20Otis%20Warren">Mercy Otis Warren</a>; the first duty of the republican woman was to instill republican values in her children and to avoid luxury and ostentation.

Some republics had emerged throughout history, such as the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> of the ancient world, but none ever existed that was based on liberal principles. Thomas Paine's pamphlet "<a href="Common%20Sense%20%28pamphlet%29">Common Sense</a>" appeared in January 1776, after the Revolution had started. It was widely distributed and loaned, and often read aloud in <a href="Tavern%23North%20America">taverns</a>, contributing significantly to spreading the ideas of republicanism and liberalism together, bolstering enthusiasm for separation from Great Britain, and encouraging recruitment for the Continental Army.

Paine provided a new and widely accepted argument for independence by advocating a complete break with history. "Common Sense" is oriented to the future in a way that compels the reader to make an immediate choice. It offered a solution for Americans disgusted and alarmed at the threat of tyranny.

<a href="Dissenter">Dissenting</a> churches of the day (i.e., Protestant, non-<a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>) were, in the words of Patricia Bonomi, the "school of <a href="democracy">democracy</a>." President <a href="John%20Witherspoon">John Witherspoon</a> of the College of New Jersey (now <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>) wrote widely circulated sermons linking the American Revolution to the teachings of the Bible. Throughout the colonies, dissenting Protestant ministers (<a href="Congregationalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Congregationalist</a>, <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a>, and <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a>) preached Revolutionary themes in their sermons, while most Church of England clergymen preached loyalty to the king, the <a href="Supreme%20Governor%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">titular head</a> of the English state church. Religious motivation for fighting tyranny transcended socioeconomic lines to encompass rich and poor, men and women, frontiersmen and townsmen, farmers and merchants.

The Declaration also referred to the "Laws of Nature and of Nature's God" as justification for the Americans' separation from the British monarchy. Most eighteenth-century Americans believed that nature, the entire universe, was God's creation. Therefore, he was "Nature's God." Everything, including man, was part of the "universal order of things", which began with God and was pervaded and directed by his providence. Accordingly, the signers of the Declaration professed their "firm reliance on the Protection of divine Providence." And they appealed to "the Supreme Judge [God] for the rectitude of [their] intentions." Like most of his countrymen, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> was firmly convinced that he was an instrument of providence, to the benefit of the American people and of all humanity.

Historian <a href="Bernard%20Bailyn">Bernard Bailyn</a> argues that the evangelicalism of the era challenged traditional notions of natural hierarchy by preaching that the Bible teaches that all men are equal, so that the true value of a man lies in his moral behavior, not in his class. Kidd argues that religious <a href="The%20Establishment">disestablishment</a>, belief in a God as the source of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>, and shared convictions about sin, virtue, and <a href="divine%20providence">divine providence</a> worked together to unite rationalists and evangelicals and thus encouraged American defiance of the Empire. Bailyn, on the other hand, denies that religion played such a critical role. Alan Heimert argues that New Light antiauthoritarianism was essential to furthering democracy in colonial American society and set the stage for a confrontation with British monarchical and aristocratic rule.

Looking back, John Adams concluded in 1818:

In terms of class, Loyalists tended to have longstanding social and economic connections to British merchants and government; for instance, prominent merchants in major port cities such as New York, Boston and Charleston tended to be Loyalists, as did men involved with the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a> along the northern frontier. In addition, officials of colonial government and their staffs, those who had established positions and status to maintain, favored maintaining relations with Great Britain. They often were linked to British families in England by marriage as well.

By contrast, Patriots by number tended to be <a href="Yeoman%23United%20States">yeomen farmers</a>, especially in the frontier areas of New York and the backcountry of Pennsylvania, Virginia and down the Appalachian mountains. They were craftsmen and small merchants. Leaders of both the Patriots and the Loyalists were men of educated, propertied classes. The Patriots included many prominent men of the <a href="Planter%20%28American%20South%29">planter class</a> from Virginia and South Carolina, for instance, who became leaders during the Revolution, and formed the new government at the national and state levels.

To understand the opposing groups, historians have assessed evidence of their hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian <a href="Leonard%20Woods%20Labaree">Leonard Woods Labaree</a> identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots. Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality was on their side.

Loyalists were alienated when the Patriots resorted to violence, such as burning houses and <a href="tarring%20and%20feathering">tarring and feathering</a>. Loyalists wanted to take a centrist position and resisted the Patriots' demand to declare their opposition to the Crown. Many Loyalists, especially merchants in the port cities, had maintained strong and long-standing relations with Britain (often with business and family links to other parts of the British Empire).

Many Loyalists realized that independence was bound to come eventually, but they were fearful that revolution might lead to anarchy, tyranny or mob rule. In contrast, the prevailing attitude among Patriots, who made systematic efforts to use mob violence in a controlled manner, was a desire to seize the initiative. Labaree also wrote that Loyalists were pessimists who lacked the confidence in the future displayed by the Patriots.

Historians in the early 20th century, such as <a href="J.%20Franklin%20Jameson">J. Franklin Jameson</a>, examined the class composition of the Patriot cause, looking for evidence of a class war inside the revolution. In the last 50 years, historians have largely abandoned that interpretation, emphasizing instead the high level of ideological unity. Just as there were rich and poor Loyalists, the Patriots were a 'mixed lot', with the richer and better educated more likely to become officers in the Army.

Ideological demands always came first: the Patriots viewed independence as a means to gain freedom from British oppression and taxation and, above all, to reassert what they considered to be their rights as English subjects. Most yeomen farmers, craftsmen, and small merchants joined the Patriot cause to demand more political equality. They were especially successful in Pennsylvania but less so in New England, where John Adams attacked Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" for the "absurd democratical notions" it proposed.

The war became a personal issue for <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the king</a>, fueled by his growing belief that British leniency would be taken as weakness by the Americans. The king also sincerely believed he was defending Britain's constitution against usurpers, rather than opposing patriots fighting for their natural rights.

At the time, revolutionaries were called "Patriots", "Whigs", "Congress-men", or "Americans". They included a full range of social and economic classes, but were unanimous regarding the need to defend the rights of Americans and uphold the principles of <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republicanism</a> in terms of rejecting monarchy and aristocracy, while emphasizing civic virtue on the part of the citizens. Newspapers were strongholds of patriotism (although there were a few Loyalist papers), and printed many pamphlets, announcements, patriotic letters and pronouncements.

According to historian Robert Calhoon, the consensus of historians is that 40–45% of the white population in the Thirteen Colonies supported the Patriots' cause, 15–20% supported the Loyalists, and the remainder were neutral or kept a low profile. Mark Lender explores why ordinary folk became insurgents against the British even though they were unfamiliar with the ideological rationales being offered. They held very strongly a sense of "rights" that they felt the British were violating – rights that stressed local autonomy, fair dealing, and government by consent. They were highly sensitive to the issue of tyranny, which they saw manifested in the British response to the Boston Tea Party. The arrival in Boston of the British Army heightened their sense of violated rights, leading to rage and demands for revenge. They had faith that God was on their side.

The consensus of scholars is that about 15–20% of the white population remained loyal to the British Crown. Those who actively supported the king were known at the time as "Loyalists", "Tories", or "King's men". The Loyalists never controlled territory unless the British Army occupied it. Loyalists were typically older, less willing to break with old loyalties, often connected to the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, and included many established merchants with strong business connections across the Empire, as well as royal officials such as Thomas Hutchinson of Boston. There were 500 to 1000 <a href="Black%20Loyalist">black loyalists</a> who were held as slaves by patriots, escaped to British lines and joined the British army. Most died of disease but Britain took the survivors to Canada as free men.

The revolution could divide families. The most dramatic example was when <a href="William%20Franklin">William Franklin</a>, son of Benjamin Franklin and royal governor of the <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">Province of New Jersey</a>, remained loyal to the Crown throughout the war; they never spoke again. Recent immigrants who had not been fully Americanized were also inclined to support the King, such as recent Scottish settlers in the back country; among the more striking examples of this, see <a href="Flora%20MacDonald%20%28Scottish%20Jacobite%29">Flora MacDonald</a>.

After the war, the great majority of the 450,000–500,000 Loyalists remained in America and resumed normal lives. Some, such as <a href="Samuel%20Seabury%20%281729%E2%80%931796%29">Samuel Seabury</a>, became prominent American leaders. Estimates vary, but about 62,000 Loyalists relocated to Canada, and others to Britain (7,000) or to Florida or the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> (9,000). The exiles represented approximately 2% of the total population of the colonies. Nearly all <a href="Black%20Loyalist">black loyalists</a> left for Nova Scotia, Florida, or England, where they could remain free. When Loyalists left the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> in 1783, they took thousands of their slaves with them to be slaves in the British West Indies.

A minority of uncertain size tried to stay neutral in the war. Most kept a low profile, but the <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quakers</a>, especially in Pennsylvania, were the most important group to speak out for neutrality. As Patriots declared independence, the Quakers, who continued to do business with the British, were attacked as supporters of British rule, "contrivers and authors of seditious publications" critical of the revolutionary cause. Though the majority of Quakers attempted to remain neutral, a sizable number of <a href="Quakers%20in%20the%20American%20Revolution">Quakers in the American Revolution</a> nevertheless participated to some degree.

Women contributed to the American Revolution in many ways, and were involved on both sides. While formal Revolutionary politics did not include women, ordinary domestic behaviors became charged with political significance as Patriot women confronted a war that permeated all aspects of political, civil, and domestic life. They participated by boycotting British goods, spying on the British, following armies as they marched, washing, cooking, and tending for soldiers, delivering secret messages, and in a few cases like <a href="Deborah%20Samson">Deborah Samson</a>, fighting disguised as men. Also, <a href="Mercy%20Otis%20Warren">Mercy Otis Warren</a> held meetings in her house and cleverly attacked Loyalists with her creative plays and histories. Above all, they continued the agricultural work at home to feed their families and the armies. They maintained their families during their husbands' absences and sometimes after their deaths.

American women were integral to the success of the boycott of British goods, as the boycotted items were largely household items such as tea and cloth. Women had to return to knitting goods, and to spinning and weaving their own cloth — skills that had fallen into disuse. In 1769, the women of Boston produced 40,000 skeins of yarn, and 180 women in <a href="Middleton%2C%20Massachusetts">Middletown, Massachusetts</a> wove of cloth.

A crisis of political loyalties could disrupt the fabric of colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man did or did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.

In early 1776, France set up a major program of aid to the Americans, and the Spanish secretly added funds. Each country spent one million "livres tournaises" to buy munitions. A <a href="dummy%20corporation">dummy corporation</a> run by <a href="Pierre%20Beaumarchais">Pierre Beaumarchais</a> concealed their activities. American rebels obtained some munitions through the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> as well as French and Spanish ports in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>.

Spain did not officially recognize the U.S. but became an informal ally when it declared war on Britain on June 21, 1779. <a href="Bernardo%20de%20G%C3%A1lvez%20y%20Madrid">Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid</a>, general of the Spanish forces in <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>, also served as governor of Louisiana. He led an expedition of colonial troops to force the British out of Florida and keep open a vital conduit for supplies.

Most American Indians rejected pleas that they remain neutral and supported the British Crown, both because of trading relationships and Britain's effort to establish an Indian reserve and prohibit Colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The great majority of the 200,000 Indians east of the Mississippi distrusted the Colonists and supported the British cause, hoping to forestall continued colonial encroachment on their territories. Those tribes that were more closely involved in Colonial trade tended to side with the Colonists, although political factors were important, as well.

Most Indians did not participate directly in the war, except for warriors and bands associated with four of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> nations in New York and Pennsylvania which allied with the British. The British did have other allies, especially in the upper Midwest. They provided Indians with funding and weapons to attack American outposts. Some Indians tried to remain neutral, seeing little value in joining what they perceived to be a European conflict, and fearing reprisals from whichever side they opposed. The <a href="Oneida%20tribe">Oneida</a> and <a href="Tuscarora%20people">Tuscarora</a> among the Iroquois of central and western New York supported the American cause.

The British provided arms to Indians who were led by <a href="Loyalists">Loyalists</a> in war parties to raid frontier settlements from the <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Carolinas</a> to New York. They killed many settlers on the frontier, especially in Pennsylvania and New York's Mohawk Valley.

In 1776, <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> war parties attacked American Colonists all along the southern frontier of the uplands throughout the <a href="Washington%20District%2C%20North%20Carolina">Washington District, North Carolina</a> (now Tennessee) and the Kentucky wilderness area. They would launch raids with roughly 200 warriors, as seen in the <a href="Cherokee%E2%80%93American%20wars">Cherokee–American wars</a>; they could not mobilize enough forces to invade Colonial areas without the help of allies, most often the <a href="Muscogee%20%28Creek%29">Creek</a>. The <a href="Chickamauga%20Cherokee">Chickamauga Cherokee</a> under <a href="Dragging%20Canoe">Dragging Canoe</a> allied themselves closely with the British, and fought on for an additional decade after the signing of the Treaty of Paris.

<a href="Joseph%20Brant">Joseph Brant</a> of the powerful <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk nation</a>, part of the Iroquois Confederacy based in New York, was the most prominent Indian leader against the Colonial forces. In 1778 and 1780, he led 300 Iroquois warriors and 100 white Loyalists in multiple attacks on small frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania, killing many settlers and destroying villages, crops, and stores. The Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga of the Iroquois Confederacy also allied with the British against the Americans.

In 1779, the Colonists retaliated with an American army under <a href="John%20Sullivan%20%28general%29">John Sullivan</a> which raided and destroyed 40 empty Iroquois villages in central and western New York. Sullivan's forces systematically burned the villages and destroyed about 160,000 bushels of corn that composed the winter food supply. Facing starvation and homeless for the winter, the Iroquois fled to the Niagara Falls area and to Canada, mostly to what became Ontario. The British resettled them there after the war, providing land grants as compensation for some of their losses.

At the peace conference following the war, the British ceded lands which they did not really control, and did not consult their Indian allies. They transferred control to the United States of all the land east of the Mississippi and north of Florida. Calloway concludes:

The British did not give up their forts in the West until 1796 in what is now the eastern Midwest, stretching from Ohio to Wisconsin; they kept alive the dream of forming a satellite Indian nation there, which they called a Neutral Indian Zone. That goal was one of the causes of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Free blacks in the North and South fought on both sides of the Revolution, but <a href="Military%20history%20of%20African%20Americans%23Revolutionary%20War">most fought for the Patriots</a>. Gary Nash reports that there were about 9,000 black Patriots, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants to officers, and spies. Ray Raphael notes that thousands did join the Loyalist cause, but "a far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots." <a href="Crispus%20Attucks">Crispus Attucks</a> was shot dead by British soldiers in the <a href="Boston%20Massacre">Boston Massacre</a> in 1770 and is an iconic martyr to Patriots. Both sides offered freedom and re-settlement to slaves who were willing to fight for them, recruiting slaves whose owners supported the opposing cause.

Many black slaves sided with the Loyalists. Tens of thousands in the South used the turmoil of war to escape, and the southern plantation economies of South Carolina and Georgia especially were disrupted. During the Revolution, the British tried to turn slavery against the Americans. Historian <a href="David%20Brion%20Davis">David Brion Davis</a> explains the difficulties with a policy of wholesale arming of the slaves:

Davis underscored the British dilemma: "Britain, when confronted by the rebellious American colonists, hoped to exploit their fear of <a href="Slave%20rebellion">slave revolts</a> while also reassuring the large number of slave-holding Loyalists and wealthy Caribbean planters and merchants that their slave property would be secure". The Colonists, however, accused the British of encouraging slave revolts.

American advocates of independence were commonly lampooned in Britain for what was termed their hypocritical calls for freedom, at the same time that many of their leaders were planters who held hundreds of slaves. <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> snapped, "how is it we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the [slave] drivers of the Negroes?" Benjamin Franklin countered by criticizing the British self-congratulation about "the freeing of one Negro" (<a href="Somersett%27s%20Case">Somersett</a>) while they continued to permit the <a href="Slave%20Trade">Slave Trade</a>.

<a href="Phyllis%20Wheatley">Phyllis Wheatley</a> was a black poet who popularized the image of <a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a> to represent America. She came to public attention when her "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral" appeared in 1773.

During the war, slaves escaped from New England and the mid-Atlantic area to British-occupied cities such as New York. The effects of the war were more dramatic in the South. In Virginia, royal governor Lord <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">Dunmore</a> recruited black men into the British forces with the promise of freedom, protection for their families, and land grants. Tens of thousands of slaves escaped to British lines throughout the South, causing dramatic losses to slaveholders and disrupting cultivation and harvesting of crops. For instance, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> was estimated to have lost about 25,000 slaves to flight, migration, or death—amounting to one third of its slave population. From 1770 to 1790, the black proportion of the population (mostly slaves) in South Carolina dropped from 60.5 percent to 43.8 percent, and from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>.

British forces gave transportation to 10,000 slaves when they evacuated <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> and <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, carrying through on their promise. They evacuated and resettled more than 3,000 <a href="Black%20Loyalist">Black Loyalist</a>s from New York to <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>, and <a href="Lower%20Canada">Lower Canada</a>. Others sailed with the British to England or were resettled as freedmen in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> of the Caribbean. But slaves who were carried to the Caribbean under control of Loyalist masters generally remained slaves until British abolition in its colonies in 1834. More than 1,200 of the Black Loyalists of Nova Scotia later resettled in the British colony of <a href="History%20of%20Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, where they became leaders of the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Creole%20people">Krio</a> ethnic group of Freetown and the later national government. Many of their descendants still live in Sierra Leone, as well as other African countries.

About 60,000 to 70,000 Loyalists left the newly founded republic; some migrated to Britain. The remainder, known as <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalists">United Empire Loyalists</a>, received land and subsidies for resettlement in British colonies in North America, especially <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a> (concentrating in the <a href="Eastern%20Townships">Eastern Townships</a>), <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>, and <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. The new colonies of Upper Canada (now <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>) and <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> were expressly created by Britain for their benefit, where the Crown awarded land to Loyalists as compensation for losses in the United States. Britain wanted to develop the frontier of Upper Canada on a British colonial model. But about 80% of the Loyalists stayed in the United States and became full, loyal citizens; some of the exiles later returned to the U.S.

Interpretations about the effect of the Revolution vary. Contemporary participants referred to the events as "the revolution". Greene argues that the events were not "revolutionary", as the relationships and property rights of colonial society were not transformed: a distant government was simply replaced with a local one; the Revolution is still sometimes known outside the United States as the American War of Independence.

Historians such as <a href="Bernard%20Bailyn">Bernard Bailyn</a>, <a href="Gordon%20S.%20Wood">Gordon Wood</a>, and <a href="Edmund%20Morgan%20%28historian%29">Edmund Morgan</a> accept the contemporary view of the participants that the American Revolution was a unique and radical event that produced deep changes and had a profound effect on world affairs, based on an increasing belief in the principles of the Enlightenment, as reflected in how liberalism was understood during the period, and republicanism. These were demonstrated by a leadership and government that espoused protection of natural rights, and a system of laws chosen by the people. However, what was then considered "the people" was still mostly restricted to free white males who were able to pass a property-qualification. Such a restriction made a significant gain of the revolution in the short term irrelevant to women, African Americans and slaves, poor white men, youth, and Native Americans. Only with the development of the American system over the following centuries would "a government by the people", promised by the revolution, be won for a greater proportion of the population.

Morgan has argued that in terms of long-term impact on American society and values:

After the Revolution, genuinely democratic politics became possible in the former colonies. The rights of the people were incorporated into state constitutions. Concepts of liberty, individual rights, equality among men and hostility toward corruption became incorporated as core values of liberal republicanism. The greatest challenge to the old order in Europe was the challenge to inherited political power and the democratic idea that government rests on the <a href="consent%20of%20the%20governed">consent of the governed</a>. The example of the first successful revolution against a European empire, and the first successful establishment of a republican form of democratically elected government, provided a model for many other colonial peoples who realized that they too could break away and become self-governing nations with directly elected representative government.

The Dutch Republic, also at war with Britain, was the next country to sign a treaty with the United States, on October 8, 1782. On April 3, 1783, Ambassador Extraordinary <a href="Gustaf%20Philip%20Creutz">Gustaf Philip Creutz</a>, representing King <a href="Gustav%20III%20of%20Sweden">Gustav III of Sweden</a>, and Benjamin Franklin, signed a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amity%20and%20Commerce%20%28USA%E2%80%93Sweden%29">Treaty of Amity and Commerce</a> with the U.S.

The American Revolution was the first wave of the <a href="Atlantic%20Revolutions">Atlantic Revolutions</a>: the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, the <a href="Haitian%20Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>, and the <a href="Latin%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">Latin American wars of independence</a>. Aftershocks reached Ireland in the <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>, in the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, and in the Netherlands.

The Revolution had a strong, immediate influence in Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and France. Many British and Irish <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a> spoke in favor of the American cause. In Ireland, there was a profound impact; the Protestants who controlled Ireland were demanding more and more self-rule. Under the leadership of <a href="Henry%20Grattan">Henry Grattan</a>, the so-called "<a href="Irish%20Patriot%20Party%23Grattan%27s%20Patriots">Patriots</a>" forced the reversal of mercantilist prohibitions against trade with other British colonies. The King and his cabinet in London could not risk another rebellion on the American model, and made a series of concessions to the Patriot faction in Dublin. Armed Protestant volunteer units were set up to protect against an invasion from France. As in America, so too in Ireland the King no longer had a monopoly of lethal force.

The Revolution, along with the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a> (end of the 16th century) and the 17th century <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, was among the examples of overthrowing an old regime for many Europeans who later were active during the era of the French Revolution, such as <a href="Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a>. The American Declaration of Independence influenced the French <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen</a> of 1789. The spirit of the Declaration of Independence led to laws ending slavery in all the Northern states and the Northwest Territory, with New Jersey the last in 1804. States such as New Jersey and New York adopted gradual emancipation, which kept some people as slaves for more than two decades longer.

The democratic ideals of the Revolution inspired changes in the roles of women.

The concept of <a href="republican%20motherhood">republican motherhood</a> was inspired by this period and reflects the importance of <a href="revolutionary%20republicanism">Republicanism as the dominant American ideology</a>. It assumed that a successful republic rested upon the virtue of its citizens. Women were considered to have the essential role of instilling their children with values conducive to a healthy republic. During this period, the wife's relationship with her husband also became more liberal, as love and affection instead of obedience and subservience began to characterize the ideal marital relationship. In addition, many women contributed to the war effort through fundraising and running family businesses in the absence of husbands.

The traditional constraints gave way to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate the size of their families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.
Whatever gains they had made, however, women still found themselves subordinated, legally and socially, to their husbands, disfranchised and usually with only the role of mother open to them. But, some women earned livelihoods as midwives and in other roles in the community, which were not originally recognized as significant by men.

<a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail Adams</a> expressed to her husband, the president, the desire of women to have a place in the new republic:

Zagarri in 2007 argued that the American Revolution created a continuing debate on the rights of woman and an environment favorable to women's participation in U.S. politics. She asserts that for a brief decade, a "comprehensive transformation in women's rights, roles, and responsibilities seemed not only possible but perhaps inevitable." But, the changes also engendered a backlash that set back the cause of women's rights and led to a greater rigidity that marginalized women from political life.

For more than thirty years, however, the 1776 <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20Constitution">New Jersey State Constitution</a> gave the vote to "all inhabitants" who had a certain level of wealth, including unmarried women and blacks (not married women because they could not own property separately from their husbands), until in 1807, when that state legislature passed a bill interpreting the constitution to mean universal "white male" <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a>, excluding paupers.

In the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and individuals took actions to free numerous slaves, in part based on revolutionary ideals. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states, such as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed laws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery by a gradual method; in New York, the last slaves were freed in 1827.

While no southern state abolished slavery, for a period individual owners could free their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves as a reward for service. Records also suggest that some slaveholders were freeing their own <a href="mixed-race">mixed-race</a> children, born into slavery to slave mothers.

The American Revolution has a central place in the American memory. As the founding story, it is covered in the schools, memorialized by a national holiday, and commemorated in innumerable monuments. Thus <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> (the "Fourth of July") is a major national holiday celebrated annually. Besides local sites such as Bunker Hill, one of the first national pilgrimages for memorial tourists was <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, George Washington's estate (near <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington City</a>), which attracted ten thousand visitors a year by the 1850s.

Crider points out that in the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric. Ryan, noting that the Bicentennial was celebrated a year after the United States' humiliating 1975 withdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and presented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and fresh.

Albanese argues that the Revolution became the main source of the non-denominational "<a href="American%20civil%20religion">American civil religion</a>" that has shaped patriotism, and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. She says that specific battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). Thus she points out the Revolution produced a <a href="Moses">Moses</a>-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Tom Paine), disciples (Alexander Hamilton, James Madison) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge, Bunker Hill), rituals (Boston Tea Party), emblems (the new flag), sacred holidays (Independence Day), and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights).

Sir Alan Ayckbourn, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (born 12 April 1939) is a prolific English playwright and director. He has written and produced more than seventy full-length plays in <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> and <a href="London">London</a> and was, between 1972 and 2009, the artistic director of the <a href="Stephen%20Joseph%20Theatre">Stephen Joseph Theatre</a> in Scarborough, where all but four of his plays have received their first performance. More than 40 have subsequently been produced in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>, at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> or by the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> since his first hit "<a href="Relatively%20Speaking%20%28play%29">Relatively Speaking</a>" opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1969.

Major successes include "<a href="Absurd%20Person%20Singular">Absurd Person Singular</a>" (1975), "<a href="The%20Norman%20Conquests">The Norman Conquests</a>" trilogy (1973), "<a href="Bedroom%20Farce%20%28play%29">Bedroom Farce</a>" (1975), "Just Between Ourselves" (1976), "<a href="A%20Chorus%20of%20Disapproval%20%28play%29">A Chorus of Disapproval</a>" (1984), "<a href="Woman%20in%20Mind">Woman in Mind</a>" (1985), "<a href="A%20Small%20Family%20Business">A Small Family Business</a>" (1987), "<a href="Man%20Of%20The%20Moment%20%28play%29">Man Of The Moment</a>" (1988), <a href="House%20%26amp%3B%20Garden%20%28plays%29">"House" & "Garden"</a> (1999) and "<a href="Private%20Fears%20in%20Public%20Places">Private Fears in Public Places</a>" (2004). His plays have won numerous awards, including seven London "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" Awards. They have been translated into over 35 languages and are performed on stage and television throughout the world. Ten of his plays have been staged on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>, attracting two <a href="Tony%20Awards">Tony</a> nominations, and one <a href="Tony%20Awards">Tony</a> award.

Ayckbourn was born in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, London. His mother Irene Worley ("Lolly") (1906-1998) was a writer of short stories who published under the name "Mary James". His father, Horace Ayckbourn (1904-1965), was an orchestral violinist, at one time deputy leader of the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>. His parents, who separated shortly after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, never married, and Ayckbourn's mother divorced her first husband to marry again in 1948.

Ayckbourn wrote his first play at Wisborough Lodge (a preparatory school in the village of <a href="Wisborough%20Green">Wisborough Green</a>) when he was about 10. Whilst at prep school as a boarder, his mother wrote to tell him she was marrying Cecil Pye, a bank manager. When he went home for the holidays his new family consisted of his mother, his stepfather and Christopher, his stepfather's son by an earlier marriage. This relationship too, reportedly ran into difficulties early on.

Ayckbourn attended <a href="Haileybury%20and%20Imperial%20Service%20College">Haileybury and Imperial Service College</a>, in the village of <a href="Hertford%20Heath">Hertford Heath</a>, and whilst there toured Europe and America with the school's Shakespeare company.

After leaving school at 17, Ayckbourn's career took several temporary jobs in various places before starting a temporary job at the <a href="Stephen%20Joseph%20Theatre">Scarborough Library Theatre</a>, where he was introduced to the artistic director, <a href="Stephen%20Joseph">Stephen Joseph</a>. It is said that Joseph became both a mentor and father figure for Ayckbourn until his untimely death in 1967, and he has consistently spoken highly of him.

Ayckbourn's career was briefly interrupted when he was called for <a href="National%20Service">National Service</a>. He was swiftly discharged, officially on medical grounds, but it is suggested that a doctor who noticed his reluctance to join the Armed Forces deliberately failed the medical as a favour. Although Ayckbourn continued to move where his career took him, he settled in Scarborough, eventually buying Longwestgate House, the house formerly owned by <a href="Stephen%20Joseph">Stephen Joseph</a>.

In 1957, Ayckbourn married Christine Roland, another member of the Library Theatre company, and indeed Ayckbourn's first two plays were written jointly with her under the pseudonym of "Roland Allen". They had two sons, Steven and Philip. However, the marriage had difficulties which eventually led to their separation in 1971. Alan Ayckbourn said that his relationship with Christine became easy once they agreed their marriage was over. Around this time, he started to share a home with Heather Stoney, an actress he had first met ten years earlier. Like his mother, neither he nor Christine sought a divorce for the next thirty years and it was only in 1997 that they formally divorced; Ayckbourn married Heather Stoney. One side-effect of the timing is that, as Alan was awarded a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> a few months before the divorce, both his first and second wife are entitled to take the title of Lady Ayckbourn.

In February 2006, he suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> in Scarborough, and stated: "I hope to be back on my feet, or should I say my left leg, as soon as possible, but I know it is going to take some time. In the meantime I am in excellent hands and so is the Stephen Joseph Theatre." He left hospital after eight weeks and returned to directing after six months, but the following year he announced he would step down as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre. Ayckbourn, however, continues to write and direct his own work at the theatre.

Since Alan Ayckbourn's plays started becoming established in the West End, interviewers have raised the question of whether his work is autobiographical. There is no clear answer to this question. There has only been one biography, written by Paul Allen, and this primarily covers his career in the theatre. Ayckbourn has frequently said he sees aspects of himself in all his characters. For example, in "<a href="Bedroom%20Farce%20%28play%29">Bedroom Farce</a>" (1975), he admitted to being, in some respects, all four of the men in the play. It has been suggested that, after Ayckbourn himself, the person who is used the most in his plays is his mother, particularly as Susan in "<a href="Woman%20in%20Mind">Woman in Mind</a>" (1985).

What is less clear is how much influence events in Ayckbourn's life have had on his writing. It is true that the theme of marriages in various difficulties was heavily present throughout his plays in the early seventies, around the time his own marriage was coming to an end. However, by this time, he had also witnessed the failures of his parents' relationships as well as those of some of his friends. Which relationships, if any, he drew on for his plays, is unclear. In Paul Allen’s biography, Ayckbourn is briefly compared to Dafydd and Guy in "<a href="A%20Chorus%20of%20Disapproval%20%28play%29">A Chorus of Disapproval</a>" (1984). Both characters feel themselves in trouble, and there was speculation that Alan Ayckbourn himself may have felt himself to be in trouble. At the time, he had reportedly become seriously involved with another actress, which threatened his relationship with Heather Stoney. But again, it is unclear whether this had any effect on the writing, and Paul Allen's view is that it is not current experience that Ayckbourn uses for his plays.

It could be that Ayckbourn had written plays with himself and his own issues in mind, but as Ayckbourn is portrayed as a guarded and private man, it is hard to imagine him exposing his own life in his plays to any great degree. In the biography, Paul Allen wrote, regarding a suggestion in "Cosmopolitan" that his plays were becoming autobiographical: "If we take that to mean that his plays tell his own life story, he still hasn't started."

On leaving school his theatrical career started immediately, with an introduction to Sir <a href="Donald%20Wolfit">Donald Wolfit</a> by his French master. Ayckbourn joined Wolfit on tour to the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival%20Fringe">Edinburgh Festival Fringe</a> as an acting assistant stage manager (meaning a role that involved both acting and stage management) for three weeks, with his first role on the professional stage being various parts in "The Strong are Lonely" by <a href="Fritz%20Hochw%C3%A4lder">Fritz Hochwälder</a>. In the following year, Ayckbourn appeared in six other plays at the Connaught Theatre, <a href="Worthing">Worthing</a>, and the Thorndyke theatre, <a href="Leatherhead">Leatherhead</a>.

In 1957, Ayckbourn was employed by the director <a href="Stephen%20Joseph">Stephen Joseph</a> at the Library Theatre, <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>, the predecessor to the modern <a href="Stephen%20Joseph%20Theatre">Stephen Joseph Theatre</a>. His role, again, was initially an acting stage manager. This employment led to Ayckbourn's first professional script commission, in 1958. When he complained about the quality of a script he was performing, Joseph challenged him to write a better one. The result was "The Square Cat", written under the pseudonym Roland Allen and first performed in 1959. In this play, Ayckbourn himself played the character Jerry Watiss.

After thirty-four appearances in plays at the Library Theatre, including four of his own, in 1962 Ayckbourn moved to <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> to help set up the Victoria Theatre, (now the <a href="New%20Vic%20Theatre">New Vic</a>), where he appeared in a further eighteen plays. His final appearance in one of his own plays was as the Crimson Gollywog in the disastrous children's play "Christmas v Mastermind". He left the Stoke company in 1964, officially to commit his time to the London production of "Mr. Whatnot", but reportedly because was having trouble working with the artistic director, <a href="Peter%20Cheeseman">Peter Cheeseman</a>. By now, his career as a writer was coming to fruition, and his acting career was sidelined.

His final role on stage was as Jerry in "<a href="Two%20for%20the%20Seesaw">Two for the Seesaw</a>" by <a href="William%20Gibson%20%28playwright%29">William Gibson</a>, at the <a href="Rotherham%20Civic%20Theatre%20and%20Arts%20Centre">Civic Theatre</a> in <a href="Rotherham">Rotherham</a>. He was left stranded on stage because Heather Stoney was unable to re-appear because the props had been left unpacked, and this led him to decide acting was more trouble than it was worth. The assistant stage manager on the production, <a href="Bill%20Kenwright">Bill Kenwright</a>, would become one of the UK's most successful producers.

Alan Ayckbourn's earliest plays were written and produced at a time when the Scarborough Library theatre, like most regional theatres, regularly commissioned work from their own actors to keep costs down (the other notable actor whose work was being commissioned being <a href="David%20Campton">David Campton</a>). His first play, "The Square Cat", was sufficiently popular locally to secure further commissions, but neither this nor the following three plays had any major impact outside of Scarborough. But, after his transfer to <a href="New%20Vic%20Theatre">Victoria Theatre</a> in <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, there came "Christmas v Mastermind", which flopped and is now universally regarded as Ayckbourn's greatest disaster.

His fortunes began to revive in 1963 with "Mr. Whatnot", again premiering at the Victoria Theatre. This was the first play that Ayckbourn was sufficiently happy with to allow performances today, and the first play to receive a <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> performance. However, the West End production flopped, in part down to misguided casting. After this, Ayckbourn experimented by collaborating with comedians, first writing a monologue for <a href="Tommy%20Cooper">Tommy Cooper</a>, and later with <a href="Ronnie%20Barker">Ronnie Barker</a>, who played Lord Slingsby-Craddock in the London production of "Mr Whatnot" in 1964, for the scripts of for <a href="London%20Weekend%20Television">LWT</a>'s "<a href="Hark%20at%20Barker">Hark at Barker</a>". Ayckbourn used the pseudonym 'Peter Caulfield' because he was under exclusive contract to the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> at the time.

Then, in 1965, back at the Scarborough Library Theatre, "Meet my Father" was produced, later retitled "<a href="Relatively%20Speaking%20%28play%29">Relatively Speaking</a>". This time, the play was a massive success, both in Scarborough and the West End, making Alan Ayckbourn rich and earning him a congratulatory telegram from <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>. This was not quite the end of Ayckbourn's hit-and-miss record, because his following play, "<a href="The%20Sparrow%20%281967%20play%29">The Sparrow</a>" only ran for three weeks at Scarborough. However, the following play, "<a href="How%20the%20Other%20Half%20Loves">How the Other Half Loves</a>", secured his runaway success as a playwright.

The height of Ayckbourn's commercial success included "<a href="Absurd%20Person%20Singular">Absurd Person Singular</a>" (1975), "<a href="The%20Norman%20Conquests">The Norman Conquests</a>" trilogy (1973), "<a href="Bedroom%20Farce%20%28play%29">Bedroom Farce</a>" (1975) and "Just Between Ourselves" (1976), all plays that focused heavily on marriage in the British middle classes. The only failure during this period was a 1975 musical with <a href="Andrew%20Lloyd%20Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a>, "<a href="Jeeves%20%28musical%29">Jeeves</a>", and even this did little to dent Ayckbourn's popularity. Although his plays have received major West End productions almost from the beginning of his writing career, and hence have been reviewed in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20newspapers">British newspapers</a>, Ayckbourn's work was for years routinely dismissed as being too slight for serious study. Recently, scholars have begun to view Ayckbourn as an important commentator on the lifestyles of the British <a href="suburb">suburb</a>an <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>, and as a stylistic innovator who experiments with theatrical styles within the boundaries set by popular tastes.

From the 1980s, Ayckbourn began to move away from the recurring themes of marriage and explore other contemporary themes, one example being "<a href="Woman%20in%20Mind">Woman in Mind</a>", a play performed entirely from the perspective of a Woman going through a nervous breakdown. He also experimented with several more unconventional ways of writing plays, such as "Intimate Exchanges", which has one beginning and sixteen possible endings, and "<a href="House%20%26amp%3B%20Garden%20%28plays%29">House & Garden</a>", where two plays take place simultaneously of two different stages, as well as diversifying into children's theatre (such as "<a href="Mr%20A%27s%20Amazing%20Maze%20Plays">Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays</a>" and musical plays, such as "<a href="By%20Jeeves">By Jeeves</a>" (a more successful rewrite of the original "Jeeves").

With a résumé of over seventy plays, of which more than forty have played at the National Theatre or in the West End, Alan Ayckbourn is one of England’s most successful living playwrights. Despite his success, honours and awards (which include a prestigious <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Award">Laurence Olivier Award</a>), Alan Ayckbourn remains a relatively anonymous figure dedicated to regional theatre. Throughout his writing career, all but four of his plays were premiered at the <a href="Stephen%20Joseph%20Theatre">Stephen Joseph Theatre</a> in Scarborough in its three different locations.

Alan Ayckbourn received the CBE in 1987 and was knighted in the <a href="1997%20New%20Year%20Honours">1997 New Year Honours</a>. It is frequently claimed (but not proven) that Alan Ayckbourn is the most performed living English playwright, and the second most performed of all time after <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>.

Although Alan Ayckbourn's plays no longer dominate the theatrical scene on the scale of his earlier works, he continues to write, his most recent major success being "<a href="Private%20Fears%20in%20Public%20Places">Private Fears in Public Places</a>" that had a hugely successful <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> run at <a href="59E59%20Theaters">59E59 Theaters</a>, and in 2006 was made into a film "<a href="C%C5%93urs">Cœurs</a>", directed by <a href="Alain%20Resnais">Alain Resnais</a>. After suffering a stroke, there was uncertainly as to whether he could continue to write (the Ayckbourn play premiered immediately after the stroke, "<a href="If%20I%20Were%20You%20%28play%29">If I Were You</a>", was written before his illness), but his first play written afterwards, "<a href="Life%20and%20Beth">Life and Beth</a>", was premiered in the summer of 2008. Ayckbourn continues to write for the Stephen Joseph Theatre on invitation of his successor as artistic director, Chris Monks, with the first new play under this arrangement, "<a href="My%20Wonderful%20Day">My Wonderful Day</a>", performed in October 2009. His latest play, "Roundelay" is scheduled to open in September 2014; the order in which each of the five acts is played in each performance is to be left to chance (allowing 120 possible permutations), with members of the audience being invited to extract five coloured ping pong balls from a bag beforehand.

Many of Ayckbourn's plays have had their New York premiere at <a href="59E59%20Theaters">59E59 Theaters</a> as part of their annual Brits Off Broadway Festitval including "<a href="Private%20Fears%20in%20Public%20Places">Private Fears in Public Places</a>", "<a href="Intimate%20Exchanges">Intimate Exchanges</a>", "<a href="My%20Wonderful%20Day">My Wonderful Day</a>" and "<a href="Neighbourhood%20Watch%20%28Ayckbourn%20play%29">Neighbourhood Watch</a>" among others.

Although Alan Ayckbourn is best known as a writer, it is said that he only spends 10% of his time writing plays. Most of the rest of his time is spent directing.

Alan Ayckbourn began directing at the <a href="Stephen%20Joseph%20Theatre">Scarborough Library Theatre</a> in 1961, with a production of "<a href="Gas%20Light">Gas Light</a>" by <a href="Patrick%20Hamilton%20%28dramatist%29">Patrick Hamilton</a>. He directed five other plays that year and the following year in Scarborough, and after transferring to the <a href="New%20Vic%20Theatre">Victoria Theatre</a>, directed a further six plays in 1963. Between 1964 and 1967 (when much of his time was taken up by various productions of his early successes "Mr. Whatnot" and "<a href="Relatively%20Speaking%20%28play%29">Relatively Speaking</a>") he only directed one play ("<a href="The%20Sparrow%20%281967%20play%29">The Sparrow</a>", written by himself, later withdrawn), but in 1968 he resumed regularly directing plays, mostly at Scarborough. At this time he also worked as a radio drama producer for the BBC, based in Leeds.

At first, his directing career was separate from his writing career. It was not until 1963 that Ayckbourn directed a play of his own (a revival of "Standing Room Only"), 1967 that Ayckbourn directed a premiere of his own ("The Sparrow"). The London premieres remained in the hands of other directors for longer, with the first play of his both written and directed by him in London ("<a href="Bedroom%20Farce%20%28play%29">Bedroom Farce</a>") waiting until 1977.

After the death of <a href="Stephen%20Joseph">Stephen Joseph</a> in 1967, the position of Director of Productions was appointed on an annual basis. Alan Ayckbourn was offered this position in 1969 and 1970, succeeding Rodney Wood, but he handed the position over to Caroline Smith in 1971 (having spent most of his time that year in the USA with "<a href="How%20the%20Other%20Half%20Loves">How the Other Half Loves</a>"). He became Director of Productions again in 1972, and this time, on 12 November that same year, he was made the permanent artistic director of the theatre.

In mid-1986, Ayckbourn accepted an invitation to work as a visiting director for two years at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a> in London, form his own company, and perform a play in each of the three auditoria provided at least one was a new play of his own. Using a stock company that included established performers like <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>, <a href="Polly%20Adams">Polly Adams</a> and <a href="Simon%20Cadell">Simon Cadell</a>. The three plays became four, and were: "Tons of Money" by Will Evans and Valentine, with adaptations by Ayckbourn (Lyttelton), <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s "A View From the Bridge" (Cottesloe), his own "<a href="A%20Small%20Family%20Business">A Small Family Business</a>" (Olivier) and <a href="John%20Ford%20%28dramatist%29">John Ford</a>'s "<a href="%27Tis%20Pity%20She%27s%20a%20Whore">'Tis Pity She's a Whore</a>" (Olivier again). During this time, Alan Ayckbourn shared his role of artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre with Robin Herford and returned in 1987 to direct the premiere of "<a href="Henceforward...">Henceforward...</a>".

He announced in 1999 that he would step back from directing the work of other playwrights, in order to concentrate on his own plays, the last one being <a href="Rob%20Shearman">Rob Shearman</a>'s "Knights in Plastic Armour" in 1999; the exception being in 2002 when he directed the world premiere of <a href="Tim%20Firth">Tim Firth</a>'s "The Safari Party".

In 2002, following a dispute over the <a href="Duchess%20Theatre">Duchess Theatre</a>'s handling of "<a href="Damsels%20in%20Distress%20%28plays%29">Damsels in Distress</a>", Ayckbourn sharply criticised both this and the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>'s treatment of theatre in general, in particular their casting of celebrities. Although he did not explicitly say he would boycott the West End, he did not return to direct in the West End again until 2009 with a revival of "<a href="Woman%20in%20Mind">Woman in Mind</a>" (although he did allow other West End producers to revive "<a href="Absurd%20Person%20Singular">Absurd Person Singular</a>" in 2007 and "<a href="The%20Norman%20Conquests">The Norman Conquests</a>" in 2008).

After Ayckbourn suffered a stroke in February 2006, he returned to work in September and premiered his 70th play "<a href="If%20I%20Were%20You%20%28play%29">If I Were You</a>" at the Stephen Joseph Theatre the following month.

He announced in June 2007 that he would retire as artistic director of the Stephen Joseph Theatre after the 2008 season. His successor, Chris Monks, took over at the start of the 2009–2010 season, but Ayckbourn remained to direct premieres and revivals of his work at the theatre, beginning with "How the Other Half Loves" in June 2009.

In March 2010 he directed an in-the-round revival of his play "Taking Steps" at the <a href="Orange%20Tree%20Theatre">Orange Tree Theatre</a>, winning universal press acclaim.

In July 2014, Ayckbourn directed a <a href="https%3A//www.sjt.uk.com/content/boy-who-fell-book">musical adaptation</a> of "The Boy Who Fell Into A pageRank.Book", with musical adaptation and lyrics by Paul James and music by Eric Angus and Cathy Shostak. The show ran in The Stephen Joseph Theatre and received critical acclaim.


Ayckbourn also sits on the Council of <a href="the%20Society%20of%20Authors">the Society of Authors</a>.

There are eight one-act plays written by Alan Ayckbourn. Five of them ("Mother Figure", "Drinking Companion", "Between Mouthfuls", "Gosforth’s Fete" and "Widows Might") were written for "<a href="Confusions">Confusions</a>", first performed in 1974.

The other three one-act plays were:

Alpha Centauri

Alpha Centauri (α Centauri, abbreviated Alpha Cen, α Cen) is the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars%20and%20brown%20dwarfs">closest</a> <a href="star%20system">star system</a> to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, being from the Sun. It consists of three stars: Alpha Centauri A (also named Rigil Kentaurus) and Alpha Centauri B, which form the <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> Alpha Centauri AB, and a small and faint <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>, Alpha Centauri C (also named <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>), which is loosely gravitationally bound and orbiting the other two at a current distance of about . To the unaided eye, the two main components appear as a single point of light with an apparent <a href="visual%20magnitude">visual magnitude</a> of −0.27, forming the brightest <a href="star">star</a> in the southern <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Centaurus">Centaurus</a> and is the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">third-brightest</a> star in the night sky, outshone only by <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> and <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>.

Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A) has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the luminosity of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, while Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B) is smaller and cooler, at 0.907 times the Sun's mass and 0.445 times its visual luminosity. During the pair's 79.91-year orbit about a <a href="barycenter">common centre</a>, the distance between them varies from nearly that between <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> and the Sun (35.6 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a>) to that between <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> and the Sun (11.2 AU).

Proxima Centauri (α Cen C) is at the slightly smaller distance of from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun, even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about , equivalent to about 430 times the size of <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>'s orbit. <a href="Proxima%20Centauri%20b">Proxima Centauri b</a>, an <a href="Terrestrial%20planet">Earth-sized</a> <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a> in the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> of Proxima Centauri, was discovered in 2016.

"α Centauri" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Alpha Centauri") is the system's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. It bore the traditional name "Rigil Kentaurus", which is a latinisation of the Arabic name "Rijl al-Qanṭūris," meaning "Foot of the <a href="Centaurus">Centaur</a>".

"Alpha Centauri C" was discovered in 1915 by the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> astronomer <a href="Robert%20T.%20A.%20Innes">Robert Innes</a>, Director of the <a href="Union%20Observatory">Union Observatory</a> in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, who suggested that it be named "Proxima Centauri" (actually "Proxima Centaurus"). The name is .

In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN states that in the case of <a href="Star%20system">multiple stars</a> the name should be understood to be attributed to the brightest component by visual brightness. The WGSN approved the name "Proxima Centauri" for "Alpha Centauri C" on 21 August 2016 and the name "Rigil Kentaurus" for "Alpha Centauri A" on 6 November 2016. They are now both so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Alpha Centauri is the name given to what appears as a single star to the naked eye and the <a href="first%20magnitude%20star">brightest</a> star in the southern constellation of <a href="Centaurus">Centaurus</a>. At −0.27 <a href="Apparent%20magnitude">apparent visual magnitude</a> (<a href="Apparent%20magnitude%23Magnitude%20addition">calculated</a> from A and B magnitudes), it is fainter only than <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> and <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>. The next-brightest star in the night sky is <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>. Alpha Centauri is a multiple-star system, with its two main stars being Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B , usually defined to identify them as the different components of the binary . A third companion—<a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a> (or Proxima or )—is much further away than the distance between stars A and B, but is still gravitationally associated with the AB system. As viewed from Earth, it is located at an <a href="angular%20separation">angular separation</a> of 2.2° from the two main stars. Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a separate star from if it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope. Alpha Centauri AB and Proxima Centauri form a "visual" <a href="double%20star">double star</a>. Together, the three components make a triple <a href="star%20system">star system</a>, referred to by double-star observers as the <a href="triple%20star">triple star</a> (or multiple star), .

Together, the bright visible components of the <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system are called Alpha Centauri AB . This "AB" designation denotes the apparent gravitational centre of the main binary system relative to other companion star(s) in any multiple star system. "AB-C" refers to the orbit of Proxima around the central binary, being the distance between the centre of gravity and the outlying companion. Some older references use the confusing and now discontinued designation of A×B. Because the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri AB does not differ significantly from either star, gravitationally this binary system is considered as if it were one object.

<a href="Asteroseismology">Asteroseismic</a> studies, <a href="chromospheric%20activity">chromospheric activity</a>, and stellar rotation (<a href="gyrochronology">gyrochronology</a>), are all consistent with the α Cen system being similar in age to, or slightly older than, the Sun, with typical ages quoted between 4.5 and 7 billion years (<a href="Byr">Gyr</a>). Asteroseismic analyses that incorporate the tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for α Cen A and/or B have yielded age estimates of  Gyr,  Gyr, 5.2–7.1 Gyr, 6.4 Gyr, and  Gyr. Age estimates for stars A and B based on chromospheric activity (Calcium H & K emission) yield 4.4–6.5 Gyr, whereas gyrochronology yields  Gyr.

Alpha Centauri A, also known as Rigil Kentaurus, is the principal member, or "primary", of the binary system, being slightly larger and more luminous than the Sun. It is a solar-like <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star with a similar yellowish colour, whose <a href="stellar%20classification">stellar classification</a> is <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> G2 V. From the determined mutual orbital parameters, Alpha Centauri A is about 10 percent more massive than the Sun, with a radius about 22 percent larger. The <a href="stellar%20rotation">projected rotational velocity</a> of this star is , resulting in an estimated rotational period of 22 days, which gives it a slightly faster rotational period than the Sun's 25 days. When considered among the individual <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">brightest stars</a> in the sky (excluding the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>), Alpha Centauri A is the fourth brightest at an apparent visual magnitude of +0.01, being fractionally fainter than Arcturus at an apparent visual magnitude of −0.04.

Alpha Centauri B is the companion star, or "secondary", of the binary system, and is slightly smaller and less luminous than the Sun. It is a main-sequence star of spectral type K1 V, making it more an orange colour than the primary star. Alpha Centauri B is about 90 percent the mass of the Sun and 14 percent smaller in radius. The projected rotational velocity is , resulting in an estimated rotational period of 41 days. (An earlier, 1995 estimate gave a similar rotation period of 36.8 days.) Although it has a lower luminosity than component A, star B emits more energy in the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> band. The <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a> of B varies on a short time scale and there has been at least one observed flare. Alpha Centauri B at an apparent visual magnitude of 1.33 would be twenty-first in brightness if it could be seen independently of Alpha Centauri A.

Alpha Centauri C, also known as <a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a>, is of <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> M6 Ve, a small main-sequence star (Type V) with <a href="emission%20lines">emission lines</a>. Its B−V <a href="colour%20index">colour index</a> is +1.82 and its mass is about 0.123 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es (), or 129 <a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jupiter mass</a>es.

The two Alpha Centauri AB binary stars are too close together to be resolved by the naked eye, because the angular separation varies between 2 and 22 arcsec (the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec), but through much of the orbit, both are easily resolved in binoculars or small telescopes.

In the southern hemisphere, Alpha Centauri forms the outer star of "The Pointers" or "The Southern Pointers", so called because the line through <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a> (Hadar/Agena),
some 4.5<a href="degree%20%28angle%29">°</a> west, points directly to the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Crux">Crux</a>—the <a href="Southern%20Cross">Southern Cross</a>. The Pointers easily distinguish the true Southern Cross from the fainter <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> known as the <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">False Cross</a>.

South of about <a href="29th%20parallel%20south">29° S latitude</a>, Alpha Centauri is <a href="Circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> and never sets below the horizon. Both stars and Crux are too far south to be visible for mid-latitude northern observers. Below about <a href="29th%20parallel%20north">29° N latitude</a> to the equator (roughly <a href="Hermosillo">Hermosillo</a>, <a href="Chihuahua%20City">Chihuahua City</a> in Mexico, <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston, Texas</a>, <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala, Florida</a> and <a href="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a>, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> of Spain) during the northern summer, Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon. The star <a href="Culmination">culminates</a> each year at midnight on 24 April or 9 p.m. on 8 June.

As seen from Earth, Proxima Centauri is 2.2° southwest from Alpha Centauri AB. This is about four times the <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a> of the Full Moon, and almost exactly half the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and Beta Centauri. Proxima usually appears as a deep-red star of an apparent visual magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field, requiring moderately sized telescopes to see. Listed as V645 Cen in the "<a href="General%20Catalogue%20of%20Variable%20Stars">General Catalogue of Variable Stars (G.C.V.S.) Version 4.2</a>", this <a href="UV%20Ceti">UV Ceti</a>-type <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a> can unexpectedly brighten rapidly by as much as 0.6 magnitudes at visual wavelengths, then fade after only a few minutes. Some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes. In August 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star occurred, with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on August 13.

English explorer <a href="Robert%20Hues">Robert Hues</a> brought Alpha Centauri to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work "Tractatus de Globis", along with <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a> and <a href="Achernar">Achernar</a>, noting "Now, therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call <a href="Canopus">Canobus</a>. The <a href="Achernar">second</a> is in the end of <a href="Eridanus%20%28constellation%29">Eridanus</a>. The third [Alpha Centauri] is in the right foote of the Centaure."

The binary nature of Alpha Centauri AB was first recognized in December 1689 by astronomer and Jesuit priest <a href="Jean%20Richaud">Jean Richaud</a>. The finding was made incidentally while observing a passing <a href="comet">comet</a> from his station in <a href="Puducherry">Puducherry</a>. Alpha Centauri was only the second binary star system to be discovered, preceded by <a href="Alpha%20Crucis">Alpha Crucis</a>.

By 1752, French astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> made <a href="astrometric">astrometric</a> positional measurements using state-of-the-art instruments of that time. Its large proper motion was discovered by <a href="Manuel%20John%20Johnson">Manuel John Johnson</a>, observing from <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, who informed <a href="Thomas%20Henderson%20%28astronomer%29">Thomas Henderson</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Observatory%2C%20Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope</a> of it. The parallax of Alpha Centauri was subsequently determined by Henderson from many exacting positional observations of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld his results, however, because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published them in 1839 after <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Bessel">Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel</a> released his own accurately determined parallax for <a href="61%20Cygni">61 Cygni</a> in 1838. For this reason, Alpha Centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because Henderson's work was not fully recognized at first. (The distance of Alpha is now reckoned at .)

Later, <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> made the first <a href="Micrometer">micrometrical</a> observations in 1834. Since the early 20th century, measures have been made with <a href="photographic%20plates">photographic plates</a>.

By 1926, South African astronomer <a href="William%20Stephen%20Finsen">William Stephen Finsen</a> calculated the approximate <a href="Orbital%20elements">orbit elements</a> close to those now accepted for this system. All future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star <a href="ephemeris">ephemeris</a>. Others, like the Belgian astronomer D. Pourbaix (2002), have regularly refined the precision of any new published orbital elements.

Alpha Centauri is inside the <a href="G-cloud">G-cloud</a>, and the nearest known system to it is the binary <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> system <a href="Luhman%2016">Luhman 16</a> at .

Scottish astronomer <a href="Robert%20T.%20A.%20Innes">Robert T. A. Innes</a> discovered Proxima Centauri in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a dedicated <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> survey. This showed the large proper motion and parallax of the star was similar in both size and direction to those of Alpha Centauri AB, suggesting immediately it was part of the system and slightly closer to Earth than Alpha Centauri AB. Lying away, Proxima Centauri is the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">nearest star</a> to the Sun. All current derived distances for the three stars are from the <a href="parallax">parallax</a>es obtained from the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> star catalogue (HIP) and the Hubble Space Telescope.

With the orbital period of 79.91 years, the A and B components of this binary star can approach each other to , or about the mean distance between the Sun and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>; and may recede as far as , approximately the distance from the Sun to <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a>. This is a consequence of the binary's moderate <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> "e" = 0.5179. From the <a href="orbital%20elements">orbital elements</a>, the total mass of both stars is about —or twice that of the Sun. The average individual stellar masses are and , respectively, though slightly higher masses have been quoted in recent years, such as and , or totalling . Alpha Centauri A and B have <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a>s of +4.38 and +5.71, respectively. <a href="Stellar%20evolution">Stellar evolution</a> theory implies both stars are slightly older than the Sun at 5 to 6 billion years, as derived by both mass and their spectral characteristics.

Viewed from Earth, the "apparent orbit" of this binary star means that its separation and <a href="position%20angle">position angle</a> (PA) are in continuous change throughout its projected orbit. Observed stellar positions in 2010 are separated by 6.74 <a href="Microarcsecond">arcsec</a> through the PA of 245.7°, reducing to 6.04 arcsec through 251.8° in 2011. The closest recent approach was in February 2016, at 4.0 arcsec through 300°. The observed maximum separation of these stars is about 22 arcsec, while the minimum distance is 1.7 arcsec. The widest separation occurred during February 1976 and the next will be in January 2056.

In the "true orbit", closest approach or <a href="apsis">periastron</a> was in August 1955, and next in May 2035. Furthest orbital separation at <a href="apsis">apastron</a> last occurred in May 1995 and the next will be in 2075. The apparent distance between the two stars is rapidly decreasing, at least until 2019.

The much fainter <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> Proxima Centauri, or simply Proxima, is about 13,000 astronomical units (AU) away from Alpha Centauri AB. This is equivalent to —about 5% the distance between Alpha Centauri AB and the Sun. Due to the large distance between Proxima and Alpha, it was long unknown whether they were gravitationally bound. The true orbital speed is necessarily small, and it was necessary to measure the speeds of Proxima and Alpha with a great precision. Otherwise it was impossible to ascertain whether Proxima is bound to Alpha or whether it is a completely unrelated star that happens to be undergoing a close approach at a low relative speed. Probability suggested that such low speed approaches would be rare and unlikely, but it could not be ruled out.

It was only in 2017 that a paper by Kervella, et al., showed that, based on high precision radial velocity measurements and with a high degree of confidence, Proxima and Alpha Centauri are in fact gravitationally bound. The orbital period of Proxima is approximately 550,000 years, with an eccentricity of . Proxima comes within of Alpha Centauri AB at periastron, and the apastron occurs at .

Proxima is a red dwarf of <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral class</a> M6 Ve with an <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of +15.60, which is only a small fraction of the Sun's luminosity. By mass, Proxima is calculated as (rounded to ) or about one-eighth that of the Sun.

All components of Alpha Centauri display significant <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>s against the background sky, similar to the first-magnitude stars Sirius and Arcturus. Over the centuries, this causes the apparent stellar positions to slowly change. Such motions define the "high-proper-motion stars". These stellar motions were unknown to ancient astronomers. Most assumed that all stars were immortal and permanently fixed on the <a href="Celestial%20Sphere">celestial sphere</a>, as stated in the works of the philosopher Aristotle.

<a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> in 1718 found that some stars had significantly moved from their ancient <a href="astrometric">astrometric</a> positions. For example, the bright star <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> (α Boo) in the constellation of <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a> showed an almost 0.5° difference in 1800 years, as did the brightest star, <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, in <a href="Canis%20Major">Canis Major</a> (α CMa). Halley's positional comparison was <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s catalogue of stars contained in the <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a> whose original data included portions from an earlier catalogue by <a href="Hipparchos">Hipparchos</a> during the . Halley's proper motions were mostly for northern stars, so the southern star Alpha Centauri was not determined until the early 19th century.

Scottish-born observer <a href="Thomas%20Henderson%20%28astronomer%29">Thomas Henderson</a> in the 1830s at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope discovered the true distance to Alpha Centauri. He soon realized this system displayed an unusually high proper motion, and therefore its observed true velocity through space should be much larger. In this case, the apparent stellar motion was found using <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a>'s astrometric observations of 1751–1752, by the observed differences between the two measured positions in different epochs. Using the <a href="Hipparcos%20Catalogue">Hipparcos Star Catalogue</a> (HIP) data, the mean individual proper motions are −3678 mas/yr or −3.678 arcsec per year in <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> and +481.84 mas/yr or 0.48184 arcsec per year in <a href="declination">declination</a>. As proper motions are cumulative, the motion of Alpha Centauri is about 6.1 <a href="arcmin">arcmin</a> each century, and 61.3 arcmin or 1.02<a href="degree%20%28angle%29">°</a> each <a href="millennium">millennium</a>. These motions are about one-fifth and twice, respectively, the diameter of the full <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Using <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> the mean radial velocity has been determined to be around 20 km/s towards the Solar System.

As the stars of Alpha Centauri approach the Solar System, the measured proper motion and trigonometric parallax slowly increase. Changes are also observed in the size of the semi-major axis of the orbital <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>, increasing by 0.03 arcsec per century. This small effect is gradually decreasing until the star system is at its closest to Earth, and is then reversed as the distance increases again. Consequently, the observed position angles of the stars are subject to changes in the <a href="orbital%20elements">orbital elements</a> over time, as first determined by W. H. van den Bos in 1926. Some slight differences of about 0.5 percent in the measured proper motions are caused by Alpha Centauri AB's orbital motion.

Based on these observed proper motions and radial velocities, Alpha Centauri will continue to gradually brighten, passing just north of the <a href="Southern%20Cross">Southern Cross</a> or <a href="Crux">Crux</a>, before moving northwest and up towards the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a> and away from the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a>. By about 29,700 <a href="AD">AD</a>, in the present-day constellation of <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>, Alpha Centauri will be away. Then it will reach the stationary radial velocity (RVel) of 0.0 km/s and the maximum apparent magnitude of −0.86v (which is comparable to present-day magnitude of <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>). Even during the time of this nearest approach, however, the apparent magnitude of Alpha Centauri will still not surpass that of Sirius, which will brighten incrementally over the next 60,000 years, and will continue to be the brightest star as seen from Earth for the next 210,000 years.

The Alpha Centauri system will then begin to move away from the Solar System, showing a positive radial velocity. Because of visual <a href="Perspective%20%28visual%29">perspective</a>, about 100,000 years from now, these stars will reach a final <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a> and slowly disappear among the countless stars of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Here this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of <a href="Telescopium">Telescopium</a>. This unusual location results from the fact that Alpha Centauri's orbit around the galactic centre is highly tilted with respect to the plane of the Milky Way.

In about 4000 years, the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of Alpha Centauri will mean that from the point of view of Earth it will appear close enough to Beta Centauri to form an optical double star. Beta Centauri is in reality far more distant than Alpha Centauri.

In August 2016, the European Southern Observatory announced the discovery of a planet slightly larger than the Earth orbiting Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri b was found using the radial velocity method, where periodic Doppler shifts of spectral lines of the host star suggest an orbiting object. From these readings, the radial velocity of the parent star relative to the Earth is varying with an amplitude of about per second. The planet lies in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, but it is possible that the planet is tidally locked to the star, resulting in temperature extremes that would be difficult for life to overcome.

In 2012, a planet around Alpha Centauri B was announced, but in 2015 a new analysis concluded that it almost certainly does not exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis.

On 25 March 2015, a scientific paper by Demory and colleagues published transit results for Alpha Centauri B using the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> for a total of 40 hours. They evidenced a transit event possibly corresponding to a planetary body with a radius around . This planet would most likely orbit Alpha Centauri B with an orbital period of 20.4 days or less, with only a 5 percent chance of it having a longer orbit. The median average of the likely orbits is 12.4 days with an impact parameter of around 0–0.3. Its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less. Like the probably spurious Alpha Centauri Bb, it likely has lakes of molten lava and would be far too close to Alpha Centauri B to harbour life.

The discovery of <a href="exoplanet">planets orbiting other star systems</a>, including similar binary systems (<a href="Gamma%20Cephei">Gamma Cephei</a>), raises the possibility that additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha Centauri A or Alpha Centauri B individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Because both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> or star <a href="Astronomical%20transit">transit</a> methods in their searches around these two bright stars. All the observational studies have so far failed to find any evidence for <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s or <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s.

In 2009, computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of Alpha Centauri B's habitable zone, which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 AU from the star. Certain special assumptions, such as considering that Alpha Centauri A and B may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense <a href="Open%20cluster">star cluster</a>) would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star. Bodies around A would be able to orbit at slightly farther distances due to A's stronger gravity. In addition, the lack of any brown dwarfs or gas giants in close orbits around A or B make the likelihood of terrestrial planets greater than otherwise. Theoretical studies on the detectability via radial velocity analysis have shown that a dedicated campaign of high-cadence observations with a 1-meter class telescope can reliably detect a hypothetical planet of in the habitable zone of B within three years.

Radial velocity measurements of Alpha Centauri B with <a href="High%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher">High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher</a> <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a> ruled out planets of more than to the distance of the habitable zone of the star (orbital period P = 200 days).

Current estimates place the probability of finding an earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri A or B at roughly 85%, although this number remains uncertain.

Early computer-generated models of planetary formation predicted the existence of <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s around <a href="Circumbinary%20planet">both Alpha Centauri A and B</a>, but most recent numerical investigations have shown that the gravitational pull of the companion star renders the accretion of planets very difficult. Despite these difficulties, given the similarities to the Sun in <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a>s, star type, age and probable stability of the orbits, it has been suggested that this stellar system could hold one of the best possibilities for harbouring <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a> on a potential planet.

In the Solar System both Jupiter and Saturn were probably crucial in perturbing <a href="comet">comet</a>s into the inner Solar System. Here, the comets provided the inner planets with their own source of water and various other ices. In the Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the Alpha Centauri system was forming, enriching the area around Alpha Centauri A and B with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha Centauri B happened to have gas giants orbiting Alpha Centauri A (or conversely, Alpha Centauri A for Alpha Centauri B), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably have done in the Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>s of other planetary systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards. There is no direct evidence yet of the existence of such an Oort cloud around Alpha Centauri AB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.

To be in the star's <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>, any suspected planet around Alpha Centauri A would have to be optimally placed about 1.25 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a> away  – about halfway between the distances of Earth's orbit and <a href="Mars">Mars</a>'s orbit in the Solar System – so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist. For the slightly less luminous and cooler Alpha Centauri B, the habitable zone would lie closer at about , approximately the distance that <a href="Venus">Venus</a> is from the Sun.

With the goal of finding evidence of such planets, both Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri AB were among the listed "Tier 1" target stars for <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Space%20Interferometry%20Mission">Space Interferometry Mission</a> (SIM). Detecting planets as small as three Earth-masses or smaller within two <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s of a "Tier 1" target would have been possible with this new instrument. The SIM mission, however, was cancelled due to financial issues in 2010.

Based on observations between 2007 and 2012, a study found a slight excess of emissions in the 24 µm (mid/far-infrared) band surrounding , which may be interpreted as evidence for a sparse <a href="circumstellar%20disc">circumstellar disc</a> or dense <a href="interplanetary%20dust%20cloud">interplanetary dust</a>. The total mass was estimated to be between to the mass of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, or 10-100 times the mass of the Solar System's <a href="zodiacal%20cloud">zodiacal cloud</a>. If such a disc existed around both stars, disc would likely be stable to 2.8 AU, and would likely be stable to 2.5 AU. This would put A's disc entirely within the <a href="frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, and a small part of B's outer disc just outside.

Viewed from near the Alpha Centauri system, the sky would appear very much as it does for an observer on Earth, except that Centaurus would be missing its brightest star. The Sun would be a yellow star of an apparent visual magnitude of +0.5 in eastern <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28constellation%29">Cassiopeia</a>, at the <a href="antipodal%20point">antipodal point</a> of Alpha Centauri's current <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> and <a href="declination">declination</a>, at (2000). This place is close to the 3.4-magnitude star <a href="Epsilon%20Cassiopeiae">ε Cassiopeiae</a>. Because of the placement of the Sun, an interstellar or alien observer would find the \/\/ of Cassiopeia had become a /\/\/ shape nearly in front of the <a href="Heart%20Nebula">Heart Nebula</a> in Cassiopeia. Sirius lies less than a degree from <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> in the otherwise unmodified <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> and with a magnitude of −1.2 is a little fainter than from Earth but still the brightest star in the Alpha Centauri sky. <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a> is also displaced into the middle of <a href="Gemini%20%28constellation%29">Gemini</a>, outshining <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a>, whereas both <a href="Vega">Vega</a> and <a href="Altair">Altair</a> are shifted northwestward relative to <a href="Deneb">Deneb</a> (which barely moves, due to its great distance), giving the <a href="Summer%20Triangle">Summer Triangle</a> a more <a href="equilateral">equilateral</a> appearance.

From Proxima Centauri b, Alpha Centauri AB would appear like two close bright stars with the combined apparent magnitude of −6.8. Depending on the binary's orbital position, the bright stars would appear noticeably divisible to the naked eye, or occasionally, but briefly, as a single unresolved star. Based on the calculated <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a>s, the visual apparent magnitudes of Alpha Centauri A and B would be −6.5 and −5.2, respectively.

An observer on a hypothetical planet orbiting around either Alpha Centauri A or Alpha Centauri B would see the other star of the binary system as an intensely bright object in the night sky, showing a small but discernible disk while near periapse: A up to 210 arc seconds, B up to 155 arc seconds. Near apoapse, the disc would shrink to 60 arc seconds for A, 43 arc seconds for B, being too small to resolve by naked eye. In any case, the dazzling surface brightness could make the discs harder to resolve than a similarly sized less bright object.

For example, some theoretical planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha Centauri A (so that the star appears roughly as bright as the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha Centauri B orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) <a href="year">a</a>), the planet's own <a href="orbital%20period">orbital period</a>. Added to this would be the changing apparent position of Alpha Centauri B during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha Centauri A. (The average speed, at 4.5 degrees per Earth year, is comparable in speed to <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> here. With the eccentricity of the orbit, the maximum speed near periapse, about 18 degrees per Earth year, is faster than Saturn, but slower than Jupiter. The minimum speed near apoapse, about 1.8 degrees per Earth year, is slower than Neptune.) Depending on its and the planet's position on their respective orbits, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual apparent magnitudes are much dimmer than the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of the Sun as viewed from the Earth (−26.7). The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha Centauri B would appear, on a linear scale, 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha Centauri A (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the full <a href="Moon">Moon</a> as seen from the Earth (−12.5).

Also, if another similar planet orbited at 0.71 AU from Alpha Centauri B (so that in turn Alpha Centauri B appeared as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha Centauri A, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha Centauri B (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha Centauri A would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During the orbital period of such a planet of 0.6(3) <a href="year">a</a>, an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as humans see with the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>'s planets. Furthermore, Alpha Centauri A's <a href="orbital%20period">sidereal period</a> of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> as slowly as <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha Centauri A is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>.

An observer on the hypothetical planet would notice a change in orientation to <a href="very-long-baseline%20interferometry">very-long-baseline interferometry</a> reference points commensurate with the binary orbit periodicity plus or minus any local effects such as <a href="precession">precession</a> or <a href="nutation">nutation</a>.

Assuming this hypothetical planet had a low orbital inclination with respect to the mutual orbit of Alpha Centauri A and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at "stellar" <a href="Conjunction%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">conjunction</a>. Half the period later, at "stellar" <a href="Opposition%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">opposition</a>, both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. As a net result, both the local sun and the other star would each be in the sky for half a day, like Sun and Moon are both above the horizon for half a day. But during stellar conjunction, the other star being "new" would be in the sky during daytime, while during the opposition, the other star being "full" would be in the sky for the whole night. In an Earth-like atmosphere, the light of the other star would be appreciably scattered, causing the sky to be perceptibly blue though darker than during daytime, like during twilight or total solar eclipse. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain, and reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light. Over the following half period, the secondary star would be in the sky for a progressively decreasing part of the night (and an increasing part of the day) until at the next conjunction the secondary star would only be in the sky during daytime near the primary star.

From a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A or B, Proxima Centauri would appear as a fourth to fifth magnitude star, as bright as the faint stars of the constellation of <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a>.
In modern literature, "Rigil Kent" (also "Rigel Kent" and variants; ) and "Toliman", were cited as colloquial alternative names of Alpha Centauri.

"Rigil Kent" is short for "Rigil Kentaurus", which is sometimes further abbreviated to "Rigil" or "Rigel", though that is ambiguous with <a href="Rigel">Beta Orionis</a>, which is also called Rigel. Although the short form "Rigel Kent" is often cited as an alternative name, the star system is most widely referred to by its <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> "Alpha Centauri."

The name "Toliman" originates with <a href="Jacobus%20Golius">Jacobus Golius</a>' edition of <a href="Ahmad%20ibn%20Muhammad%20ibn%20Kathir%20al-Farghani">Al-Farghani</a>'s "Compendium" (published posthumously in 1669). "Tolimân" is Golius' latinization of the Arabic name "the ostriches", the name of an asterism of which Alpha Centauri formed the main star.

During the 19th century, the northern amateur popularist Elijah H. Burritt used the now-obscure name "Bungula", possibly coined from "β" and the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ungula" ("hoof").

Together, Alpha and Beta Centauri form the "Southern Pointers" or "The Pointers", as they point towards the Southern Cross, the <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> of the constellation of <a href="Crux">Crux</a>.

In <a href="Standard%20Mandarin%20Chinese">Standard Mandarin Chinese</a>, "Nán Mén", meaning "<a href="Horn%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Southern Gate</a>", refers to an asterism consisting of α Centauri and <a href="Epsilon%20Centauri">ε Centauri</a>. Consequently, α Centauri itself is known as "Nán Mén Èr", the Second Star of the Southern Gate.

To the <a href="Australian%20aboriginal">Australian aboriginal</a> <a href="Wergaia">Boorong people</a> of northwestern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, Alpha and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a> are "Bermbermgle", two brothers noted for their courage and destructiveness, who speared and killed "Tchingal" "The Emu" (the <a href="Coalsack%20Nebula">Coalsack Nebula</a>). The form in <a href="Wergaia">Wotjobaluk</a> is "Bram-bram-bult".
Alpha Centauri is envisioned as a likely first target for manned or unmanned <a href="Interstellar%20travel">interstellar exploration</a>. Crossing the huge distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri using current spacecraft technologies would take several millennia, though the possibility of <a href="nuclear%20pulse%20propulsion">nuclear pulse propulsion</a> or laser <a href="light%20sail">light sail</a> technology, as considered in the <a href="Breakthrough%20Starshot">Breakthrough Starshot</a> program, could reduce the journey time to a matter of decades.

Breakthrough Starshot is a proof-of-concept initiative to send a fleet of ultra-fast light-driven nanocraft to explore the Alpha Centauri system, which could pave the way for a first launch within the next generation. An objective of the mission would be to make a fly-by of, and possibly photograph, any planets that might exist in the system. <a href="Proxima%20Centauri%20b">Proxima Centauri b</a>, announced by the <a href="European%20Southern%20Observatory">European Southern Observatory</a> (ESO) in August 2016, would be a target for the Starshot program.

In January 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives and the ESO entered a collaboration to enable and implement a search for habitable planets in the Alpha Centauri system. The agreement involves Breakthrough Initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the <a href="https%3A//www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/vlt-instr/visir/">VISIR</a> (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-Infrared) instrument on ESO's <a href="Very%20Large%20Telescope">Very Large Telescope</a> (VLT) in Chile. This upgrade will greatly increase the likelihood of planet detection in the system.

Amiga

The Amiga is a family of <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s sold by <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore</a> starting in 1985. The original model was part of a wave of 16 and 32 bit computers that featured 256KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems. This wave included the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a>—released the same year—Apple's <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>, and later the <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple IIGS</a>. Based on the <a href="Motorola%2068000%20series">Motorola 68000</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> and a <a href="blitter">blitter</a>, and a <a href="pre-emptive%20multitasking">pre-emptive multitasking</a> operating system called <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a>.

The <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a> was officially released in July 1985, but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a>, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold. The <a href="Amiga%203000">A3000</a>, introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga systems, followed by the <a href="Amiga%20500%20Plus">A500+</a>, and the <a href="Amiga%20600">A600</a> in March 1992. Finally, as the third generation, the <a href="Amiga%201200">A1200</a> and the <a href="Amiga%204000">A4000</a> were released in late 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and <a href="demo%20%28computer%20programming%29">programming demo</a>s. It also found a prominent role in the <a href="desktop%20video">desktop video</a>, <a href="video%20production">video production</a>, and <a href="show%20control">show control</a> business, leading to video editing systems such as the <a href="Video%20Toaster">Video Toaster</a>. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early <a href="Music%20tracker">tracker</a> music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including <a href="LightWave%203D">LightWave 3D</a>, <a href="Imagine%20%283D%20modeling%20software%29">Imagine</a>, <a href="Aladdin4D">Aladdin4D</a>, and <a href="TurboSilver">TurboSilver</a>.

Although early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the <a href="Amiga%20Sidecar">Amiga Sidecar</a> PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software. Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the <a href="Fourth%20generation%20of%20video%20game%20consoles">fourth generation game consoles</a>, <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a>, and the rapidly dropping prices of <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">IBM PC compatible</a>s which gained 256 color VGA graphics in 1987. Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after the <a href="Amiga%20CD32">Amiga CD32</a> model failed in the marketplace.

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including <a href="Genesi">Genesi</a>, <a href="Eyetech">Eyetech</a>, <a href="ACube%20Systems%20Srl">ACube Systems Srl</a> and A-EON Technology. Likewise, AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as <a href="MorphOS">MorphOS</a>, <a href="AmigaOS%204">AmigaOS 4</a> and <a href="AROS%20Research%20Operating%20System">AROS</a>.

<a href="Jay%20Miner">Jay Miner</a> joined <a href="Atari">Atari</a> in the 1970s to develop custom <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s, and led development of the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>'s <a href="Television%20Interface%20Adaptor">TIA</a>. Almost as soon as its development was complete, the team began developing a much more sophisticated set of chips, <a href="CTIA%20and%20GTIA">CTIA</a>, <a href="ANTIC">ANTIC</a> and <a href="POKEY">POKEY</a>, that formed the basis of the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a>.

With the 8-bit line's launch in 1979, the team once again started looking at a next generation chipset. <a href="Nolan%20Bushnell">Nolan Bushnell</a> had sold the company to <a href="Warner%20Communications">Warner Communications</a> in 1978, and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales. Miner wanted to start work with the new <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a>, but management was only interested in another <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">6502</a> based system. Miner left the company, and the industry.

In 1979, <a href="Larry%20Kaplan">Larry Kaplan</a> left Atari and founded <a href="Activision">Activision</a>. In 1982, Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform. Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company, "Hi-Toro". The system was code-named "Lorraine" in keeping with Miner's policy of giving systems female names, in this case the company president's wife, Lorraine Morse. When Kaplan left the company late in 1982, Miner was promoted to head engineer and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation.

A breadboard prototype was largely completed by late 1983, and shown at the January 1984 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) with the <a href="Demo%20%28computer%20programming%29%23The%20bouncing%20ball">Boing Ball demo</a>. A further developed version was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the <a href="North%20American%20video%20game%20crash%20of%201983">North American video game crash of 1983</a>.

In March, Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the 1850XLD. But the talks were progressing slowly, and Amiga was running out of money. A temporary arrangement led to a $500,000 loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going. The terms required the loan to be repaid in one month, otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari.

During 1983, Atari lost over $1 million a week, due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market. Warner became desperate to sell the company. <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> resigned from Commodore in January 1984 due to internal battles over the future direction of the company. In June, Tramiel arranged a no-cash deal to take over Atari and reformed it as Atari Corporation.

Tramiel's purchase of Atari resulted in a considerable number of Commodore employees following him, including a number of the senior technical staff. This left Commodore with no workable path to a next generation computer. The company approached Amiga offering to fund development as a home computer system. They quickly arranged to repay the Atari loan, ending that threat. The two companies were initially arranging a $4 million license agreement before Commodore offered $24 million to purchase Amiga outright.

By late 1984 the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits, and the system hardware was being readied for production. At this time the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> (OS) was not as ready, and led to a deal to port an OS known as <a href="TRIPOS">TRIPOS</a> to the platform. TRIPOS was a <a href="Computer%20multitasking">multitasking</a> system that had been written in <a href="BCPL">BCPL</a> during the 1970s for <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a> systems like the <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>, but later experimentally ported to the 68000. This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench. The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> language, and the entire system became AmigaOS.

In common with many contemporaneous <a href="Unix%20workstation">Unix workstation</a>s, the system was enclosed in a <a href="pizza%20box%20form%20factor">pizza box form factor</a> case; a late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a "garage" under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored.

The first model was announced in 1985 as simply "The Amiga from Commodore", later to be retroactively dubbed the <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a>. They were first offered for sale in August, but by October only 50 had been built, all of which were used by Commodore. Machines only began to arrive in quantity in mid-November, meaning they missed the Christmas buying rush. By the end of the year, they had sold 35,000 machines, and severe cashflow problems made the company pull out of the January 1986 CES. Bad or entirely missing marketing, forcing the development team to move to the east coast, notorious stability problems and other blunders limited sales in early 1986 to between 10,000 and 15,000 units a month.

In late 1985 <a href="Thomas%20Rattigan">Thomas Rattigan</a> was promoted to <a href="Chief%20operating%20officer">COO</a> of Commodore, and then to <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> in February 1986. He immediately implemented an ambitious plan that covered almost all of the company's operations. Among these were the long overdue cancelation of the now outdated <a href="Commodore%20PET">PET</a> and <a href="Commodore%20VIC-20">VIC-20</a> lines, as well as a variety of poorly selling <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> offshoots and the <a href="Commodore%20900">Commodore 900</a> <a href="workstation">workstation</a> effort.

Another of the changes was to split the Amiga into two products, a new high-end version of the Amiga aimed at the creative market, and a cost-reduced version that would take over for the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> in the low-end market. These new designs were released in 1987 as the <a href="Amiga%202000">Amiga 2000</a> and <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a>, the latter of which went on to widespread success and became their best selling model.

Similar high-end/low-end models would make up the Amiga line for the rest of its history; follow-on designs included the <a href="Amiga%203000">Amiga 3000</a>/<a href="Amiga%20500%20Plus">Amiga 500 Plus</a>/<a href="Amiga%20600">Amiga 600</a>, and the <a href="Amiga%204000">Amiga 4000</a>/<a href="Amiga%201200">Amiga 1200</a>. These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the <a href="Amiga%20Enhanced%20Chip%20Set">ECS</a> and <a href="Amiga%20Advanced%20Graphics%20Architecture">AGA</a>, which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications.

Ultimately the Amiga line would sell an estimated 4,850,000 machines over its lifetime. The machines were most popular in the UK and Germany, with about 1.5 million sold in each country, and sales in the high hundreds of thousands in other European nations. The machine was less popular in North America, where an estimated 700,000 were sold. In particular, in the U.S. the Amiga did not achieve any success outside of Commodore's traditional enthusiast market except in <a href="vertical%20market">vertical market</a>s for <a href="video%20processing">video processing</a> and editing.

In spite of his successes in making the company profitable and bringing the Amiga line to market, Rattigan was soon forced out in a power struggle with majority shareholder, <a href="Irving%20Gould">Irving Gould</a>. This is widely regarded as the turning point, as further improvements to the Amiga were eroded by rapid improvements in other platforms.

In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by <a href="Escom%20%28computer%20corp%29">Escom</a>, a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new <a href="Motorola%2068060">68060</a> version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997.

The Amiga brand was then sold to a US <a href="Wintel">Wintel</a> PC manufacturer, <a href="Gateway%2C%20Inc.">Gateway 2000</a>, which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, <a href="Amiga%2C%20Inc.">Amiga, Inc.</a>, licensed the rights to sell hardware using the Amiga or <a href="AmigaOne">AmigaOne</a> brand to <a href="Eyetech">Eyetech Group</a>, <a href="Hyperion%20Entertainment">Hyperion Entertainment</a> and <a href="Commodore%20USA">Commodore USA</a>.

At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several <a href="coprocessor">coprocessor</a>s, which handle audio, video and <a href="direct%20memory%20access">direct memory access</a> independently of the <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">Central Processing Unit</a> (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.

The general Amiga architecture uses two distinct <a href="bus%20%28computing%29">bus</a> subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address <a href="Amiga%20Chip%20RAM">"Chip RAM"</a>. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as conventional RAM, ROM and the <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20II">Zorro II</a> or <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20III">Zorro III</a> expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems; the CPU "Fast" bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, "busboards" or "bridgeboards" may provide <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">ISA</a> or <a href="Conventional%20PCI">PCI</a> buses.

The <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> <a href="Motorola%2068000%20family">68000</a> series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While all CPU in the 68000 family have a <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> <a href="Instruction%20Set%20Architecture">ISA</a> design (programmer uses and sees a 32-bit model), the MC68000 used in the most popular models is a <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> (or 16/32-bit) processor because its <a href="Arithmetic%20logic%20unit">ALU</a> operates in 16-bit (32-bit operations require additional clock cycles, consuming more time). The MC68000 has a 16-bit external <a href="Bus%20%28computing%29">data bus</a> so 32-bits of data is transferred in two consecutive steps, a technique called <a href="multiplexing">multiplexing</a>. This is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The MC68000 can address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured higher-speed, full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and <a href="Instruction%20pipelining">instruction pipeline</a> facilities.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and <a href="hard%20disk%20drive">hard disk</a> controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance <a href="Reduced%20instruction%20set%20computing">RISC</a> processors, such as the <a href="PA-RISC">PA-RISC</a>. However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native <a href="microkernel">microkernel</a> and software. Later Amiga clones featured <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> processors only.

The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The <a href="Original%20Chip%20Set">Original Chip Set</a> (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved <a href="Amiga%20Enhanced%20Chip%20Set">Enhanced Chip Set</a> (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit <a href="Amiga%20Advanced%20Graphics%20Architecture">Advanced Graphics Architecture</a> (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several <a href="coprocessor">coprocessor</a>s which handle <a href="blitter">graphics acceleration</a>, digital audio, <a href="direct%20memory%20access">direct memory access</a> and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary <a href="Amiga%20custom%20chips">custom chip</a>s which performed tasks such as <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> control and display de-interlacing.

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (<a href="Amiga%20Halfbrite%20mode">EHB Mode</a>), or 4096 colors (<a href="Amiga%20Hold-and-Modify">HAM Mode</a>). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256, and (<a href="Amiga%20Hold-and-Modify">HAM8 Mode</a>) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to <a href="True%20Color">16.8 million colors</a>.

The Amiga chipset can "<a href="genlock">genlock</a>", which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do <a href="Character%20generator">character generation</a> and <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The <a href="NewTek">NewTek</a> <a href="Video%20Toaster">Video Toaster</a> was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988, the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> monitor with built-in <a href="framebuffer">framebuffer</a> and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024×800 for NTSC and 1024×1024 for PAL).

ReTargetable Graphics is an <a href="application%20programming%20interface">API</a> for <a href="device%20driver">device driver</a>s mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> via a set of <a href="library%20%28computing%29">libraries</a>. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust <a href="Display%20resolution">resolution</a>, screen colors, <a href="Cursor%20%28computers%29%23Mouse%20cursor">pointers</a> and screenmodes. The standard <a href="Intuition%20%28Amiga%29">Intuition interface</a> is limited to <a href="color%20depth">display depths</a> of <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a>s, while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like <a href="24-bit">24-bit</a>s.

The sound chip, named Paula, supports four <a href="pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a>-sample-based sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see <a href="Nyquist%20frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as "<a href="OctaMED">OctaMED</a>" uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.

The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide <a href="Digital%20signal%20processor">DSP</a> functions, multi-track <a href="direct-to-disk%20recording">direct-to-disk recording</a>, multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called <a href="AHI%20%28Amiga%29">AHI</a> was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the <a href="Operating%20system">OS</a> and software.

Kickstart is the <a href="firmware">firmware</a> upon which AmigaOS is <a href="booting">bootstrap</a>ped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a <a href="Booting">bootable</a> <a href="volume%20%28computing%29">volume</a>, such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM-chip</a>.

The keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid 80s IBM PC: Ten function keys, a numeric keypad, and four separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Missing are the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lack function keys completely.

The mouse has two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaces the system <a href="Status%20bar">status line</a> at the top of the screen with a Maclike <a href="menu%20bar">menu bar</a>. As with Apple's <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Mac OS</a> prior to <a href="Mac%20OS%208">Mac OS 8</a>, menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking.

The mouse plugs into one of two <a href="Atari%20joystick%20port">Atari joystick port</a>s used for <a href="joystick">joystick</a>s, <a href="Paddle%20%28game%20controller%29">game paddles</a>, and <a href="graphics%20tablet">graphics tablet</a>s. Although compatible with <a href="analog%20stick">analog joystick</a>s, Atari-style digital joysticks became standard.

The Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include <a href="genlock">genlock</a>s, network cards for <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a>, <a href="modem">modem</a>s, <a href="sound%20card">sound card</a>s and samplers, <a href="Video%20capture">video digitizers</a>, extra <a href="serial%20port">serial port</a>s, and <a href="Parallel%20ATA">IDE</a> controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are <a href="USB">USB</a> cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.

Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the <a href="Motorola%2068020">Motorola 68020</a> and <a href="Motorola%2068030">Motorola 68030</a>, almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with <a href="Floating-point%20unit">FPUs</a> and <a href="Memory%20management%20unit">MMUs</a> or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the <a href="Motorola%2068040">Motorola 68040</a> or <a href="Motorola%2068060">Motorola 68060</a>. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the <a href="PowerUP%20%28accelerator%29">PowerUP</a> boards (<a href="Blizzard%20PPC">Blizzard PPC</a> and <a href="PowerUP%20%28accelerator%29%23Cyberstorm%20PPC">CyberStorm PPC</a>) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run <a href="MAME">MAME</a> for example, but even decoding <a href="JPEG">JPEG</a> pictures and <a href="MP3">MP3</a> audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run <a href="Linux">Linux</a> on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

In the North American market, the "NewTek <a href="Video%20Toaster">Video Toaster</a>" was a video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments. One particularly well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of "<a href="Babylon%205">Babylon 5</a>". Due to its <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a>-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the <a href="PAL">PAL</a> standard, such as in Europe. In those countries, the "OpalVision" card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost <a href="Time%20base%20correction">time base correctors</a> (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200, A3000 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards, <a href="Sound%20Blaster">Sound Blaster</a> sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, USB cards, and television tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by <a href="Richmond%20Sound%20Design">Richmond Sound Design</a> that allow their <a href="show%20control">show control</a> and <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a> software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by either ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See <a href="Amiga%20software">Amiga software</a> for more information on these applications.

Other popular devices included the following:

The Commodore A2232 board provides <a href="serial%20port">serial port</a>s in addition to the Amiga's built-in serial port. Each port can be driven independently at speeds of There is however a driver available on <a href="Aminet">Aminet</a> that allows two of the serial ports to be driven at The serial card used the <a href="CSG%2065CE02">65CE02</a> CPU clocked at . This CPU was also part of the <a href="CSG%2065CE02">CSG 4510</a> CPU core that was used in the <a href="Commodore%2065">Commodore 65</a> computer.

Amiga has three networking interface APIs:

Different network media were used:

The original Amiga models were produced from 1985 to 1996. They are, in order of production: <a href="Amiga%201000">1000</a>, <a href="Amiga%202000">2000</a>, <a href="Amiga%20500">500</a>, <a href="Amiga%201500">1500</a>, <a href="Amiga%202500">2500</a>, <a href="Amiga%203000">3000</a>, <a href="Amiga%203000UX">3000UX</a>, <a href="Amiga%203000T">3000T</a>, <a href="Commodore%20CDTV">CDTV</a>, <a href="Amiga%20500%2B">500+</a>, <a href="Amiga%20600">600</a>, <a href="Amiga%204000">4000</a>, <a href="Amiga%201200">1200</a>, <a href="Amiga%20CD32">CD32</a>, and <a href="Amiga%204000T">4000T</a>. The PowerPC based <a href="AmigaOne">AmigaOne</a> computers were later marketed since 2002. Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga <a href="Clone%20%28computing%29">clones</a> and still do so today.

The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985 and became popular for its impressive graphics, video and audio capabilities. In 2006, <a href="PC%20World">PC World</a> rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating ""Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer"".

Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the <a href="Amiga%202000">Amiga 2000</a> in 1987, the <a href="Amiga%203000">Amiga 3000</a> in 1990, and the <a href="Amiga%204000">Amiga 4000</a> in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a> (1987) and the <a href="Amiga%201200">Amiga 1200</a> (1992). The <a href="Amiga%20500%2B">Amiga 500+</a> (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the <a href="Amiga%20600">Amiga 600</a> (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.

The <a href="Commodore%20CDTV">CDTV</a>, launched in 1991, was a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Like the <a href="Commodore%2064%20Games%20System">Commodore 64GS</a> that was a video game console based on a computer, the CDTV was designed as a video game console and multimedia platform. It had existed before the Sony <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> and <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, but had influenced them. It competed with the <a href="TurboGrafx-16">Turbo-Grafx CD</a> and <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a> system add ons when it was being sold.

Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the <a href="Amiga%20CD32">Amiga CD32</a> (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next generation CDTV, and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market.

Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20B-52%27s">The B-52's</a>. Early A500 units, at least, had the words "B52/ROCK LOBSTER" <a href="Printed%20circuit%20board%23Manufacturing">silk-screen printed</a> onto their <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>, a reference to the popular song "<a href="Rock%20Lobster">Rock Lobster</a>" The <a href="Amiga%20600">Amiga 600</a> referenced "JUNE BUG" (after the song "Junebug") and the <a href="Amiga%201200">Amiga 1200</a> had "CHANNEL Z" (after "<a href="Channel%20Z%20%28song%29">Channel Z</a>")., and the CD-32 had "Spellbound".

Most original casing was made from <a href="Acrylonitrile%20butadiene%20styrene">ABS</a> plastics which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix "<a href="Retr0bright">Retr0bright</a>".

<a href="AmigaOS%204">AmigaOS 4</a> is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based <a href="AmigaOne">AmigaOne</a> computers built by <a href="Eyetech">Eyetech</a> under license by <a href="Amiga%2C%20Inc.">Amiga, Inc.</a>, on the <a href="Pegasos">Pegasos II</a> from <a href="Genesi">Genesi</a>/<a href="Genesi">bPlan GmbH</a>, on the <a href="ACube%20Systems%20Srl">ACube Systems Srl</a> <a href="Sam440ep">Sam440ep</a> / <a href="Sam460ex">Sam460ex</a> / AmigaOne 500 systems and on the A-EON <a href="AmigaOne%20X1000">AmigaOne X1000</a>.

AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and <a href="Hyperion%20Entertainment">Hyperion Entertainment</a> (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems, and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards. The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5. Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.

<a href="Acube%20Systems">Acube Systems</a> entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its <a href="Sam440ep">Sam440ep</a> and <a href="Sam460ex">Sam460ex</a> line of PowerPC-based motherboards. In 2009 a version for <a href="Pegasos%20II">Pegasos II</a> was released in co-operation with Acube Systems. In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the <a href="AmigaOne%20X1000">AmigaOne X1000</a> to consumers through their partner, <a href="Amiga%20Kit">Amiga Kit</a> who provided end-user support, assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system.

Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their DraCo non-linear video editing system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the <a href="Motorola%2068060">Motorola 68060</a> processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support <a href="FireWire">FireWire</a> for video <a href="Input/output">I/O</a>. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20III">Zorro-II</a> expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of transfer rates (faster than Commodore's <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20III">Zorro-III</a>). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard <a href="Drive%20bay%235%25%26quot%3B">5¼" drive bay</a>. It features either a <a href="Motorola%2068020">68020</a> or <a href="Motorola%2068030">68030</a> CPU, with a redesigned <a href="Amiga%20Advanced%20Graphics%20Architecture">AGA</a> chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.

In 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, <a href="Dave%20Haynie">Dave Haynie</a> and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed a new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.

The NatAmi (short for "Native Amiga") hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features. The NatAmi motherboard is a standard <a href="Mini-ITX">Mini-ITX</a>-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale <a href="68060">68060</a> and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA <a href="Altera">Altera</a> chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the <a href="Minimig">Minimig</a> motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the <a href="C-One">C-One</a> mainboard developed by <a href="Jeri%20Ellsworth">Jeri Ellsworth</a> and Jens Schönfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently <a href="Proprietary%20software">closed source</a>. One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in <a href="WinUAE">WinUAE</a>), modern PC <a href="Intel">Intel</a> components, or a modern <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas, such as with <a href="AmigaOne">AmigaOne</a> or <a href="Pegasos">Pegasos</a> computers. This "purist" philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a>s of audio and video graphics RAM as in the <a href="Amiga%20Advanced%20Graphics%20Architecture">AGA chipset</a>, and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern <a href="Field-programmable%20gate%20array">FPGA</a> <a href="Altera">Altera</a> Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed "N68050" that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.

In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using <a href="Field-programmable%20gate%20array">FPGA</a> based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga <a href="Original%20Chip%20Set">OCS</a> custom chipset. The first, the <a href="Minimig">Minimig</a>, is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as "new Amiga hardware", the original model was built on a <a href="Xilinx">Xilinx</a> Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and <a href="Amiga%20custom%20chips%23Gary">Gary</a> chips as well as both 8520 <a href="MOS%20Technology%20CIA">CIAs</a> and implements a simple version of <a href="Amiga%20custom%20chips%23Amber">Amber</a>. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> control. The design for Minimig was released as <a href="Open-source%20software">open-source</a> on July 25, 2007. In February 2008, an Italian company <a href="Acube%20Systems">Acube Systems</a> began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade "Replay" board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about more capacity and which does support the AGA chipset and a <a href="Motorola%2068020">68020</a> <a href="Soft%20core%20%28synthesis%29">soft core</a> with <a href="Motorola%2068030">68030</a> capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by <a href="Individual%20Computers">Individual Computers</a>. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.

Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been emulated so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in <a href="Field-programmable%20gate%20array">FPGA</a> chips.

One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.

AmigaOS is a single-user <a href="Computer%20multitasking">multitasking</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while <a href="AmigaOS%204">AmigaOS 4</a> runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement <a href="Preemption%20%28computing%29">preemptive</a> multitasking.

Another notable feature was the combined use of both a <a href="command-line%20interface">command-line interface</a> and <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a>. <a href="AmigaDOS">AmigaDOS</a> was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and <a href="Workbench%20%28AmigaOS%29">Workbench</a> the native graphical windowing, <a href="Icon%20%28computing%29">icon</a>s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long <a href="filename">filename</a>s (up to 107 characters) with <a href="Whitespace%20character">whitespace</a> and did not require <a href="filename%20extension">filename extension</a>s. The <a href="windowing%20system">windowing system</a> and user interface engine which handles all input events is called <a href="Intuition%20%28Amiga%29">Intuition</a>.

The multi-tasking kernel is called <a href="Exec%20%28Amiga%29">Exec</a>. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 KB of free memory.

AmigaOS is one of the few microkernel-based operating systems not to implement <a href="memory%20protection">memory protection</a>, though this lack is common amongst many of its contemporary operating systems. The lack of memory protection is because the <a href="Motorola%2068000">68000</a> <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> does not include a <a href="memory%20management%20unit">memory management unit</a> and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory. Although this speeds and eases <a href="inter-process%20communication">inter-process communication</a> because programs can communicate by simply passing a <a href="pointer%20%28computer%20programming%29">pointer</a> back and forth, the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to <a href="Crash%20%28computing%29">crashes</a> from badly behaving <a href="Computer%20program">programs</a> than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection, and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in <a href="AmigaOS%204">AmigaOS 4</a> and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> to <a href="PEEK%20and%20POKE">POKE</a> the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new <a href="Advanced%20Graphics%20Architecture">AGA</a> chipset was released, <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore</a> declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. <a href="MorphOS">MorphOS</a> and <a href="AROS%20Research%20Operating%20System">AROS</a> clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced <a href="BeOS">BeOS</a>, which featured a centralized system of <a href="Amiga%20support%20and%20maintenance%20software%23Datatypes">Datatypes</a>, similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, <a href="DragonFly%20BSD">DragonFly BSD</a> was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer. <a href="WindowLab">WindowLab</a> and <a href="amiwm">amiwm</a> are among several <a href="window%20manager">window manager</a>s for the <a href="X%20Window%20System">X Window System</a> seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed OS/2 to have the WPS (Work Place Shell) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0 a 32-bit operating system.

Commodore-Amiga produced <a href="Amiga%20Unix">Amiga Unix</a>, informally known as Amix, based on AT&T <a href="UNIX%20System%20V">SVR4</a>. It supports the <a href="Amiga%202500">Amiga 2500</a> and Amiga 3000 and is included with the <a href="Amiga%203000UX">Amiga 3000UX</a>. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on <a href="Motorola%2068040">68040</a> or <a href="Motorola%2068060">68060</a> processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and <a href="NetBSD">NetBSD</a>. Both require a CPU with <a href="Memory%20management%20unit">MMU</a> such as the <a href="Motorola%2068020">68020</a> with <a href="Motorola%2068851">68851</a> or full versions of the <a href="Motorola%2068030">68030</a>, <a href="Motorola%2068040">68040</a> or <a href="Motorola%2068060">68060</a>. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. <a href="Debian">Debian</a> and <a href="Yellow%20Dog%20Linux">Yellow Dog Linux</a> can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a>. The last Amiga release is 3.2. <a href="MINIX">MINIX</a> 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.

The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> and the <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1 MHz in Monochrome mode. Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the same 68000 CPU as the Macintosh and, using a Macintosh emulator, could run Mac 68K operating systems and programs. However, the Amiga could not directly read Macintosh 3.5" floppies due to their proprietary format. Further, it required a compatible Macintosh for a copy of its ROM. The Atari ST was also emulated. <a href="MAME">MAME</a> (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, <a href="demoscene">demoscene</a> activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a> due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics%20software">3D rendering</a> (ray-tracing) packages, <a href="raster%20graphics%20editor">bitmap graphics editors</a>, <a href="desktop%20video">desktop video</a> software, software development packages and "<a href="Tracker%20%28music%20software%29">tracker</a>" music editors.

Until the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, <a href="Aminet">Aminet</a>, was created in 1992 and until around 1996 was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.

The name "Amiga" was chosen by the developers from the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> word for a female friend, because they knew Spanish, and because it occurred before <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> and <a href="Atari">Atari</a> alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was "user friendly" as a pun or play on words.

The first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double <a href="check%20mark">check mark</a>. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Though it was never adopted as a <a href="trademark">trademark</a> by Commodore, the "Boing Ball" has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom's purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.

Early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:


AmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by <a href="Hyperion%20Entertainment">Hyperion Entertainment</a> and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS, based on some parts of AROS source code, is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> and other PowerPC based hardware.

There is also <a href="AROS%20Research%20Operating%20System">AROS</a>, a free and open source operating system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the <a href="Raspberry%20Pi">Raspberry Pi</a>). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real "classic" hardware.

After Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there remained a very active Amiga community, which continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, "<a href="Amiga%20Format">Amiga Format</a>", continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, "<a href="Amiga%20Active">Amiga Active</a>", was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Several notable magazines are in publication today: "Amiga Future", which is available in both English and German; "Bitplane.it", a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and "AmigaPower", a long-running French magazine.

In spite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine <a href="Micro%20Mart">Micro Mart</a>. There is also a fan website, that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. Other popular English-language "<a href="Internet%20forum">forums</a>" also exist, particularly amiga.org since 1994 and amigaworld.net and English Amiga Board.

The Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:

In addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:


The Amiga was also used in a number of special purpose applications:

Actinophryid

The actinophryids are small, familiar group of <a href="heliozoa">heliozoa</a>ns. They are the most common heliozoa in fresh water, and are especially frequent in lakes and rivers, but a few are found in marine and soil habitats as well. Each actinophryid are unicellular and roughly spherical in shape, without any shell or test, and with many pseudopodia supported by axopods radiating outward from the cell body, which adhere to passing prey and allows it to roll or float about. The outer portion of the cell, or ectoplasm, is distinct and is filled with many tiny <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a>s. The organism regulates buoyancy and maintains homeostasis through the use of <a href="contractile%20vacuoles">contractile vacuoles</a>, which are visible as clear bulges when full.

There are two genera included here. "Actinophrys" have a single, central nucleus. Most are around <a href="1%20E-5%20m">40-50</a> μm in diameter, with axopods up to 100 μm in length, though this varies. "Actinosphaerium" are several times larger, from <a href="1%20E-4%20m">200-1000</a> μm in diameter, with many nuclei, and are found exclusively in fresh water. Two other genera, "Echinosphaerium" and "Camptonema", have been described but appear to be synonyms.

Reproduction takes place by fission, with open <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. Under unfavourable conditions, the organism will form a cyst, which is multi-walled and covered in spikes. While encysted it may undergo a peculiar process of <a href="autogamy">autogamy</a> or self-fertilization, where it goes through <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> and divides to form two gametes, which then fuse together again. This is the only form of <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> that occurs within the group, though it is really more genetic reorganization than reproduction.

The axopods are supported by <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a>s arranged in a unique and characteristic double-coil pattern. In "Actinophrys", these arise from the nuclear membrane, while in "Actinosphaerium" some do and others don't. Other heliozoa where the microtubules arise from the nucleus have been considered possible relatives, and it now appears that the actinophryids developed from <a href="axodine">axodine</a>s such as "<a href="Pedinella">Pedinella</a>". These are specialized <a href="heterokont">heterokont</a> algae, related to <a href="golden%20alga">golden alga</a>e, <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s, <a href="brown%20alga">brown alga</a>e, and the like, which have microtubule-supported tentacles.

Actinophyrys feeds on small flagellates, cilates, and algae, etc.

Originally placed in <a href="Heliozoa">Heliozoa</a> (<a href="Sarcodina">Sarcodina</a>), the group was moved to <a href="Actinochrysophyceae">Actinochrysophyceae</a> (Axodines), or to <a href="Raphidomonadea">Raphidomonadea</a>.

Abel Tasman

Abel Janszoon Tasman (; 1603 – 10 October 1659) was a <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> <a href="sea%20explorer">seafarer</a>, <a href="exploration">explorer</a>, and <a href="merchant">merchant</a>, best known for his voyages of 1642 and 1644 in the service of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> (VOC). He was the first known European explorer to reach the islands of <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land">Van Diemen's Land</a> (now <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>) and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and to sight the <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> islands.

Abel Jans Tasman was born in 1603 in <a href="Lutjegast">Lutjegast</a>, a small village in the <a href="province%20of%20Groningen">province of Groningen</a>, in the north of the Netherlands. The oldest available source mentioning him dates 27 December 1631 when, as a seafarer living in Amsterdam, the 28-year-old became engaged to marry 21-year-old Jannetje Tjaers from the <a href="Jordaan">Jordaan</a> district of the city. In 1633 he sailed from <a href="Texel">Texel</a> to <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), taking the southern <a href="Brouwer%20Route">Brouwer Route</a>. Tasman took part in a voyage to <a href="Seram%20Island">Seram Island</a>; the locals had sold spices to others than the Dutch. He had a narrow escape from death, when in an incautious landing several of his companions were killed by people of Seram. In August 1637 he was back in Amsterdam, and the following year he signed on for another ten years and took his wife with him to Batavia. On 25 March 1638 he tried to sell his property in the <a href="Jordaan">Jordaan</a>, but the purchase was cancelled. In 1639 he was second-in-command of an exploration expedition in the north Pacific under <a href="Matthijs%20Quast">Matthijs Quast</a>. The fleet included the ships "Engel" and "Gracht" and reached <a href="Fort%20Zeelandia%20%28Taiwan%29">Fort Zeelandia</a> (<a href="Dutch%20Formosa">Dutch Formosa</a>) and <a href="Deshima">Deshima</a>.

In August 1642, the Council of the Indies, consisting of <a href="Antonie%20van%20Diemen">Antonie van Diemen</a>, <a href="Cornelis%20van%20der%20Lijn">Cornelis van der Lijn</a>, <a href="Joan%20Maetsuycker">Joan Maetsuycker</a>, <a href="Justus%20Schouten">Justus Schouten</a>, <a href="Salomon%20Sweers">Salomon Sweers</a>, Cornelis Witsen, and Pieter Boreel in Batavia despatched Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on a voyage of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of "all the totally unknown provinces of Beach". This expedition used two small ships, the "Heemskerck" and the "<a href="Zeehaen">Zeehaen</a>".

"Beach" appeared on maps of the time, notably that of <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a> of 1570 and that of <a href="Jan%20Huygen%20van%20Linschoten">Jan Huygen van Linschoten</a> of 1596, as the northernmost part of the southern continent, the "<a href="Terra%20Australis">Terra Australis</a>", along with "Locach". According to <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a>, "Locach" was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it”. "Beach" was in fact a mistranscription of "Locach". Locach was Marco Polo’s name for the southern Thai kingdom of Lavo, or <a href="Lop%20Buri">Lop Buri</a>, the “city of Lavo”, (ลพบุรี, after Lavo, the son of <a href="Rama">Rama</a> in <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a>). In Chinese (<a href="Cantonese">Cantonese</a>), Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” (羅斛), from which Marco Polo took his rendition of the name. In the <a href="Kurrent">German cursive script</a>, “Locach” and “Boeach” look similar, and in the 1532 edition of <a href="The%20Travels%20of%20Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo’s "Travels"</a> his Locach was changed to "Boëach", later shortened to "Beach".

They seem to have drawn on the map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by <a href="Henricus%20Martellus">Henricus Martellus</a>, in which "provincia boëach" appears as the southern neighbour of "provincia ciamba". pageRank.Book III of Marco Polo’s "<a href="Il%20Milione">Il Milione</a>" described his journey by sea from China to India by way of <a href="Champa">Champa</a> (= Southern Vietnam), Java (which he called "<a href="Jave%20la%20Grande">Java Major</a>"), Locach and Sumatra (called "Java Minor"). After a chapter describing the kingdom of Champa there follows a chapter describing <a href="Java">Java</a> (which he did not visit himself). The narrative then resumes, describing the route southward from Champa toward <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, but by a slip of the pen the name “Java” was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure, locating Sumatra 1,300 miles to the south of Java instead of Champa. Locach, located between Champa and Sumatra, was likewise misplaced far to the south of Java, by some geographers on or near an extension of the "Terra Australis".

As explained by Sir <a href="Henry%20Yule">Henry Yule</a>, the editor of an English edition of Marco Polo’s "Travels": “Some geographers of the 16th century, following the old editions which carried the travellers south-east of Java to the land of “Boeach” (or Locac), introduced in their maps a continent in that situation”. <a href="Gerard%20Mercator">Gerard Mercator</a> did just that on his 1541 globe, placing "Beach provincia aurifera" (“Beach the gold-bearing province”) in the northernmost part of the "Terra Australis" in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo’s "Travels".

It remained in this location on his world map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, "Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem" (“Beach the gold-bearing province, whither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people”) with "Lucach regnum" shown somewhat to its south west. Following Mercator, <a href="Abraham%20Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</a> also showed "BEACH" and "LVCACH" in these locations on his world map of 1571. Likewise, Linschoten’s very popular 1596 map of the East Indies showed "BEACH" projecting from the map’s southern edge, leading (or misleading) Visscher and Tasman in their voyage of 1642 to seek Beach with its plentiful gold in a location to the south of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> somewhere between <a href="Staten%20Land">Staten Land</a> near <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> and the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>.

Confirmation that land existed where the maps showed "Beach" to be had come from <a href="Dirk%20Hartog">Dirk Hartog</a>’s landing in October 1616 on its west coast, which he called <a href="Eendrachtsland">Eendrachtsland</a> after the name of his ship.

In accordance with Visscher's directions, Tasman sailed from Batavia on 14 August 1642 and arrived at <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> on 5 September 1642, according to the captain's journal. The reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island; there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships. Tasman got the assistance of the governor <a href="Adriaan%20van%20der%20Stel">Adriaan van der Stel</a>. Because of the prevailing winds Mauritius was chosen as a turning point. After a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 October using the <a href="Roaring%20Forties">Roaring Forties</a> to sail east as fast as possible. (No one had gone as far as <a href="Pieter%20Nuyts">Pieter Nuyts</a> in 1626/27.) On 7 November snow and hail influenced the ship's council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction, expecting to arrive one day at the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>.

On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman reached and sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of <a href="Macquarie%20Harbour">Macquarie Harbour</a>. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after <a href="Antonio%20van%20Diemen">Antonio van Diemen</a>, <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies</a>. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east. Tasman then tried to work his two ships into <a href="Adventure%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Adventure Bay</a> on the east coast of <a href="South%20Bruny%20Island">South Bruny Island</a> where he was blown out to sea by a storm. This area he named <a href="Storm%20Bay">Storm Bay</a>. Two days later Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the <a href="Forestier%20Peninsula">Forestier Peninsula</a>. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay – in the larger <a href="Marion%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Marion Bay</a>. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay. However, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.

After some exploration, Tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east. Tasman endured a very rough journey from Tasmania to New Zealand. In one of his diary entries Tasman credits his compass, claiming it was the only thing that kept him alive. On 13 December they sighted land on the north-west coast of the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to do so. Tasman named it "Staten Landt" on the assumption that it was connected to an island (<a href="Staten%20Island%2C%20Argentina">Staten Island, Argentina</a>) at the south of the tip of South America. He sailed north, then east and five days later anchored about 7 km from the coast. He sent ship's boats to gather water, but one of his boats was attacked by <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> in a double hulled <a href="waka%20%28canoe%29">waka</a> (canoe) and four of his men were attacked and killed by <a href="Mere%20%28weapon%29">mere</a>.

As Tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore, of which "eleven swarming with people came off towards us." The waka approached the "Zeehaen" which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag. <a href="Canister%20shot">Canister shot</a> also hit the side of a waka.

Archeological research has shown the Dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area, which the Māori may have been trying to protect. Tasman named the bay "Murderers' Bay" (now known as <a href="Golden%20Bay">Golden Bay</a>) and sailed north, but mistook <a href="Cook%20Strait">Cook Strait</a> for a <a href="bight%20%28geography%29">bight</a> (naming it "<a href="Zeehaen%27s%20Bight">Zeehaen's Bight</a>"). Two names he gave to New Zealand landmarks still endure, <a href="Cape%20Maria%20van%20Diemen">Cape Maria van Diemen</a> and <a href="Three%20Kings%20Islands">Three Kings Islands</a>, but "Kaap Pieter Boreels" was renamed by Cook 125 years later to <a href="Cape%20Egmont">Cape Egmont</a>.

En route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>n archipelago on 20 January 1643. While passing the <a href="Fiji">Fiji Islands</a> Tasman's ships came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of <a href="Vanua%20Levu">Vanua Levu</a> and <a href="Cikobia">Cikobia</a> before making his way back into the open sea. He eventually turned north-west to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and arrived at Batavia on 15 June 1643.

Tasman left <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> on January 30, 1644 on his second voyage with three ships ("Limmen", "Zeemeeuw" and the tender "Braek"). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of <a href="New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29">New Holland</a>. However, he missed the <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a> between New Guinea and Australia, probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes, and continued his voyage by following the shore of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on <a href="New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29">New Holland</a>, and its people. He arrived back in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> in August 1644.

From the point of view of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route. Although received modestly, the company was upset to a degree that Tasman didn't fully explore the lands he found, and decided that a more "persistent explorer" should be chosen for any future expeditions. For over a century, until the era of <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>, Tasmania and New Zealand were not visited by Europeans – mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident.

On 2 November 1644 Abel Tasman was appointed a member of the Council of Justice at Batavia. He went to Sumatra in 1646, and in August 1647 to Siam (now <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>) with letters from the company to the King. In May 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to <a href="Manila">Manila</a> to try to intercept and loot the Spanish silver ships coming from America, but he had no success and returned to Batavia in January 1649. In November 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial, was suspended from his office of commander, fined, and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor. On 5 January 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at Batavia. He was in good circumstances, being one of the larger landowners in the town. He died at Batavia on 10 October 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife. His property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage. In his testimony (dating from 1657) he left only 25 guilders to the poor of his village Lutjegast.

Although Tasman's pilot, Frans Visscher, published "Memoir concerning the discovery of the South land" in 1642, Tasman's detailed journal was not published until 1898; however, some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers.

Multiple places have been named after Tasman, including:

His portrait has been on 4 New Zealand postage stamp issues, on a 1992 5 <a href="NZD">NZD</a> coin, and on one 1985 Australian postage stamp

The original <a href="http%3A//library.sl.nsw.gov.au/record%3Db2058092%7ES2">Tasman Map</a> is held in the collection of the <a href="State%20Library%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">State Library of New South Wales</a>. The map is also known as the Bonaparte map, as it was once owned by <a href="Roland%20Bonaparte">Prince Roland Bonaparte</a>, the great-nephew of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. The map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during Tasman’s first and second voyages. As none of the journals or logs composed during Tasman’s second voyage have survived, the Bonaparte map remains as an important contemporary artefact of Tasman’s voyage to the northern coast of the Australian continent.

The Tasman map largely reveals the extent of understanding the Dutch had of the Australian continent at the time. The map includes the western and southern coasts of Australia, accidentally encountered by Dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">VOC</a> headquarters in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a>. In addition, the map shows the tracks of Tasman’s two voyages . Of his second voyage, the map shows the area of the <a href="Banda%20Islands">Banda Islands</a>, the southern coast of <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and much of the northern coast of Australia. However, the area of the Torres Strait is shown unexamined; this is despite having been given orders by VOC Council at Batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between New Guinea and the Australian continent.

There is debate as to the origin of the map. It is widely believed that the map was produced in Batavia, however, it has also been argued that the map was produced in Amsterdam. The authorship of the map has also been debated, while the map is commonly attributed to Tasman, it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration, probably involving Franchoijs Visscher and Isaack Gilseman, who took part in both of Tasman’s voyages. Whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate, as a VOC company report in December 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing Tasman’s voyages were yet complete.

In 1943, <a href="http%3A//www.sl.nsw.gov.au/collection-items/tasman-map-mitchell-vestibule">a mosaic version of the map</a>, composed of coloured marble and brass, was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the <a href="http%3A//www.sl.nsw.gov.au/">Mitchell Library</a>.

Algebraic geometry

Algebraic geometry is a branch of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, classically studying <a href="zero%20of%20a%20function">zeros</a> of <a href="multivariate%20polynomial">multivariate polynomial</a>s. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>, for solving <a href="geometry">geometrical problems</a> about these sets of zeros.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are <a href="algebraic%20variety">algebraic varieties</a>, which are geometric manifestations of <a href="solution%20set">solutions</a> of <a href="systems%20of%20polynomial%20equations">systems of polynomial equations</a>. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: <a href="plane%20algebraic%20curve">plane algebraic curve</a>s, which include <a href="line%20%28geometry%29">lines</a>, <a href="circle">circle</a>s, <a href="parabola">parabola</a>s, <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>s, <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a>s, <a href="cubic%20curve">cubic curve</a>s like <a href="elliptic%20curve">elliptic curve</a>s and quartic curves like <a href="lemniscate%20of%20Bernoulli">lemniscate</a>s, and <a href="Cassini%20oval">Cassini oval</a>s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the <a href="singular%20point%20of%20a%20curve">singular point</a>s, the <a href="inflection%20point">inflection point</a>s and the <a href="point%20at%20infinity">points at infinity</a>. More advanced questions involve the <a href="topology">topology</a> of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>, <a href="topology">topology</a> and <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. Initially a study of <a href="systems%20of%20polynomial%20equations">systems of polynomial equations</a> in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where <a href="equation%20solving">equation solving</a> leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
In the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.

Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in <a href="topology">topology</a>, <a href="differential%20geometry">differential</a> and <a href="complex%20geometry">complex geometry</a>. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is <a href="Grothendieck">Grothendieck</a>'s <a href="scheme%20theory">scheme theory</a> which allows one to use <a href="sheaf%20theory">sheaf theory</a> to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of <a href="differential%20manifold">differential</a> and <a href="complex%20manifold">analytic manifolds</a>. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through <a href="Hilbert%27s%20Nullstellensatz">Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>, with a <a href="maximal%20ideal">maximal ideal</a> of the <a href="coordinate%20ring">coordinate ring</a>, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. <a href="Wiles%27s%20proof%20of%20Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Wiles's proof</a> of the longstanding conjecture called <a href="Fermat%27s%20last%20theorem">Fermat's last theorem</a> is an example of the power of this approach.

In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more <a href="systems%20of%20polynomial%20equations">polynomial equations</a>. For instance, the <a href="N-sphere">two-dimensional</a> <a href="sphere">sphere</a> in three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a> R could be defined as the set of all points ("x","y","z") with

A "slanted" circle in R can be defined as the set of all points ("x","y","z") which satisfy the two polynomial equations

First we start with a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> "k". In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers C, but many of the same results are true if we assume only that "k" is <a href="algebraically%20closed%20field">algebraically closed</a>. We consider the <a href="affine%20space">affine space</a> of dimension "n" over "k", denoted A("k") (or more simply A, when "k" is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinates system, one may identify A("k") with "k". The purpose of not working with "k" is to emphasize that one "forgets" the vector space structure that "k" carries.

A function "f" : A → A is said to be "polynomial" (or "regular") if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial "p" in "k"["x"...,"x"] such that "f"("M") = "p"("t"...,"t") for every point "M" with coordinates ("t"...,"t") in A. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in A.

When a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine "n"-space may be identified with the ring of <a href="polynomial%20function">polynomial function</a>s in "n" variables over "k". Therefore, the set of the regular functions on A is a ring, which is denoted "k"[A].

We say that a polynomial "vanishes" at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let "S" be a set of polynomials in "k"[A]. The "vanishing set of S" (or "vanishing locus" or "zero set") is the set "V"("S") of all points in A where every polynomial in "S" vanishes. Symbolically,

A subset of A which is "V"("S"), for some "S", is called an "algebraic set". The "V" stands for "variety" (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset "U" of A, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If "U" is "any" subset of A, define "I"("U") to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains "U". The "I" stands for <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a>: if two polynomials "f" and "g" both vanish on "U", then "f"+"g" vanishes on "U", and if "h" is any polynomial, then "hf" vanishes on "U", so "I"("U") is always an ideal of the polynomial ring "k"[A].

Two natural questions to ask are:

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the <a href="Zariski%20topology">Zariski topology</a>, a topology on A whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of "k"[A]. Then "U" = "V"("I"("U")) if and only if "U" is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by <a href="Hilbert%27s%20Nullstellensatz">Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>. In one of its forms, it says that "I"("V"("S")) is the <a href="radical%20of%20an%20ideal">radical</a> of the ideal generated by "S". In more abstract language, there is a <a href="Galois%20connection">Galois connection</a>, giving rise to two <a href="closure%20operator">closure operator</a>s; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the <a href="Galois%20connection%23Examples">example</a> is elaborated at Galois connection.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set "U". <a href="Hilbert%27s%20basis%20theorem">Hilbert's basis theorem</a> implies that ideals in "k"[A] are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called "<a href="irreducible%20component">irreducible</a>" if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the "irreducible components" of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a "<a href="algebraic%20variety">variety</a>". It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a <a href="prime%20ideal">prime ideal</a> of the polynomial ring.

Some authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use "irreducible variety" to make the distinction when needed.

Just as <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a>s are the natural maps on <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a>s and <a href="smooth%20function">smooth function</a>s are the natural maps on <a href="differentiable%20manifold">differentiable manifold</a>s, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called "regular functions" or "polynomial functions". A regular function on an algebraic set "V" contained in A is the restriction to "V" of a regular function on A. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even <a href="analytic%20function">analytic</a>.

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a <a href="normal%20space">normal</a> <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a>, where the <a href="Tietze%20extension%20theorem">Tietze extension theorem</a> guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on "V" form a ring, which we denote by "k"["V"]. This ring is called the "<a href="coordinate%20ring">coordinate ring</a> of V".

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on A, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on "V" is the restriction of two functions "f" and "g" in "k"[A], then "f" − "g" is a polynomial function which is null on "V" and thus belongs to "I"("V"). Thus "k"["V"] may be identified with "k"[A]/"I"("V").

Using regular functions from an affine variety to A, we can define <a href="morphism%20of%20algebraic%20varieties">regular map</a>s from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let "V" be a variety contained in A. Choose "m" regular functions on "V", and call them "f", ..., "f". We define a "regular map" "f" from "V" to A by letting . In other words, each "f" determines one coordinate of the <a href="image%20%28mathematics%29">range</a> of "f".

If "V"′ is a variety contained in A, we say that "f" is a "regular map" from "V" to "V"′ if the range of "f" is contained in "V"′.

The definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.
The regular maps are also called "morphisms", as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a <a href="category%20theory">category</a>, where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the <a href="morphism">morphism</a>s are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.

Given a regular map "g" from "V" to "V"′ and a regular function "f" of "k"["V"′], then . The map is a <a href="ring%20homomorphism">ring homomorphism</a> from "k"["V"′] to "k"["V"]. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from "k"["V"′] to "k"["V"] defines a regular map from "V" to "V"′. This defines an <a href="equivalence%20of%20categories">equivalence of categories</a> between the category of algebraic sets and the <a href="dual%20%28category%20theory%29">opposite category</a> of the finitely generated <a href="reduced%20ring">reduced</a> "k"-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of <a href="scheme%20theory">scheme theory</a>.

Contrarily to the preceding ones, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.

If "V" is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an <a href="integral%20domain">integral domain</a> and has thus a <a href="field%20of%20fractions">field of fractions</a> which is denoted "k"("V") and called the "field of the rational functions" on "V" or, shortly, the "<a href="function%20field%20of%20an%20algebraic%20variety">function field</a>" of "V". Its elements are the restrictions to "V" of the <a href="rational%20function">rational function</a>s over the affine space containing "V". The <a href="domain%20of%20a%20function">domain</a> of a rational function "f" is not "V" but the <a href="complement%20%28set%20theory%29">complement</a> of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of "f" vanishes.

Like for regular maps, one may define a "rational map" from a variety "V" to a variety "V"<nowiki>'</nowiki>. Like for the regular maps, the rational maps from "V" to "V"<nowiki>'</nowiki> may be identified to the <a href="ring%20homomorphism">field homomorphism</a>s from "k"("V"<nowiki>'</nowiki>) to "k"("V").

Two affine varieties are "birationally equivalent" if there are two rational functions between them which are <a href="function%20inverse">inverse</a> one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.

An affine variety is a "<a href="rational%20variety">rational variety</a>" if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a rational parameterization. For example, the circle of equation formula_5 is a rational curve, as it has the parameterization
which may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.

The problem of <a href="resolution%20of%20singularities">resolution of singularities</a> is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also <a href="smooth%20completion">smooth completion</a>). It has been positively solved in characteristic 0 by <a href="Heisuke%20Hironaka">Heisuke Hironaka</a> in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.

Just as the formulas for the roots of 2nd, 3rd and 4th degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number "i", a root of the polynomial , projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points "at infinity", points where parallel lines may meet.

To see how this might come about, consider the variety . If we draw it, we get a <a href="parabola">parabola</a>. As "x" goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point ("x", "x") also goes to positive infinity. As "x" goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.

Compare this to the variety "V"("y" − "x"). This is a <a href="cubic%20curve">cubic curve</a>. As "x" goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point ("x", "x") goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as "x" goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior "at infinity" of "V"("y" − "x") is different from the behavior "at infinity" of "V"("y" − "x").

The consideration of the "projective completion" of the two curves, which is their prolongation "at infinity" in the <a href="projective%20plane">projective plane</a>, allows to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a <a href="regular%20point%20of%20an%20algebraic%20variety">regular point</a>, whose tangent is the <a href="line%20at%20infinity">line at infinity</a>, while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a <a href="cusp%20%28singularity%29">cusp</a>. Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by "x", and <a href="Riemann-Roch%20theorem%20for%20algebraic%20curves">Riemann-Roch theorem</a> implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.

Thus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior "at infinity" and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20theorem">Bézout's theorem</a> on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

Nowadays, the "<a href="projective%20space">projective space</a>" P of dimension "n" is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension , or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension . When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension , all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of "k". This defines the <a href="homogeneous%20coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a> of a point of P as a sequence of elements of the base field "k", defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of "k" (the same for the whole sequence).

Given a polynomial in variables, it vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is <a href="Homogeneous%20polynomial">homogeneous</a>. In this case, one says that the polynomial "vanishes" at the corresponding point of P. This allows to define a "projective algebraic set" in P as the set , where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced <a href="homogeneous%20ideal">homogeneous ideal</a>s which define them. The "projective varieties" are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose <a href="homogeneous%20coordinate%20ring">homogeneous coordinate ring</a> is an <a href="integral%20domain">integral domain</a>, the "projective coordinates ring" being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.

The only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the "field of the rational functions" or "function field " is a useful notion, which, similarly as in the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.

Real algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of algebraic geometry.

The fact that the field of the real numbers is an <a href="ordered%20field">ordered field</a> cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation formula_8 is a circle if formula_9, but does not have any real point if formula_10. It follows that real algebraic geometry is not only the study of the real algebraic varieties, but has been generalized to the study of the "semi-algebraic sets", which are the solutions of systems of polynomial equations and polynomial inequalities. For example, a branch of the <a href="hyperbola">hyperbola</a> of equation formula_11 is not an algebraic variety, but is a semi-algebraic set defined by formula_12 and formula_13 or by formula_12 and formula_15.

One of the challenging problems of real algebraic geometry is the unsolved <a href="Hilbert%27s%20sixteenth%20problem">Hilbert's sixteenth problem</a>: Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular plane curve of degree 8.

One may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM'79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, France in June 1979. At this meeting,

Since then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is simply exponential in the number of the variables

A body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called <a href="numerical%20algebraic%20geometry">numerical algebraic geometry</a> has been developed over the last several decades. The main computational method is <a href="homotopy%20continuation">homotopy continuation</a>. This supports, for example, a model of <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.

A <a href="Gr%C3%B6bner%20basis">Gröbner basis</a> is a system of <a href="Ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29%23Ideal%20generated%20by%20a%20set">generators</a> of a polynomial <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.

Given an ideal "I" defining an algebraic set "V":

Gröbner basis computations do not allow to compute directly the primary decomposition of "I" nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of "V", but most algorithms for this involve Gröbner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gröbner bases use <a href="regular%20chain">regular chain</a>s but may need Gröbner bases in some exceptional situations.

Gröbner base are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. <a href="Faug%C3%A8re%27s%20F4%20and%20F5%20algorithms">Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms</a> realize this complexity, as F5 algorithm may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.

CAD is an algorithm which had been introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the <a href="Tarski%E2%80%93Seidenberg%20theorem">Tarski–Seidenberg theorem</a> on <a href="quantifier%20elimination">quantifier elimination</a> over the real numbers.

This theorem concerns the formulas of the <a href="first-order%20logic">first-order logic</a> whose <a href="atomic%20formula">atomic formula</a>s are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators "and" (∧), "or" (∨), "not" (¬), "for all" (∀) and "exists" (∃). Tarski's theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifier (∀, ∃).

The complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula, that is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.

While Gröbner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless if most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.

Since 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improve CAD or to find alternate algorithms in special cases of general interest.

As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.

The basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a double exponential worst case <a href="Computational%20complexity%20theory">complexity</a>. More precisely, if "d" is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and "n" the number of variables, their complexity is at most formula_16 for some constant "c", and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least formula_17 for another constant "c"′.

During the last 20 years of 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity formula_18.

Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by Gröbner bases, one may cite "testing if an affine variety is empty" and "solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions." Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries <a href="Faug%C3%A8re%27s%20F4%20and%20F5%20algorithms">Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms</a> have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity ("probably" because the evaluation of the complexity of Gröbner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).

The main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite "counting the number of connected components", "testing if two points are in the same components" or "computing a <a href="Whitney%20stratification">Whitney stratification</a> of a real algebraic set". They have a complexity of
formula_18, but the constant involved by "O" notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and this is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.

The modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, <a href="formal%20scheme">formal scheme</a>s, <a href="ind-scheme">ind-scheme</a>s, <a href="algebraic%20space">algebraic space</a>s, <a href="algebraic%20stack">algebraic stack</a>s and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.

Most remarkably, in late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into <a href="Alexander%20Grothendieck">Alexander Grothendieck</a>'s concept of a <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">scheme</a>. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field "k", and the category of finitely generated reduced "k"-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a <a href="Grothendieck%20topology">Grothendieck topology</a>. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the <a href="%C3%A9tale%20topology">étale topology</a>, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including <a href="Nisnevich%20topology">Nisnevich topology</a>. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, <a href="Deligne-Mumford%20stack">Deligne-Mumford stack</a>s, both often called algebraic stacks.

Sometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, <a href="Nikolai%20Durov">Nikolai Durov</a> has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a <a href="tropical%20geometry">tropical geometry</a>, of an <a href="absolute%20geometry">absolute geometry</a> over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of <a href="Arakelov%27s%20geometry">Arakelov's geometry</a> were realized in this setup.

Another formal generalization is possible to <a href="universal%20algebraic%20geometry">universal algebraic geometry</a> in which every <a href="Variety%20%28universal%20algebra%29">variety of algebras</a> has its own algebraic geometry. The term "variety of algebras" should not be confused with "algebraic variety".

The language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.

Algebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the <a href="Grothendieck%20site">Grothendieck site</a> of affine schemes to a <a href="higher%20category%20theory">higher categorical</a> site of <a href="derived%20affine%20scheme">derived affine scheme</a>s, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of <a href="differential%20graded%20commutative%20algebra">differential graded commutative algebra</a>s, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). <a href="Quillen%20model%20category">Quillen model categories</a>, Segal categories and <a href="quasicategory">quasicategories</a> are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the "<a href="derived%20algebraic%20geometry">derived algebraic geometry</a>", introduced by the school of <a href="Carlos%20Simpson">Carlos Simpson</a>, including Andre Hirschowitz, <a href="Bertrand%20To%C3%ABn">Bertrand Toën</a>, Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by <a href="Jacob%20Lurie">Jacob Lurie</a>, <a href="Bertrand%20To%C3%ABn">Bertrand Toën</a>, and <a href="Gabrielle%20Vezzosi">Gabrielle Vezzosi</a>. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990s by <a href="Maxim%20Kontsevich">Maxim Kontsevich</a> and followers.

Some of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the <a href="Hellenistic%20Greece">Hellenistic Greeks</a> from the 5th century BC. The <a href="Delian%20problem">Delian problem</a>, for instance, was to construct a length "x" so that the cube of side "x" contained the same volume as the rectangular box "a""b" for given sides "a" and "b". <a href="Menaechmus">Menaechmus</a> (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics "ay" = "x" and "xy" = "ab". The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> and <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius</a> studied more systematically problems on <a href="conic%20sections">conic sections</a>, and also involved the use of coordinates. The <a href="Mathematics%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Arab mathematicians</a> were able to solve by purely algebraic means certain cubic equations, and then to interpret the results geometrically. This was done, for instance, by <a href="Ibn%20al-Haytham">Ibn al-Haytham</a> in the 10th century AD. Subsequently, <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> mathematician <a href="Omar%20Khayy%C3%A1m">Omar Khayyám</a> (born 1048 A.D.) discovered the general method of solving <a href="cubic%20equation">cubic equation</a>s by intersecting a parabola with a circle. Each of these early developments in algebraic geometry dealt with questions of finding and describing the intersections of algebraic curves.

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> mathematicians such as <a href="Gerolamo%20Cardano">Gerolamo Cardano</a> and <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Fontana%20Tartaglia">Niccolò Fontana "Tartaglia"</a> on their studies of the cubic equation. The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry. The French mathematicians <a href="Franciscus%20Vieta">Franciscus Vieta</a> and later <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> and <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a> revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of <a href="coordinate%20geometry">coordinate geometry</a>. They were interested primarily in the properties of "algebraic curves", such as those defined by <a href="Diophantine%20equations">Diophantine equations</a> (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).

During the same period, Blaise Pascal and <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Desargues">Gérard Desargues</a> approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the <a href="synthetic%20geometry">synthetic</a> notions of <a href="projective%20geometry">projective geometry</a>. Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek "ruler and compass construction". Ultimately, the <a href="analytic%20geometry">analytic geometry</a> of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a> and <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a>. However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the "calculus of infinitesimals" of <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Lagrange">Lagrange</a> and <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Euler</a>.

It took the simultaneous 19th century developments of <a href="non-Euclidean%20geometry">non-Euclidean geometry</a> and <a href="Abelian%20integral">Abelian integral</a>s in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by <a href="Edmond%20Laguerre">Edmond Laguerre</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a>, who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of "homogeneous polynomial forms", and more specifically <a href="quadratic%20form">quadratic form</a>s, on projective space. Subsequently, <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a> studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of <a href="transformation%20group">transformations</a> on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental <a href="Kleinian%20geometry">Kleinian geometry</a> on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree <a href="birational%20transformation">birational transformation</a>s. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century <a href="Italian%20school%20of%20algebraic%20geometry">Italian school of algebraic geometry</a> to classify <a href="algebraic%20surface">algebraic surface</a>s up to <a href="birational%20isomorphism">birational isomorphism</a>.

The second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead <a href="Bernhard%20Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a> to the development of <a href="Riemann%20surface">Riemann surface</a>s.

In the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>. The prominent results in this direction are <a href="Hilbert%27s%20basis%20theorem">Hilbert's basis theorem</a> and <a href="Hilbert%27s%20Nullstellensatz">Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a>, which are the basis of the connexion between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and <a href="Francis%20Sowerby%20Macaulay">Macaulay</a>'s <a href="multivariate%20resultant">multivariate resultant</a>, which is the basis of <a href="elimination%20theory">elimination theory</a>. Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by <a href="singularity%20theory">singularity theory</a> and computational algebraic geometry.

<a href="B.%20L.%20van%20der%20Waerden">B. L. van der Waerden</a>, <a href="Oscar%20Zariski">Oscar Zariski</a> and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Weil">André Weil</a> developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>, including <a href="valuation%20theory">valuation theory</a> and the theory of <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a>. One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of <a href="Italian%20school%20of%20algebraic%20geometry">Italian school of algebraic geometry</a>. In particular, this school used systematically the notion of <a href="generic%20point">generic point</a> without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.

In the 1950s and 1960s <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Grothendieck">Alexander Grothendieck</a> recast the foundations making use of <a href="sheaf%20theory">sheaf theory</a>. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of <a href="scheme%20%28mathematics%29">schemes</a> was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of <a href="homological%20algebra">homological techniques</a>. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, <a href="singularity%20theory">singularities</a> and <a href="moduli%20space">moduli</a>.

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the <a href="abelian%20variety">abelian varieties</a>, which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a>. The prototypical examples are the <a href="elliptic%20curve">elliptic curve</a>s, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of <a href="Fermat%27s%20last%20theorem">Fermat's last theorem</a> and are also used in <a href="elliptic%20curve%20cryptography">elliptic curve cryptography</a>.

In parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of <a href="Gr%C3%B6bner%20basis">Gröbner bases</a>, introduced by <a href="Bruno%20Buchberger">Bruno Buchberger</a> in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the <a href="cylindrical%20algebraic%20decomposition">cylindrical algebraic decomposition</a>, introduced by <a href="George%20E.%20Collins">George E. Collins</a> in 1973.

See also: <a href="derived%20algebraic%20geometry">derived algebraic geometry</a>.

An <a href="analytic%20variety">analytic variety</a> is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving <a href="analytic%20function">analytic function</a>s. It is analogous to the included concept of real or complex <a href="algebraic%20variety">algebraic variety</a>. Any <a href="complex%20manifold">complex manifold</a> is an analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have <a href="Mathematical%20singularity">singular points</a>, not all analytic varieties are manifolds.

Modern analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to real and complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Serre">Jean-Pierre Serre</a> in his paper "<a href="GAGA">GAGA</a>", the name of which is French for "Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry". Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite <a href="Characteristic%20%28algebra%29">characteristic</a>.

Algebraic geometry now finds applications in <a href="algebraic%20statistics">statistics</a>, <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a>, <a href="robotics">robotics</a>, <a href="algebraic%20geometric%20code">error-correcting codes</a>, <a href="computational%20phylogenetics">phylogenetics</a> and <a href="geometric%20modelling">geometric modelling</a>. There are also connections to <a href="Homological%20mirror%20symmetry">string theory</a>, <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>, <a href="Matching%20%28graph%20theory%29">graph matching</a>s, <a href="soliton">soliton</a>s and <a href="integer%20programming">integer programming</a>.

Austin, Texas

Austin (, ) is the <a href="Capital%20city">capital</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and the seat of <a href="Travis%20County%2C%20Texas">Travis County</a>, with portions extending into <a href="Hays%20County%2C%20Texas">Hays</a> and <a href="Williamson%20County%2C%20Texas">Williamson</a> counties. It is the city in the United States and the city in Texas. It is the fastest growing large city in the United States and the <a href="List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States">second most populous state capital</a> in the U.S after <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2016 estimate, Austin has a population of 947,890. Located in in the foothills of <a href="Texas%20Hill%20Country">Texas Hill Country</a>, the city is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways including <a href="Lady%20Bird%20Lake">Lady Bird Lake</a>, <a href="Barton%20Springs%20Pool">Barton Springs</a>, <a href="McKinney%20Falls%20State%20Park">McKinney Falls</a>, the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a>, <a href="Lake%20Travis">Lake Travis</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Walter%20E.%20Long">Lake Walter E. Long</a>. It is the cultural and economic center of the metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 2,056,405 as of July 1, 2016. It is the <a href="List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States">most populous state capital</a> in the U.S that isn't the most populous city in a <a href="state">state</a>.

In the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a>. In 1839, the site was officially chosen to replace <a href="Houston">Houston</a> as the new capital of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and was incorporated under the name Waterloo. Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to Austin in honor of <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, the "Father of Texas" and the republic's first secretary of state. The city subsequently grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">Texas State Capitol</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>. After a lull in growth from the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Austin resumed its development into a major city and, by the 1980s, it emerged as a center for technology and business. A number of <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a> companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>, <a href="Cisco">Cisco</a>, <a href="eBay">eBay</a>, <a href="Google">Google</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="Oracle%20Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>, <a href="Paypal">Paypal</a>, <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a>, <a href="3M">3M</a>, and <a href="Whole%20Foods%20Market">Whole Foods Market</a>. <a href="Dell">Dell</a>'s worldwide <a href="headquarters">headquarters</a> is located in nearby <a href="Round%20Rock%2C%20Texas">Round Rock</a>, a <a href="suburb">suburb</a> of Austin.

Residents of Austin are known as <a href="List%20of%20people%20from%20Austin%2C%20Texas">Austinites</a>. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, <a href="blue-collar">blue-collar</a> workers, and a vibrant LGBT community. The city's official slogan promotes Austin as "The Live Music Capital of the World," a reference to the many musicians and live music venues within the city, as well as the long-running <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> TV concert series "<a href="Austin%20City%20Limits">Austin City Limits</a>". The city also adopted "<a href="Silicon%20Hills">Silicon Hills</a>" as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have also adopted the unofficial slogan "<a href="Keep%20Austin%20Weird">Keep Austin Weird</a>," which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. In the late 19th century, Austin was known as the "<a href="City%20of%20the%20Violet%20Crown">City of the Violet Crown</a>" because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset. Even today, many Austin businesses use the term "Violet Crown" in their name. Austin is known as a "clean-air city" for its stringent no-smoking ordinances that apply to all public places and buildings, including restaurants and bars. The FBI ranked Austin as the second-safest major city in the U.S. for the year 2012. "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" named Austin the best place to live in the U.S. in 2017.

Austin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area's earliest known inhabitants lived during the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (Ice Age) and are linked to the <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis culture</a> around 9200 BC (11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied <a href="Gault%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Gault Site</a>, midway between <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Texas">Georgetown</a> and <a href="Fort%20Hood">Fort Hood</a>.

When settlers arrived from Europe, the <a href="Tonkawa">Tonkawa</a> tribe inhabited the area. The <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a>s and <a href="Lipan%20Apache%20people">Lipan Apaches</a> were also known to travel through the area. Spanish colonists, including the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition, traveled through the area for centuries, though few permanent settlements were created for some time. In 1730, three missions from East Texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the Colorado River, in what is now <a href="Zilker%20Park">Zilker Park</a>, in Austin. The mission was in this area for only about seven months, and then was moved to San Antonio de Béxar and split into three missions.

Early in the 19th century, Spanish forts were established in what are now <a href="Bastrop%2C%20Texas">Bastrop</a> and <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20Texas">San Marcos</a>. Following Mexico's independence, new settlements were established in Central Texas, but growth in the region was stagnant because of conflicts with the regional Native Americans.

In 1835–1836, Texans fought and won <a href="Texas%20Revolution">independence from Mexico</a>. Texas thus became an independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. After Vice President <a href="Mirabeau%20B.%20Lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a> visited the area during a <a href="American%20bison">buffalo</a>-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital, then in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a> near the present-day <a href="Congress%20Avenue%20Bridge">Congress Avenue Bridge</a>. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>. <a href="Mirabeau%20B.%20Lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>, second president of the newly formed Republic of Texas, advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo, noting the area's hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings. Waterloo was selected and the name "Austin" was chosen as the town's new name. The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe</a> and <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a>, as well as routes between northern Mexico and the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red River</a>.
<a href="Edwin%20Waller">Edwin Waller</a> was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital. The original site was narrowed to that fronted the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a> between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held. The grid plan Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the Texas Rangers and the Comanches, known as the <a href="Council%20House%20Fight">Council House Fight</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Plum%20Creek">Battle of Plum Creek</a>, finally pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas. Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.

Initially, the new capital thrived. But Lamar's political enemy, <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, used two Mexican army incursions to <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar's decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, of whom nearly half fled from Austin when Congress recessed. The resident Black population listed in January of this same year was 176. The fear of Austin's proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the Archive War, but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a>. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, Anson Jones, and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.
In 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were slaves. In 1861, with the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession. However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by Union forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas by <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> General <a href="Gordon%20Granger">Gordon Granger</a> at Galveston in an event commemorated as <a href="Juneteenth">Juneteenth</a>. Black communities such as Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established with Clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former <a href="African-American">African-American</a> <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> ‒ west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. In 1870, blacks made up 36.5% of Austin's population. The postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth. The opening of the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&TC) in 1871 turned Austin into the major trading center for the region with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle. The Missouri, Kansas, and Texas (MKT) line followed close behind. Austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the <a href="Chisholm%20Trail">Chisholm Trail</a> and "drovers" pushed cattle north to the railroad. Cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export and a cotton gin engine was located downtown near the trains for "ginning" cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment. However, as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s, Austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities. In addition, the areas east of Austin took over cattle and cotton production from Austin, especially in towns like Hutto and Taylor that sit over the blackland prairie, with its deep, rich soils for producing cotton and hay.

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of <a href="Huston-Tillotson%20University">Huston-Tillotson University</a>) opened its doors. The <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state Capitol for four years before.

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">state capitol building</a> was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world. In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new "<a href="Moonlight%20tower">moon towers</a>". Unfortunately, the first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Austin launched a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the <a href="Lower%20Colorado%20River%20Authority">Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)</a> that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part because the <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a> provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.
During the early twentieth century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period—such as the construction of new roads, schools, and hospitals—were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation. Deed restrictions also played an important role in residential segregation. After 1935 most housing deeds prohibited African Americans (and sometimes other nonwhite groups) from using land. Combined with the system of segregated public services, racial segregation increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization.

In 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam that formed Lake McDonald (now called Lake Austin) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form the flood-control lake, Lake Travis. In the early 20th century, the <a href="Texas%20Oil%20Boom">Texas Oil Boom</a> took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.

After the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas' major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> reported Austin's population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software. The <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> emerged as a major university.

The 1970s saw Austin's emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href="Asleep%20at%20the%20Wheel">Asleep at the Wheel</a>, and <a href="Stevie%20Ray%20Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a> and iconic music venues such as the <a href="Armadillo%20World%20Headquarters">Armadillo World Headquarters</a>. Over time, the long-running television program "Austin City Limits", its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> music festival solidified the city's place in the music industry.

The most southerly of the capitals of the contiguous forty-eight states, Austin is located in <a href="Central%20Texas">Central Texas</a>, along the <a href="Balcones%20Escarpment">Balcones Escarpment</a> and <a href="Interstate%2035">Interstate 35</a>, northwest of <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. It is also south of <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> and north of <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>. Its elevation varies from to approximately above sea level. In 2010, the city occupied a total area of . Approximately of this area is water.

Austin is situated on the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a>, with three man-made (artificial) lakes within the city limits: Lady Bird Lake (formerly known as Town Lake), <a href="Lake%20Austin">Lake Austin</a> (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and <a href="Lake%20Walter%20E.%20Long">Lake Walter E. Long</a> that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant. <a href="Mansfield%20Dam">Mansfield Dam</a> and the foot of Lake Travis are located within the city's limits. Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are each on the Colorado River. As a result of its straddling the <a href="Balcones%20Fault">Balcones Fault</a>, much of the eastern part of the city is flat, with heavy clay and loam soils, whereas, the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the <a href="Texas%20Hill%20Country">Texas Hill Country</a>. Because the hills to the west are primarily <a href="limestone">limestone</a> rock with a thin covering of topsoil, portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms. To help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power, the <a href="Lower%20Colorado%20River%20Authority">Lower Colorado River Authority</a> operates a series of dams that form the <a href="Texas%20Highland%20Lakes">Texas Highland Lakes</a>. The lakes also provide venues for boating, swimming, and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores.

Austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions, and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert, the tropics, and a wetter climate. The area is very diverse ecologically and biologically, and is home to a variety of animals and plants. Notably, the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring, including the popular bluebonnets, some planted in an effort by <a href="Lady%20Bird%20Johnson">"Lady Bird" Johnson</a>, wife of <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">former President Lyndon Johnson</a>.

A popular point of prominence in Austin is <a href="Mount%20Bonnell">Mount Bonnell</a>. At about above sea level, it is a natural limestone formation overlooking Lake Austin on the Colorado River, with an observation deck about below its summit.

The soils of Austin range from shallow, gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, silty clay loams, silty clays or clays in the city's eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin's soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>.

Austin has several rock climbing locations. Rock climbing can be found at three Austin parks: Barton Creek Greenbelt, Bull Creek Park and McKinney Falls State Park. The sport-climbing routes at Barton Creek Greenbelt–with its many vertical to overhanging walls–offer challenges to both the beginner and advanced climber.

Austin's skyline historically was modest, dominated by the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas <a href="Main%20Building%20%28University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin%29">Main Building</a>. However, many new high-rise towers have been constructed since 2000—Austin's ten tallest buildings were completed after 2003. The city's tallest building, <a href="The%20Austonian">The Austonian</a>, was topped out on September 17, 2009. Austin is currently undergoing a skyscraper boom, which includes recent construction on the now complete 360 Condominiums at , Spring (condominiums), the Austonian at , and several other office, hotel and residential buildings. Downtown's buildings are somewhat spread out, partly due to a restriction that preserves the view of the <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">Texas State Capitol</a> from various locations around Austin (known as the Capitol View Corridors).

At night, parts of Austin are lit by "artificial moonlight" from <a href="moonlight%20tower">Moonlight Towers</a> built to illuminate the central part of the city. The moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks. Only 15 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in Austin, and none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed. The towers are featured in the 1993 film "<a href="Dazed%20and%20Confused%20%28film%29">Dazed and Confused</a>".

The central business district of Austin is home to the tallest condo towers in the state, with the under construction Independent (58 stories and . tall) and <a href="The%20Austonian">The Austonian</a> (topping out at 56 floors and . tall). The Independent will supplant The Austonian as the tallest all-residential building in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River when completed in 2018.

In 2005, then-Mayor Will Wynn set out a goal of having 25,000 people living Downtown by 2015. Although Downtown's growth did not meet this goal, Downtown's residential population did surge from an estimated 5,000 in 2005 to 12,000 in 2015. The skyline has drastically changed in recent years, and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong. As of December 2016, there are 31 high-rise projects either under construction, approved or planned to be completed in Austin's downtown core between 2017 and 2020. Sixteen of those are set to rise above . tall, including four above 600', and eight above 500'. An additional 15 towers are slated to stand between 300' and 399' tall.

Downtown growth has been aided by the presence of a popular live music and nightlife scene, museums, restaurants, and Lady Bird Lake, considered one of the city's best recreational spots. The 2nd Street District consists of several new residential projects, restaurants, upscale boutiques and other entertainment venues, as well as Austin's City Hall. Across 2nd Street from Austin's City Hall is the new ACL Live @ the Moody Theatre where the long-running PBS program "Austin City Limits", is filmed. It is located at the base of the new <a href="Starwood%20Hotels%20%26amp%3B%20Resorts%20Worldwide">W Hotel</a>. The <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> is a music, film and interactive festival which occurs over five days each March in downtown Austin, and includes one of the world's largest music festivals; with more than 3,000 acts playing in more than 100 venues.

Under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>, Austin has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a>. This climate is typified by very long, hot summers; short, mild winters; and warm transitional seasons in between. Austin averages of annual rainfall and it is distributed mostly evenly throughout the year, though spring and fall are the wettest seasons. Sunshine is abundant during all seasons, with 2,650 hours, or 60.3% of the possible total, of bright sunshine per year.

The daytime high averages or warmer every day between April 14 and October 24. The highest ever recorded temperature was occurring on September 5, 2000, and August 28, 2011. Humidity is inconsistent and fluctuates frequently depending on the shifting patterns of air flow and wind direction. Humidity rises when the air drifts inland from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, but decreases significantly when the air is channeled through the <a href="Chihuahuan%20Desert">Chihuahuan Desert</a> of <a href="West%20Texas">West Texas</a>.

Winters in Austin are mild with cool nights. January is the coolest month with an average daytime high of . The overnight low reaches or exceeds freezing 19 times per year, and sinks below during 88 evenings per year, including most nights between mid-December and mid-February. Lows in the upper 30s also occur commonly during the winter. Conversely, winter months are also capable of occasionally producing warm days. On average, eight days in January reach or exceed and one day reaches . The lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was on January 31, 1949. Roughly every two years Austin experiences an <a href="ice%20storm">ice storm</a> that freezes roads over and cripples travel in the city for 24 to 48 hours. When Austin received of ice on January 24, 2014, there were 278 vehicular collisions. Similarly, snowfall is exceptionally rare in Austin. A snow event of on February 4, 2011, caused more than 300 car crashes. A snowstorm brought the city to a near standstill in 1985.

Typical of <a href="Central%20Texas">Central Texas</a>, severe weather in Austin is a threat that can strike during any season. However, it is most common during the spring. According to most classifications, Austin lies within the extreme southern periphery of <a href="Tornado%20Alley">Tornado Alley</a>, although many sources place Austin outside of Tornado Alley altogether. Consequently, tornadoes strike Austin less frequently than areas farther to the north. However, severe weather and/or <a href="supercell">supercell thunderstorms</a> can occur multiple times per year, bringing damaging winds, lightning, heavy rain, and occasional flash flooding to the city. The deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the <a href="1922%20Austin%20twin%20tornadoes">twin tornadoes storm</a> of May 4, 1922, while the deadliest <a href="tornado%20outbreak">tornado outbreak</a> to ever strike the metro area was the <a href="1997%20Central%20Texas%20tornado%20outbreak">Central Texas tornado outbreak</a> of May 27, 1997.

From October 2010 through September 2011, both major reporting stations in Austin, Camp Mabry and Bergstrom Int'l, had the least rainfall of a <a href="water%20year">water year</a> on record, receiving less than a third of normal precipitation. This was a result of <a href="La%20Ni%C3%B1a">La Niña</a> conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean where water was significantly cooler than normal. David Brown, a regional official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has explained that "these kinds of droughts will have effects that are even more extreme in the future, given a warming and drying regional climate."

According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>, the racial composition of Austin is:

A 2014 University of Texas study stated that Austin was the only U.S. city with a fast growth rate between 2000 and 2010 with a net loss in African-Americans. , Austin's African-American and <a href="Non-Hispanic%20White">Non-Hispanic White</a> percentage share of the total population is declining despite the absolute number of both ethnic groups increasing. Austin's Non-Hispanic White population first dropped below 50% in 2005. The rapid growth of the Hispanic and Asian population has outpaced all other ethnic groups in the city.

"Keep Austin Weird" has been a local <a href="motto">motto</a> for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin's eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses. According to the 2010 book, "<a href="Weird%20City">Weird City</a>", the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin's "rapid descent into commercialism and overdevelopment." The slogan has been interpreted many ways since its inception, but remains an important symbol for many Austinites who wish to voice concerns over rapid growth and irresponsible development. Austin has a long history of vocal citizen resistance to development projects perceived to degrade the environment, or to threaten the natural and cultural landscapes.

According to the <a href="Nielsen%20Company">Nielsen Company</a>, adults in Austin read and contribute to blogs more than those in any other U.S. metropolitan area. Austin residents have the highest internet usage in all of Texas. Austin was selected as the No. 2 Best Big City in "Best Places to Live" by "<a href="Money%20%28magazine%29">Money</a>" magazine in 2006, and No. 3 in 2009, and also the "<a href="Sustainability">Greenest</a> City in America" by MSN. According to "Travel & Leisure" magazine, Austin ranks No. 1 on the list of cities with the best people, referring to the personalities and attributes of the citizens. In 2012, the city was listed among the 10 best places to retire in the U.S. by "CBS Money Watch".

In 2015, "Forbes" listed Austin as #1 Boom Town because of its economic strength, including jobs among other appealing attributes.

<a href="South%20Congress">South Congress</a> is a shopping district stretching down South Congress Avenue from Downtown. This area is home to coffee shops, eccentric stores, restaurants, food trucks, trailers and festivals. It prides itself on "Keeping Austin Weird", especially with development in the surrounding area(s).

"Old Austin" is an <a href="adage">adage</a> often used by the native citizens in Austin, Texas when being nostalgic to refer to the olden days of the capital city of <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. Although Austin is also known internationally as the <a href="Music%20of%20Austin%2C%20Texas">live music capital of the world</a> and its catch phrase/slogan Keep Austin Weird can be heard echoed in places as far as <a href="Buffalo%2C%20NY">Buffalo, NY</a> and <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20CA">Santa Monica, CA</a> - the term "Old Austin" refers to a time when the city was smaller and more <a href="bohemian">bohemian</a> with a considerably lower cost of living and better known for its lack of traffic, <a href="Hipster%20%28contemporary%20subculture%29">hipsters</a>, and <a href="urban%20sprawl">urban sprawl</a>. It is often employed by longtime residents expressing displeasure at the rapidly changing culture.

The growth and popularity of Austin can be seen by the expansive development taking place in its downtown landscape. Forbes ranked Austin as the second fastest-growing city in 2015. This growth can have a negative impact on longtime small businesses that cannot keep up with the expenses associated with <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a> and the rising cost of real estate.

The <a href="O.%20Henry%20House">O. Henry House</a> Museum hosts the annual <a href="O.%20Henry%20Pun-Off">O. Henry Pun-Off</a>, a pun contest where the successful contestants exhibit wit akin to that of the author <a href="William%20Sydney%20Porter">William Sydney Porter</a>.

Every year around the end of March and the beginning of April, Austin is home to "Texas Relay Weekend."

Austin's Zilker Park Tree is a Christmas display made of lights strung from the top of a <a href="Moonlight%20tower">Moonlight tower</a> in Zilker Park. The Zilker Tree is lit in December along with the "Trail of Lights," an Austin Christmas tradition. The Trail of Lights were cancelled four times, first starting in 2001 and 2002 due to the September 11 Attacks, and again in 2010 and 2011 due to budget shortfalls, but the trail was turned back on for the 2012 holiday season.

As Austin's official slogan is "The Live Music Capital of the World", the city has a vibrant live <a href="Music%20of%20Austin">music scene</a> with more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city. Austin's music revolves around the many <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a>s on 6th Street and an annual film/music/<a href="interactive">interactive</a> festival known as <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> (SXSW). The concentration of restaurants, bars, and music venues in the city's downtown core is a major contributor to Austin's live music scene, as the zip code encompassing the downtown entertainment district hosts the most bar or alcohol-serving establishments in the U.S.

The city had 39 homicides in 2016, the most since 1997.
FBI Statistics show that overall violent and property crimes dropped in Austin in 2015, but increased in suburban areas of the city.
One such Southeastern suburb, <a href="Del%20Valle%2C%20Texas">Del Valle</a> reported 8 homicides within 2 months in 2016.

Austin is administered by an 11-member <a href="city%20council">city council</a> (10 council members elected by geographic district plus a mayor elected at large). The council is accompanied by a hired <a href="city%20manager">city manager</a> under the manager-council system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012 changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current "10+1" district system. November 2014 marked the first election under the new system.

Austin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street. Antoine Predock and Cotera Kolar Negrete & Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" referred to as a "crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger." The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage. The city hall, at 301 West Second Street, opened in November 2004. The mayor of Austin is <a href="Steve%20Adler%20%28lawyer%29">Steve Adler</a>.

Law enforcement in Austin is provided by the <a href="Austin%20Police%20Department">Austin Police Department</a>, except for state government buildings, which are patrolled by the <a href="Texas%20Department%20of%20Public%20Safety">Texas Department of Public Safety</a>. The University of Texas Police operate from the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas</a>.

Fire protection within the city limits is provided by the <a href="Austin%20Fire%20Department">Austin Fire Department</a>, while the surrounding county is divided into twelve geographical areas known as Emergency Services Districts, which are covered by separate regional fire departments. Emergency Medical Services are provided for the whole county by "Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services".

The <a href="Texas%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Texas Department of Transportation</a> operates the Austin District Office in Austin.

The <a href="Texas%20Department%20of%20Criminal%20Justice">Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> (TDCJ) operates the Austin I and Austin II district parole offices in Austin.

The <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> operates several post offices in Austin.

Austin is known as an enclave of <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a> politics in an otherwise conservative state—so much so, that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the "People's Republic of Austin" by residents of other parts of Texas, and conservatives in the Texas Legislature.

Since redistricting following the 2010 United States Census, Austin has been divided between six congressional districts at the federal level: <a href="Texas%27s%2035th%20congressional%20district">Texas's 35th</a>, <a href="Texas%27s%2025th%20congressional%20district">Texas's 25th</a>, <a href="Texas%27s%2010th%20congressional%20district">Texas's 10th</a>, <a href="Texas%27s%2021st%20congressional%20district">Texas's 21st</a>, <a href="Texas%27s%2017th%20congressional%20district">Texas's 17th</a>, and <a href="Texas%27s%2031st%20congressional%20district">Texas's 31st</a>. Texas's 35th congressional district is represented by Democrat <a href="Lloyd%20Doggett">Lloyd Doggett</a>. The other five districts are represented by Republicans, of whom only one, <a href="Michael%20McCaul">Michael McCaul</a> of the 10th district, lives in <a href="Travis%20County%2C%20Texas">Travis County</a>.

As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, while the suburbs tend to vote <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>. A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the <a href="2003%20Texas%20redistricting">2003 Texas redistricting</a>. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan <a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>, and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. <a href="Lloyd%20Doggett">Lloyd Doggett</a>'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced <a href="minority%20influence">minority influence</a> in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.

Overall, the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole. The city last went to a Republican candidate in 2000 when former Texas Governor George W. Bush successfully ran for President. In 2004, the Democrats rebounded strongly as John Kerry enjoyed a 14.0% margin over Bush, who once again won Texas.

City residents have been supportive of alternative candidates; for example, <a href="Ralph%20Nader%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202000">Ralph Nader</a> won 10.4% of the vote in Austin in 2000.

In 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the <a href="USA%20PATRIOT%20Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a> that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights. Of Austin's six state legislative districts, three are strongly Democratic and three are swing districts, two of which are held by Democrats and one of which is held by a Republican. However, two of its three congressional districts (the <a href="Texas%27s%2010th%20congressional%20district">10th</a> and the <a href="Texas%27s%2021st%20congressional%20district">21st</a>) are presently held by Republicans, with only the <a href="Texas%27s%2025th%20congressional%20district">25th</a> held by a Democrat. This is largely due to the 2003 redistricting, which left downtown Austin without an exclusive congressional seat of its own. Travis County was also the only county in Texas to reject Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).

Two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called Austin home. <a href="Michael%20Badnarik">Michael Badnarik</a>, the Libertarian Party candidate, and <a href="David%20Cobb">David Cobb</a> of the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Green Party</a> both had lived in Austin. During the run up to the election in November, a presidential debate was held at the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> student union involving the two candidates. While the <a href="Commission%20on%20Presidential%20Debates">Commission on Presidential Debates</a> only invites Democrats and Republicans to participate in televised debates, the debate at UT was open to all presidential candidates. Austin also hosted one of the last presidential debates between <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> during their heated race for the Democratic nomination in 2008.

In the 2016 presidential election, Travis County, which contains the majority of Austin, voted for <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> (D) by a 38.9-point margin (66.3% to 27.4%).

The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy), and eventually the current ongoing debate about "sense of place" and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin "sense of place." In 2012, Austin became just one of a few cities in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> to ban the sale and use of plastic bags.

Researchers at <a href="Central%20Connecticut%20State%20University">Central Connecticut State University</a> ranked Austin the 16th most literate city in the United States for 2008. The <a href="Austin%20Public%20Library">Austin Public Library</a> operates the <a href="John%20Henry%20Faulk">John Henry Faulk</a> Library and various library branches. In addition, the University of Texas at Austin operates the seventh-largest academic library in the nation.

Austin was voted "America's No.1 College Town" by the Travel Channel. Over 43 percent of Austin residents age 25 and over hold a bachelor's degree, while 16 percent hold a graduate degree. In 2009, greater Austin ranked eighth among metropolitan areas in the United States for bachelor's degree attainment with nearly 39 percent of area residents over 25 holding a bachelor's degree.

Austin is home to the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, the flagship institution of the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20System">University of Texas System</a> with over 38,000 undergraduate students and 12,000 graduate students.

Central Austin lies between two major north-south freeways: <a href="Interstate%2035%20in%20Texas">Interstate 35</a> to the east and the <a href="State%20Highway%20Loop%201%20%28Texas%29">Mopac Expressway (Loop 1)</a> to the west. <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20183%20%28Texas%29">U.S. Highway 183</a> runs from northwest to southeast, and <a href="State%20Highway%2071%20%28Texas%29">State Highway 71</a> crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough "box" around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

<a href="U.S.%20Highway%20290%20%28Texas%29">U.S. Highway 290</a> enters Austin from the east and merges into Interstate 35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of Highway 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as "The Y." Highway 71 continues to <a href="Brady%2C%20Texas">Brady, Texas</a>, and Highway 290 continues west to intersect <a href="Interstate%2010%20in%20Texas">Interstate 10</a> near <a href="Junction%2C%20Texas">Junction</a>. Interstate 35 continues south through <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a> to <a href="Laredo%2C%20Texas">Laredo</a> on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in northern Texas. There are two links to Houston, Texas (Highway 290 and State Highway 71/Interstate 10). Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin toward <a href="Lampasas%2C%20Texas">Lampasas</a>.

In the mid-1980s, construction was completed on <a href="State%20Highway%20Loop%20360%20%28Texas%29">Loop 360</a>, a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic <a href="Pennybacker%20Bridge">Pennybacker Bridge</a>, also known as the "360 Bridge", crosses Lake Austin to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.

<a href="State%20Highway%20130%20%28Texas%29">State Highway 130</a> is a bypass route designed to relieve traffic congestion, starting from Interstate 35 just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses <a href="Round%20Rock%2C%20Texas">Round Rock</a>, Austin, <a href="San%20Marcos%2C%20Texas">San Marcos</a> and <a href="New%20Braunfels%2C%20Texas">New Braunfels</a> before ending at <a href="Interstate%2010">Interstate 10</a> east of <a href="Seguin%2C%20Texas">Seguin</a>, where drivers could drive west to return to Interstate 35 in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio</a>. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of <a href="Austin%E2%80%93Bergstrom%20International%20Airport">Austin–Bergstrom International Airport</a> at Austin's southeast corner on <a href="State%20Highway%2071%20%28Texas%29">State Highway 71</a>. Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from <a href="Pflugerville%2C%20Texas">Pflugerville</a> on the north until it reaches <a href="US%20Highway%20183">US 183</a> well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least . The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of , the highest posted <a href="speed%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">speed limit in the United States</a>.

<a href="State%20Highway%2045%20%28Texas%29">State Highway 45</a> runs east-west from just south of Highway 183 in <a href="Cedar%20Park%2C%20Texas">Cedar Park</a> to 130 inside <a href="Pflugerville%2C%20Texas">Pflugerville</a> (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the <a href="FM%201327">FM 1327</a>/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and <a href="Buda%2C%20Texas">Buda</a>. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of <a href="Leander%2C%20Texas">Leander</a> and <a href="Cedar%20Park%2C%20Texas">Cedar Park</a>. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.
Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.

Austin's airport is <a href="Austin%E2%80%93Bergstrom%20International%20Airport">Austin–Bergstrom International Airport</a> (ABIA) ( AUS), located southeast of the city.

The <a href="Capital%20Metropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority">Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> ("Capital Metro") provides public transportation to the city, primarily by bus. Some heavily utilized routes feature <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a>, with long, train-like, high-tech buses.

Capital Metro opened a <a href="regional%20rail">commuter rail</a> system known as <a href="Capital%20MetroRail">Capital MetroRail</a> on March 22, 2010. The system was built on existing freight rail lines and serves downtown Austin, East Austin, North Central Austin, Northwest Austin, and Leander in its first phase. Future expansion could include a line to Manor and another to Round Rock. The MetroRail system has struggled to build ridership and has faced heavy criticism for its high per-rider cost to the public.

Capital Metro has also explored building a <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> system to connect the MetroRail line to key destinations in Central Austin. On August 7, 2014, the Austin City Council unanimously voted to place a $600 million light rail bond proposal on the November 4, 2014 ballot; the ballot measure was voted down, and no further rail expansions have been put to voters since.

Argument from morality

The argument from morality is an argument for the <a href="existence%20of%20God">existence of God</a>. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that <a href="God">God</a> is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The argument from morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in <a href="meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a>.

German philosopher <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> devised an argument from morality based on <a href="practical%20reason">practical reason</a>. Kant argued that the goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the <a href="summum%20bonum">summum bonum</a>) and believed that an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a> must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. In his book "<a href="Mere%20Christianity">Mere Christianity</a>", <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> argued that "conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver." Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a> argued that the <a href="conscience">conscience</a> supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths.

All variations of the argument from morality begin with an observation about moral thought or experiences and conclude with the existence of God. Some of these arguments propose moral facts which they claim evident through human experience, arguing that God is the best explanation for these. Other versions describe some end which humans should strive to attain, only possible if God exists.

Many arguments from morality are based on moral normativity, which suggests that objective moral truths exist and require God's existence to give them authority. Often, they consider that morality seems to be binding – obligations are seen to convey more than just a preference, but imply that the obligation will stand, regardless of other factors or interests. For morality to be binding, God must exist. In its most general form, the argument from moral normativity is:


Some arguments from moral order suggest that morality is based on rationality and that this can only be the case if there is a moral order in the universe. The arguments propose that only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the universe, so God must exist. Alternative arguments from moral order have proposed that we have an obligation to attain the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue. They attest that whatever we are obliged to do must be possible, and achieving the perfect good of both happiness and moral virtue is only possible if a natural moral order exists. A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so God must exist.

In his "<a href="Critique%20of%20Pure%20Reason">Critique of Pure Reason</a>", German philosopher <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> stated that no successful argument for God's existence arises from <a href="reason">reason</a> alone. In his "<a href="Critique%20of%20Practical%20Reason">Critique of Practical Reason</a>" he went on to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the "<a href="summum%20bonum">summum bonum</a>": the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As <a href="ought%20implies%20can">ought implies can</a>, Kant argued, it must be possible for the "summum bonum" to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the "summum bonum" about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a> where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.

Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes a common objection to Kant's argument: that what ought to be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a> as an example which does not require the "summum bonum". Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only <a href="logical%20consequence">entail</a> that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.

Both theists and non-theists have accepted that the existence of objective moral truths might entail the existence of God. <a href="Atheism">Atheist</a> philosopher <a href="J.%20L.%20Mackie">J. L. Mackie</a> accepted that, if objective moral truths existed, they would warrant a supernatural explanation. Scottish philosopher <a href="W.%20R.%20Sorley">W. R. Sorley</a> presented the following argument:

Many critics have challenged the second premise of this argument, by offering a biological and sociological account of the development of human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> and philosopher <a href="Michael%20Ruse">Michael Ruse</a>, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of <a href="evolution">evolutionary pressures</a>, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end of that particular society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a> made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.

Because evolutionary naturalism proposes an <a href="empiricism">empirical</a> account of morality, it does not require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to <a href="moral%20scepticism">moral scepticism</a> or <a href="antirealism">antirealism</a>. <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of <a href="divine%20command%20theory">divine command theory</a> which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.

J.C.A. Gaskin challenges the first premise of the argument from moral objectivity, arguing that it must be shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is <a href="divine%20command%20theory">commanded by God</a>, rather than simply a human invention. It could be the consent of humanity that gives it moral force, for example. American philosopher <a href="Michael%20Martin%20%28philosopher%29">Michael Martin</a> argues that it is not <a href="logical%20truth">necessarily true</a> that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations: he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and, even if a supernatural explanation is necessary, it does not have to be God (polytheism is a viable alternative). Martin also argues that a non-objective account of ethics might be acceptable and challenges the view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy.

Related to the argument from morality is the argument from conscience, associated with eighteenth-century bishop <a href="Joseph%20Butler">Joseph Butler</a> and nineteenth-century cardinal <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a>. Newman proposed that the <a href="conscience">conscience</a>, as well as giving moral guidance, provides evidence of objective moral truths which must be supported by the divine. He argued that emotivism is an inadequate explanation of the human experience of morality because people avoid acting immorally, even when it might be in their interests. Newman proposed that, to explain the conscience, God must exist.

British philosopher <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> argued that moral rules cannot be established from conscience because the differences in people's consciences would lead to contradictions. Locke also noted that the conscience is influenced by "education, company, and customs of the country", a criticism mounted by J. L. Mackie, who argued that the conscience should be seen as an "introjection" of other people into an agent's mind. Michael Martin challenges the argument from conscience with a naturalistic account of conscience, arguing that naturalism provides an adequate explanation for the conscience without the need for God's existence. He uses the example of the internalisation by humans of social pressures, which leads to the fear of going against these norms. Even if a supernatural cause is required, he argues, it could be something other than God; this would mean that the phenomenon of the conscience is no more supportive of <a href="monotheism">monotheism</a> than polytheism.

Auschwitz concentration camp

Auschwitz concentration camp (, , also ' or ') was a network of <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a> and <a href="extermination%20camp">extermination camp</a>s built and operated by the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Third Reich</a> in <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It consisted of (the original camp), Auschwitz II–Birkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), (a labor camp to staff an <a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> factory), and 45 satellite camps.

Auschwitz I was first constructed to hold Polish <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination of prisoners took place in September 1941, and Auschwitz II–Birkenau went on to become a major site of the Nazi <a href="Final%20Solution%20to%20the%20Jewish%20Question">Final Solution to the Jewish Question</a>. From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered <a href="Jews">Jews</a> to the camp's <a href="gas%20chamber">gas chamber</a>s from all over <a href="German-occupied%20Europe">German-occupied Europe</a>, where they were killed en masse with the pesticide <a href="Zyklon%20B">Zyklon B</a>. An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1 million died. Around 90 percent of those killed were Jewish; approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 <a href="Poles">Poles</a>, 23,000 <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> and <a href="Sinti">Sinti</a>, 15,000 <a href="Nazi%20crimes%20against%20Soviet%20POWs">Soviet prisoners of war</a>, 400 <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, and tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of homosexuals. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor, <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, individual executions, and medical experiments.

In the course of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German "<a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>" (SS), approximately 12 percent of whom were later convicted of <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s. Some, including camp commandant <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a>, were executed. The <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied Powers</a> refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways <a href="Auschwitz%20bombing%20debate">remains controversial</a>. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two "<a href="Sonderkommando">Sonderkommando</a>" units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.

As <a href="Red%20Army">Soviet troops</a> approached Auschwitz in January 1945, most of its population was sent west on a <a href="Death%20marches%20%28Holocaust%29">death march</a>. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as <a href="International%20Holocaust%20Remembrance%20Day">International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>. In the following decades, survivors, such as <a href="Primo%20Levi">Primo Levi</a>, <a href="Viktor%20Frankl">Viktor Frankl</a>, and <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the <a href="Auschwitz-Birkenau%20State%20Museum">Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum</a> on the site of Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>.

The ideology of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> brought together elements of <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitism</a>, <a href="racial%20hygiene">racial hygiene</a>, and <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, and combined them with <a href="pan-Germanism">pan-Germanism</a> and territorial expansionism with the goal of obtaining more "<a href="Lebensraum">Lebensraum</a>" (living space) for the Germanic people. Immediately after the <a href="Nazi%20seizure%20of%20power">Nazi seizure of power</a> in Germany, acts of violence perpetrated against Jews became ubiquitous. The <a href="Law%20for%20the%20Restoration%20of%20the%20Professional%20Civil%20Service">Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service</a>, passed on 7 April 1933 excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of the right to practise. Harassment and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to leave the country voluntarily. Their businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of government contracts. <a href="German%20Jews">German Jews</a> were subjected to violent attacks and boycotts. 

In September 1935, the <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">Nuremberg Laws</a> were enacted. These laws prohibited marriages between Jews and people of Germanic extraction, extramarital relations between Jews and Germans, and the employment of German women under the age of 45 as domestic servants in Jewish households. The Reich Citizenship Law stated that only those of Germanic or related blood were defined as citizens. Thus Jews and other minority groups were stripped of their German citizenship. The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include <a href="Romani%20people">Romani people</a> and <a href="Afro-Germans">Afro-Germans</a>. This supplementary decree defined Gypsies as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews. By the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, the United Kingdom, and other countries. 

<a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">invaded Poland</a> in September 1939. German dictator <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed. Approximately 65,000 civilians, who were viewed as being inferior to the <a href="Aryan%20race">Aryan</a> <a href="master%20race">master race</a>, were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, the Nazis killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani, and the mentally ill. SS-"<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenführer</a>" <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, then head of the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, ordered on 21 September that <a href="Polish%20Jews">Polish Jews</a> should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east, or possibly to <a href="Madagascar%20Plan">Madagascar</a>. Two years later, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invaded the Soviet Union</a>, intending to deport or kill the Jews and <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> living there.

After this part of Poland was <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">annexed by Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim">Oświęcim</a> (Auschwitz) was located administratively in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Upper%20Silesia">Province of Upper Silesia</a>, <a href="Regierungsbezirk%20Kattowitz">Regierungsbezirk Kattowitz</a>, Landkreis Bielitz. It was first suggested as a site for a <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camp</a> for Polish prisoners by "<a href="SS-Oberf%C3%BChrer">SS-Oberführer</a>" <a href="Arpad%20Wigand">Arpad Wigand</a>, an aide to <a href="Higher%20SS%20and%20Police%20Leader">Higher SS and Police Leader</a> for Silesia, <a href="Erich%20von%20dem%20Bach-Zelewski">Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski</a>. Bach-Zelewski had been searching for a site to house prisoners in the Silesia region, as the local prisons were filled to capacity. <a href="Richard%20Gl%C3%BCcks">Richard Glücks</a>, head of the <a href="Concentration%20Camps%20Inspectorate">Concentration Camps Inspectorate</a>, sent former <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a> commandant <a href="Walter%20Eisfeld">Walter Eisfeld</a> to inspect the site, which already held sixteen dilapidated one-story buildings that had once served as an Austrian and later Polish Army barracks and a camp for transient workers. "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, head of the "<a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>" (SS), approved the site in April 1940, intending to use the facility to house political prisoners. SS-"<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmbannführer</a>" (lieutenant colonel) <a href="Rudolf%20H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a> oversaw the development of the camp and served as the first commandant. SS-"<a href="Obersturmf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmführer</a>" (senior lieutenant) <a href="Josef%20Kramer">Josef Kramer</a> was appointed Höss's deputy. Auschwitz I, the original camp, became the administrative center for the whole complex.

Local residents were evicted, including 1,200 people who lived in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Poles%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">expulsions of Poles</a> from the villages of <a href="Broszkowice">Broszkowice</a>, <a href="Babice%2C%20O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim%20County">Babice</a>, <a href="Brzezinka">Brzezinka</a>, <a href="Rajsko%2C%20O%C5%9Bwi%C4%99cim%20County">Rajsko</a>, <a href="P%C5%82awy">Pławy</a>, <a href="Harm%C4%99%C5%BCe">Harmęże</a>, <a href="B%C3%B3r%2C%20Lesser%20Poland%20Voivodeship">Bór</a>, and Budy to the <a href="General%20Government">General Government</a>. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.

The first prisoners (30 German criminal prisoners from the <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a>) arrived in May 1940, intended to act as functionaries within the prison system. The <a href="first%20mass%20transport%20to%20Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">first mass transport to Auschwitz concentration camp</a>, which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in <a href="Tarn%C3%B3w">Tarnów</a>, Poland, on 14 June 1940. They were interned in the former building of the Polish Tobacco Monopoly, adjacent to the site, until the camp was ready.

The inmate population grew quickly as the camp absorbed Poland's intelligentsia and dissidents, including the <a href="Polish%20resistance%20movement%20in%20World%20War%20II">Polish underground resistance</a>. By March 1941, 10,900 were imprisoned there, most of them Poles. By the end of 1940, the SS had confiscated land in the surrounding area to create a "zone of interest" surrounded by a double ring of electrified barbed wire fences and watchtowers. Like other Nazi concentration camps, the gates to Auschwitz I displayed the motto "<a href="Arbeit%20macht%20frei">Arbeit macht frei</a>" ("Work brings freedom").

The victories of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> in the summer and fall of 1941 against Hitler's new enemy, the Soviet Union, led to dramatic changes in Nazi anti-Jewish ideology and the profile of prisoners brought to Auschwitz. Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, head of the "<a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>" (SS), intended the camp to house 50,000 <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, who would be interned as forced laborers. Plans called for the expansion of the camp first to house 150,000 and eventually as many as 200,000 inmates. An initial contingent of 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Auschwitz I in October 1941, but by March 1942 only 945 were still alive, and these were transferred to Birkenau, where most of them died from disease or starvation by May. By this time Hitler had decided to annihilate the Jewish people, so Birkenau was repurposed as a combination labor camp/<a href="extermination%20camp">extermination camp</a>. The <a href="Auschwitz-Birkenau%20Memorial%20and%20Museum">Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum</a> estimates that 1.3 million people, 1.1 million of them Jewish, were sent to the camp during its existence.

The chief of construction of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was <a href="Karl%20Bischoff">Karl Bischoff</a>. Unlike his predecessor, he was a competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, in spite of the ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four <a href="crematorium">crematoria</a>, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.

The first <a href="gas%20chamber">gas chamber</a> at Birkenau was the "red house" (called Bunker 1 by SS staff), a brick cottage converted into a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows. It was operational by March 1942. A second brick cottage, the "white house" or Bunker 2, was converted some weeks later. These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943. Himmler visited the camp in person on 17 and 18 July 1942. He was given a demonstration of a mass killing using the gas chamber in Bunker 2 and toured the building site of the new <a href="IG%20Farben">IG Farben</a> plant being constructed at the nearby town of <a href="Monowitz">Monowitz</a>.

In early 1943, the Nazis decided to increase greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, which had been designed as a mortuary with morgues in the basement and ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the <a href="Zyklon%20B">Zyklon B</a> (a highly lethal <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>-based <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed using these four structures.

On 10 December 1942, Himmler issued an order to send all <a href="Sinti">Sinti</a> and Roma (Gypsies) to concentration camps, including Auschwitz. A separate camp for Roma was set up at Auschwitz II-Birkenau known as the "Zigeunerfamilienlager" (Gypsy Family Camp). The first transport of German Gypsies arrived on 26 February 1943, and was housed in Section B-IIe of Auschwitz II. Approximately 23,000 Gypsies had been brought to Auschwitz by 1944, 20,000 of whom died there. One transport of 1,700 Polish Sinti and Roma were killed in the gas chambers upon arrival, as they were suspected to be ill with <a href="spotted%20fever">spotted fever</a>.

Gypsy prisoners were used primarily for construction work. Thousands died of typhus and <a href="Noma%20%28disease%29">noma</a> due to overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and malnutrition. Anywhere from 1,400 to 3,000 prisoners were transferred to other concentration camps before the murder of the remaining population.

On 2 August 1944, the SS cleared the Gypsy camp. A witness in another part of the camp later told of the Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The surviving population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the <a href="Romani%20language">Romani language</a> as the <a href="Porajmos">Porajmos</a> (devouring).

After examining several sites for a new plant to manufacture buna, a type of <a href="synthetic%20rubber">synthetic rubber</a> essential to the war effort, chemicals manufacturer IG Farben chose a site near the towns of <a href="Dwory%20II">Dwory</a> and Monowice (Monowitz in German), about east of Auschwitz I and east of the town of Oświęcim. Financial support in the form of tax exemptions was available to corporations prepared to develop industries in the frontier regions under the Eastern Fiscal Assistance Law, passed in December 1940. In addition to its proximity to the concentration camp, which could be used as a source of cheap labor, the site had good railway connections and access to raw materials. In February 1941, Himmler ordered that the Jewish population of Oświęcim should be expelled to make way for skilled laborers that would be brought in to work at the plant. All Poles able to work were to remain in the town and were forced to work building the factory. Himmler visited in person in March and decreed an immediate expansion of the parent camp to house 30,000 persons. Development of the camp at Birkenau began about six months later. Construction of IG Auschwitz began in April, with an initial force of 1,000 workers from Auschwitz I assigned to work on the construction. This number increased to 7,000 in 1943 and 11,000 in 1944. Over the course of its history, about 35,000 inmates in total worked at the plant; 25,000 died as a result of malnutrition, disease, and the physically impossible workload. In addition to the concentration camp inmates, who comprised a third of the work force, IG Auschwitz employed slave laborers from all over Europe.

At first, the laborers walked the seven kilometers from Auschwitz I to the plant each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the "ArbeitsausbildungLager" (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced to work on the building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.

Various other German industrial enterprises, such as <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> and <a href="Siemens-Schuckert">Siemens-Schuckert</a>, built factories with their own subcamps. There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the armaments industry. Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand. Subcamps were built at <a href="Blechhammer">Blechhammer</a>, <a href="Jawiszowice">Jawiszowice</a>, <a href="Central%20Labour%20Camp%20Jaworzno">Jaworzno</a>, <a href="B%C4%99dzin">Lagisze</a>, <a href="Mys%C5%82owice">Mysłowice</a>, <a href="Trzebinia">Trzebinia</a>, and other centers as far afield as the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</a>. Satellite camps were designated as "Aussenlager" (external camp), "Nebenlager" (extension or subcamp), or "Arbeitslager" (labor camp). Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, chemical plants, and other industries. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.

In mid-1944, about 130,000 prisoners were present in Auschwitz when the SS started to move about half of them to other concentration camps. In November 1944, with the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, Himmler ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich. The crematorium IV building was dismantled, and the "<a href="Sonderkommando">Sonderkommando</a>" were ordered to begin removing evidence of the killings, including the mass graves. The SS destroyed written records, and in the final week before the camp's liberation, burned or demolished many of its buildings. The plundered goods from the 'Canada' barracks at Birkenau together with building supplies were transported to the German interior. On 20 January, the overflowing warehouses were set ablaze. On the same day, the gas chambers as well as crematoria II and III at Birkenau were blown up. The raging fires lasted for several days. On 26 January 1945, the last crematorium V at Birkenau was demolished with explosives just one day ahead of the Soviet attack. 

Himmler ordered the evacuation of all camps in January 1945, charging camp commanders with "making sure that not a single prisoner from the concentration camps falls alive into the hands of the enemy." On 17 January, 56,000–58,000 Auschwitz detainees, of whom two-thirds were Jews, were evacuated under guard, largely on foot, in severe winter conditions. Thousands of them died in the subsequent <a href="Death%20marches%20%28Holocaust%29">death march</a> west towards <a href="Wodzis%C5%82aw%20%C5%9Al%C4%85ski">Wodzisław Śląski</a>. The guards shot all prisoners who were unable to march at the imposed pace. <a href="Peter%20Longerich">Peter Longerich</a> estimates that a quarter of the detainees were thus killed. A column of inmates reached <a href="Gross-Rosen%20concentration%20camp">Gross-Rosen concentration camp</a> complex. Throughout February, the terribly overcrowded main camp at Gross-Rosen was cleared, and all 44,000 inmates were moved further west. An unknown number died in this last journey. In March 1945, Himmler ordered that no more prisoners should be killed, as he hoped to use them as hostages in negotiations with the Allies. Approximately 20,000 Auschwitz prisoners made it to <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a> in Germany, where they were liberated by the British in April 1945. 

When Auschwitz was liberated on 26 and 27 January by the <a href="322nd%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">322nd Rifle Division</a> of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, the soldiers found 7,500 prisoners alive and over 600 corpses. Among items found by the Soviet soldiers were 370,000 men's suits, 837,000 women's garments, and of human hair. The camp's liberation received little press attention at the time. In historian <a href="Laurence%20Rees">Laurence Rees</a>' opinion, this was due to three factors: the previous discovery of similar crimes at <a href="Majdanek%20concentration%20camp">Majdanek concentration camp</a>, competing news from the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Allied summit at Yalta</a>, and the Soviet Union's interest, for propaganda purposes, in minimizing attention to Jewish suffering. Due to the vast extent of the camp area, at least four divisions took part in liberating the camp: 100th Rifle Division (established in <a href="Vologda">Vologda, Russia</a>), <a href="322nd%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">322nd Rifle Division</a> (<a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod">Gorky, Russia</a>), 286th Rifle Division (<a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a>), and 107th Motor Rifle Division (<a href="Tambov">Tambov, Russia</a>).

Auschwitz II Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army at around 3:30 p.m. on 27 January 1945, and the main camp (Auschwitz I) two hours later. Military trucks loaded with bread arrived the next day. Volunteers began to offer first aid and improvised assistance the following week. In early February, the <a href="Polish%20Red%20Cross">Polish Red Cross</a> hospital opened in blocks 14, 21, and 22 at Auschwitz I, headed by Dr. Józef Bellert and staffed by 30 volunteer doctors and nurses from <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, along with around 90 former inmates. The critically injured patients – estimated at several thousands – were relocated from Birkenau and Monowitz to the main camp. Some orphaned children were immediately adopted by Oświęcim residents, while others were transferred to Kraków, where a number of them were adopted by Polish families. Others were placed in an orphanage at <a href="Harbutowice%2C%20Silesian%20Voivodeship">Harbutowice</a>.

The hospital cared for more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from <a href="starvation">starvation</a>, alimentary <a href="dystrophy">dystrophy</a>, <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a>, <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, internal <a href="haemorrhaging">haemorrhaging</a>, and <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and <a href="Brzeszcze">Brzeszcze</a>, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.

In June 1945 the Soviet authorities took over Auschwitz I and converted it to a POW camp for German prisoners. The hospital had to move beyond the camp perimeter into former administrative buildings, where it functioned until October 1945.

Early on, many barracks at Birkenau were taken apart by civilians who used the materials to rebuild their own homes, levelled out in the construction of Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.

After the site became a museum in 1947, exhumation work lasted for more than a decade. <a href="Antoni%20Dobrowolski">Antoni Dobrowolski</a>, the oldest known survivor of Auschwitz, died aged 108 on 21 October 2012, in <a href="D%C4%99bno">Dębno</a>, Poland.

Camp commandant Rudolf Höss was pursued by the <a href="British%20Intelligence%20Corps">British Intelligence Corps</a>, who arrested him at a farm near <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, Germany, on 11 March 1946. Höss confessed to his role in the mass killings at Auschwitz in his memoirs and in his trial before the <a href="Supreme%20National%20Tribunal">Supreme National Tribunal</a> in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Poland. He was convicted of murder, returned to Auschwitz and hanged at the site of his crimes on 16 April 1947.

Around 12 percent of Auschwitz's 6,500 staff who survived the war were eventually brought to trial. Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial. On 25 November 1947, the <a href="Auschwitz%20Trial">Auschwitz Trial</a> began in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, when Poland's <a href="Supreme%20National%20Tribunal">Supreme National Tribunal</a> brought to court 40 former Auschwitz staff. The trial's defendants included commandant <a href="Arthur%20Liebehenschel">Arthur Liebehenschel</a>, women's camp leader <a href="Maria%20Mandel">Maria Mandel</a>, and camp leader <a href="Hans%20Aumeier">Hans Aumeier</a>. The trials ended on 22 December 1947, with 23 death sentences, 7 life sentences, and 9 prison sentences ranging from three to fifteen years. <a href="Hans%20M%C3%BCnch">Hans Münch</a>, an SS doctor who had several former prisoners testify on his behalf, was the only person to be acquitted.

Other former staff were hanged for war crimes in the <a href="Dachau%20Trials">Dachau Trials</a> and the <a href="Belsen%20Trial">Belsen Trial</a>, including camp leaders <a href="Josef%20Kramer">Josef Kramer</a>, <a href="Franz%20H%C3%B6ssler">Franz Hössler</a>, and <a href="Vinzenz%20Sch%C3%B6ttl">Vinzenz Schöttl</a>; doctor <a href="Friedrich%20Entress">Friedrich Entress</a>; and guards <a href="Irma%20Grese">Irma Grese</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20Volkenrath">Elisabeth Volkenrath</a>. The <a href="Frankfurt%20Auschwitz%20Trials">Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials</a>, held in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> from 20 December 1963 to 20 August 1965, convicted 17 of 22 defendants, giving them prison sentences ranging from life to three years and three months. <a href="Bruno%20Tesch">Bruno Tesch</a> and <a href="Karl%20Weinbacher">Karl Weinbacher</a>, the owner and the chief executive officer of the firm <a href="Tesch%20%26amp%3B%20Stabenow">Tesch & Stabenow</a>, one of the suppliers of Zyklon B, were executed for knowingly supplying the chemical for use on humans.

Camp guards were members of the "<a href="SS-Totenkopfverb%C3%A4nde">SS-Totenkopfverbände</a>" (<a href="Totenkopf">Death's Head</a> Units). Around 7,000 SS personnel in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war. Of these, 4 percent of SS personnel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members. Approximately three in four SS personnel worked in security. Others worked in the medical or political departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was responsible for the property of dead prisoners. SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers. The overall command authority for the entire camp was Department D (the <a href="Concentration%20Camps%20Inspectorate">Concentration Camps Inspectorate</a>) of the "<a href="SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt">SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt</a>" (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA).
Auschwitz was considered a comfortable posting by many SS members, due to its many amenities and the abundance of slave labor. Of the various prisoner groups, SS officers preferred <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> for household slaves because of their nonviolent behavior. Höss lived with his wife and children in a villa just outside the camp grounds. Other SS personnel were also initially allowed to bring fiancees, wives, and children to live at the camp, but when the SS camp grew more crowded, Höss restricted further arrivals. Facilities for the SS personnel and their families included a library, swimming pool, coffee house, and a theater that hosted regular performances.

One prisoner in each work detail or prisoner block—usually an Aryan—was appointed as a "<a href="Kapo%20%28concentration%20camp%29">Kapo</a>" ("head" or "overseer"). The "Kapos" received better rations and lodging and wielded tremendous power over other prisoners, whom they often abused. Very few "Kapos" were prosecuted after the war, due to the difficulty in determining which "Kapo" atrocities had been performed under SS orders and which had been individual actions.

About 120 SS personnel were assigned to the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk of the work was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as "<a href="Sonderkommando">Sonderkommando</a>s" (special squads). "Sonderkommando" responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.

The "Sonderkommado" were housed separately from other prisoners, in somewhat better conditions. Their quality of life was further improved by access to the goods taken from murdered prisoners, which "Sonderkommandos" were sometimes able to steal for themselves and to trade on Auschwitz's black market. Hungarian doctor Miklós Nyiszli reported that the "Sonderkommando" numbered around 860 prisoners when the Hungarian Jews were being killed in 1944. Many "Sonderkommandos" committed suicide due to the horrors of their work; those who did not generally were shot by the SS in a matter of weeks, and new "Sonderkommando" units were then formed from incoming transports. Almost none of the 2,000 prisoners placed in these units survived to the camp's liberation.

The prisoners' day began at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Nyiszli">Miklós Nyiszli</a> describes roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz at that time of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.

After roll call, the "<a href="Kommando">Kommando</a>", or work details, walked to their place of work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks. A prisoner's orchestra (such as the <a href="Women%27s%20Orchestra%20of%20Auschwitz">Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz</a>) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. "Kapos" were responsible for the prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.

Sunday was not a work day, but the prisoners did not rest; they were required to clean the barracks and take their weekly shower. Prisoners were allowed to write (in German) to their families on Sundays. Inmates who did not speak German would trade some of their bread to another inmate for help composing their letters. Members of the SS censored the outgoing mail.
A second mandatory roll call took place in the evening. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, regardless of the weather conditions, even if it took hours. After roll call, individual and collective punishments were meted out, depending on what had happened during the day, before the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night and receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later. The prisoners slept in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen.

According to Nyiszli, "Eight hundred to a thousand people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other in an effort to get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".

The types of prisoners were distinguishable by triangular pieces of cloth, called "Winkel", sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the "Winkel". Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid by a second "Winkel" if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.

Prisoners received a hot drink in the morning, but no breakfast, and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they received a small ration of moldy bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning. Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines and a lack of fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. <a href="Noma%20%28disease%29">Noma</a>, a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished, was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.
<a href="Block%2011">Block 11</a> of Auschwitz I was the prison within the prison, where violators of the numerous rules were punished. Some prisoners were made to spend the nights in <a href="standing%20cell">standing cell</a>s. These cells were about , and held four men; they could do nothing but stand, and were forced during the day to work with the other prisoners. Prisoners sentenced to death for attempting to escape were confined in a dark cell and given neither food nor water while being left to die. 

In the basement were the "dark cells", which had only a very tiny window and a solid door. Prisoners placed in these cells gradually suffocated as they used up all the oxygen in the cell; sometimes the SS lit a candle in the cell to use up the oxygen more quickly. Many were subjected to hanging with their hands behind their backs for hours, even days, thus dislocating their shoulder joints.

On 31 July 1941, <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> gave written authorization to Heydrich, Chief of the <a href="RSHA">Reich Main Security Office</a> (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for "Die Endlösung der Judenfrage" (the <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a> of the <a href="Jewish%20question">Jewish question</a>) in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organizations. The resulting "<a href="Generalplan%20Ost">Generalplan Ost</a>" (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labor or to be murdered. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the <a href="Hunger%20Plan">Hunger Plan</a>. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.

Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalized at the <a href="Wannsee%20Conference">Wannsee Conference</a> on 20 January 1942. Some would be <a href="Extermination%20through%20labor">worked to death</a> and the rest would be killed. Initially the victims were killed with <a href="gas%20vans">gas vans</a> or by "<a href="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>" firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1942, killing centers at Auschwitz, <a href="Sobib%C3%B3r%20extermination%20camp">Sobibór</a>, <a href="Treblinka">Treblinka</a>, and other Nazi extermination camps replaced "Einsatzgruppen" as the primary method of mass killing.

The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz took place in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by gathering them in the basement of Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then were locked in the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.

Mass exterminations were moved to two provisional gas chambers (Bunkers 1 and 2), where the killings continued while the larger Crematoria II, III, IV, and V were under construction. Bunker 2 was temporarily reactivated from May to November 1944, when large numbers of Hungarian Jews were exterminated. In summer 1944 the capacity of the crematoria and outdoor incineration pits was 20,000 bodies per day. A planned sixth facility—Crematorium VI—was never built.

Prisoners were transported from all over German-occupied Europe by rail, arriving in daily convoys. By July 1942, the SS were conducting "selections". Incoming Jews were segregated; those deemed able to work were sent to the selection officer's right and admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labor were sent to the selection officer's left and immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit.

After the selection process was complete, those too ill or too young to walk to the crematoria were transported there on trucks or killed on the spot with a bullet to the head. The belongings of the arrivals were seized by the SS and sorted in an area of the camp called "Canada", so called because Canada was seen as a land of plenty. Many of the SS at the camp enriched themselves by pilfering the confiscated property.

SS officers told the victims they were to take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.

"Sonderkommando" wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, artificial limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer.

The gas chambers worked to their fullest capacity from April–July 1944, during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Hungary%23Occupation%20and%20deportation">massacre of Hungary's Jews</a>. Hungary was an ally of Germany during the war, but it had resisted turning over its Jews until Germany invaded that March. A rail spur leading directly into Birkenau was completed that May to deliver the victims closer to the gas chambers. From 14 May until early July 1944, 437,000 Hungarian Jews, half of the pre-war population, were deported to Auschwitz, at a rate of 12,000 a day for a considerable part of that period. The incoming volume was so great that the SS resorted to burning corpses in open-air pits as well as in the crematoria. The last selection took place on 30 October 1944.

German doctors performed a wide variety of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of <a href="X-rays">X-rays</a> as a <a href="forced%20sterilization">sterilization</a> device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr <a href="Carl%20Clauberg">Carl Clauberg</a> injected chemicals into women's <a href="uterus">uterus</a>es in an effort to glue them shut. <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a>, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as <a href="Human%20subject%20research">research subjects</a> for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.

The most infamous doctor at Auschwitz was <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>, known as the "Angel of Death". Particularly interested in research on <a href="identical%20twins">identical twins</a>, Mengele performed cruel experiments on them, such as inducing diseases in one twin and killing the other when the first died to perform comparative autopsies. He also took a special interest in dwarfs, and he deliberately induced <a href="Noma%20%28disease%29">noma</a> in twins, dwarfs, and other prisoners to study the effects.

<a href="Kurt%20Heissmeyer">Kurt Heissmeyer</a> took twenty Jewish children from Auschwitz to use in <a href="pseudoscientific">pseudoscientific</a> medical experiments at the <a href="Neuengamme%20concentration%20camp">Neuengamme concentration camp</a>. In April 1945, the children were killed by hanging to conceal the project.

A <a href="Jewish%20skeleton%20collection">skeleton collection</a> was obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish Auschwitz inmates, chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. <a href="Rudolf%20Brandt">Rudolf Brandt</a> and <a href="Wolfram%20Sievers">Wolfram Sievers</a>, general manager of the "<a href="Ahnenerbe">Ahnenerbe</a>" (a Nazi research institute), were responsible for delivering the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the <a href="Reichsuniversit%C3%A4t%20Stra%C3%9Fburg">Reich University of Strasbourg</a> in the <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> region of <a href="Occupied%20France">Occupied France</a>. The collection was sanctioned by Himmler and under the direction of <a href="August%20Hirt">August Hirt</a>. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to <a href="Natzweiler-Struthof">Natzweiler-Struthof</a> and killed in August 1943. Brandt and Sievers were later convicted in the <a href="Doctors%27%20Trial">Doctors' Trial</a> in Nuremberg.

The exact number of victims at Auschwitz is difficult to fix with certainty, because many prisoners were never registered and much evidence was destroyed by the SS in the final days of the war. As early as 1942, Himmler visited the camp and ordered that "all mass graves were to be opened and the corpses burned. In addition the ashes were to be disposed of in such a way that it would be impossible at some future time to calculate the number of corpses burned."

Shortly following the camp's liberation, the Soviet government stated that four million people had been killed on the site, a figure now regarded as greatly exaggerated. While under interrogation, Höss said that <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> told him that two and a half million Jews had been killed in gas chambers and about half a million more had died of other causes. Later he wrote, "I regard the figure of two and a half million as far too high. Even Auschwitz had limits to its destructive possibilities". <a href="Gerald%20Reitlinger">Gerald Reitlinger</a>'s 1953 book "The Final Solution" estimated the number killed to be 800,000 to 900,000, and <a href="Raul%20Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a>'s 1961 work "<a href="The%20Destruction%20of%20the%20European%20Jews">The Destruction of the European Jews</a>" estimated the number killed to be a maximum of 1,000,000 Jewish victims. French chemist and author <a href="Jean-Claude%20Pressac">Jean-Claude Pressac</a> estimates that between 631,000 and 711,000 killed at Auschwitz, of whom 470,000 to 550,000 were gassed.

In 1983, French scholar George Wellers was one of the first to use German data on deportations to estimate the number killed at Auschwitz, arriving at a figure of 1,471,595 deaths, including 1.35 million Jews and 86,675 Poles. A larger study started by <a href="Franciszek%20Piper">Franciszek Piper</a> used timetables of train arrivals combined with deportation records to calculate at least 960,000 Jewish deaths and at least 1.1 million total deaths, a figure adopted as official by the <a href="Auschwitz-Birkenau%20State%20Museum">Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum</a> in the 1990s. Piper stated that a figure of as many as 1.5 million total deaths was possible.

By nation, the greatest number of Auschwitz's Jewish victims were from Hungary, accounting for 438,000 deaths, followed by <a href="Polish%20Jews">Polish Jews</a> (300,000 deaths), French (69,000), Dutch (60,000), and Greek (55,000). Fewer than one percent of Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been driven from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944. Approximately 1 in 6 Jews killed in the Holocaust died at the camp.

The next largest group of victims were non-Jewish Poles, who accounted for 70,000 to 75,000 deaths. Twenty-one thousand Roma and Sinti were killed, along with 15,000 Soviet POWs and 10,000 to 15,000 peoples of other nations. Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps of which an unknown number were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.

Inmates were at times able to distribute information from the camp to the outside world via messages used in shortwave radio transmissions. The <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> in London first reported the gassing of prisoners on 21 July 1942. However, these reports were for a long time disregarded as exaggerated or unreliable by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied Powers</a>, Germany's opponents in the West. Information regarding Auschwitz was also available to the Allies during the years 1940–43 by the accurate and frequent reports of Polish <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a> (Armia Krajowa) Captain <a href="Witold%20Pilecki">Witold Pilecki</a>. Pilecki was the only known person to volunteer to be imprisoned at Auschwitz concentration camp, spending 945 days there. He gathered evidence of genocide and organized resistance structures known as <a href="Zwi%C4%85zek%20Organizacji%20Wojskowej">Związek Organizacji Wojskowej</a> (ZOW) at the camp. His first report was smuggled to the outside world in November 1940, through an inmate who was released from the camp. He eventually escaped on 27 April 1943, but his personal report of mass killings was dismissed as exaggeration by the Allies, as were his previous reports.

The first information about Auschwitz concentration camp was published in winter 1940–41 in the Polish underground newspapers "" (Poland Lives) and "<a href="Biuletyn%20Informacyjny">Biuletyn Informacyjny</a>" (Newsletter). From 1942, members of the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Information%20and%20Propaganda">Bureau of Information and Propaganda</a> of the Warsaw area <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a> published in occupied Poland a few brochures based on the accounts of escapees. The first of these was a fictional memoir "Oświęcim. Pamiętnik więźnia" (Auschwitz: Diary of a prisoner), written by <a href="Halina%20Krahelska">Halina Krahelska</a> and published in April 1942 in Warsaw. Also published in 1942 were the books "Auschwitz: obóz śmierci" (Auschwitz: Camp of Death) written by , and "W piekle" (In Hell) by <a href="Zofia%20Kossak-Szczucka">Zofia Kossak-Szczucka</a>, the Polish writer, social activist and founder of <a href="%C5%BBegota">Żegota</a>.

In 1943, the "Kampfgruppe Auschwitz" (Combat Group Auschwitz) was organized with the aim of sending out information about what was happening. "Sonderkommandos" buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.

The attitude of the Allies changed with receipt of the detailed, 32-page <a href="Vrba%E2%80%93Wetzler%20report">Vrba–Wetzler report</a>, compiled by two Jewish prisoners, <a href="Rudolf%20Vrba">Rudolf Vrba</a> and <a href="Alfr%C3%A9d%20Wetzler">Alfréd Wetzler</a>, who escaped on 7 April 1944. This report finally convinced Allied leaders that mass killings were taking place in Auschwitz.
Details from the Vrba-Wetzler report were released to the Swiss press by diplomat <a href="George%20Mantello">George Mantello</a> and printed on 6 June by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". Auschwitz Plans originating with the Polish government were provided to the U.K foreign ministry in August 1944. A Polish report about Auschwitz titled "Oswiecim, Camp of Death (Underground Report)" with a foreword by <a href="Florence%20Jaffray%20Harriman">Florence Jaffray Harriman</a> was published in English by the Polish Labor Group in New York in March 1944, prior to the camp's liberation. Gassing of prisoners from 1942 was described in this report.

Starting with a plea from the Slovakian rabbi <a href="Chaim%20Michael%20Dov%20Weissmandl">Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl</a> in May 1944, there was a growing campaign by Jewish organizations to persuade the Allies to bomb Auschwitz or the railway lines leading to it. At one point British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> ordered that such a plan be prepared, but he was told that precision bombing the camp to free the prisoners or disrupt the railway was not technically feasible.

In 1978, historian David S. Wyman published an essay titled "Why Auschwitz Was Never Bombed", arguing that the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> had the capability to attack Auschwitz and should have done so; books by <a href="Bernard%20Wasserstein">Bernard Wasserstein</a> and <a href="Martin%20Gilbert">Martin Gilbert</a> raised similar questions about British inaction. Since the 1990s, other historians have argued that Allied bombing accuracy was not sufficient for Wyman's proposed attack, and that <a href="counterfactual%20history">counterfactual history</a> is an inherently problematic endeavor. <a href="Auschwitz%20bombing%20debate">The controversy over this decision</a> has lasted to the present day in both countries.

At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.

A daring escape from Auschwitz was staged on 20 June 1942 by four Polish prisoners: Eugeniusz Bendera (auto mechanic at the camp), <a href="Kazimierz%20Piechowski">Kazimierz Piechowski</a>, Stanisław Gustaw Jaster, and Józef Lempart. After breaking into a warehouse, the four dressed as members of the "<a href="SS-Totenkopfverb%C3%A4nde">SS-Totenkopfverbände</a>" (the SS units responsible for concentration camps), armed themselves, and stole an SS staff car, which they then drove unchallenged through the main gate.

On 24 June 1944, a Belgian-Polish Jew, <a href="Mala%20Zimetbaum">Mala Zimetbaum</a>, escaped with her Polish boyfriend, Edek Galiński, dressed in a stolen prisoner-guard uniform. They were later recaptured, tortured, and executed by the SS. On 21 July 1944, inmate <a href="Jerzy%20Bielecki%20%28Auschwitz%20survivor%29">Jerzy Bielecki</a>, dressed in an SS uniform and using a faked pass, managed to cross the camp's gate together with his Jewish girlfriend, Cyla. Both survived the war.

The "Sonderkommando" units were aware that as witnesses to the killings, they themselves would eventually be killed to hide Nazi crimes. Though they knew that it would mean their deaths, the "Sonderkommandos" of Birkenau "Kommando" III staged an uprising on 7 October 1944, following an announcement that some of them would be selected to be "transferred to another camp"—a common Nazi ruse for the murder of prisoners. The "Sonderkommandos" attacked the SS guards with stones, axes, and makeshift hand grenades. As the SS set up machine guns to attack the prisoners in Crematorium IV, the "Sonderkommandos" in Crematorium II also revolted, some of them managing to escape the compound. The rebellion was suppressed by nightfall.

Ultimately, three SS guards were killed — one of whom was burned alive by the prisoners in the oven of Crematorium II — and 451 "Sonderkommandos" were killed. Hundreds of prisoners escaped, but were all soon captured and executed, along with an additional group who participated in the revolt. Crematorium IV was destroyed in the fighting, and a group of prisoners in the gas chamber of Crematorium V was spared in the chaos.

In the decades since its liberation, Auschwitz has become a primary symbol of the Holocaust. Historian <a href="Timothy%20D.%20Snyder">Timothy D. Snyder</a> attributes this to the camp's high death toll as well as to its "unusual combination of an industrial camp complex and a killing facility", which left behind far more witnesses than single-purpose killing facilities such as <a href="Che%C5%82mno%20extermination%20camp">Chełmno</a> or <a href="Treblinka%20extermination%20camp">Treblinka</a>. The <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> has designated 27 January, the date of the camp's liberation, as <a href="International%20Holocaust%20Remembrance%20Day">International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>. In a speech on the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation, German chancellor <a href="Helmut%20Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a> described Auschwitz as the "darkest and most horrific chapter of German history".

Notable memoirists of the camp include <a href="Primo%20Levi">Primo Levi</a>, <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, and <a href="Tadeusz%20Borowski">Tadeusz Borowski</a>. In "<a href="If%20This%20Is%20a%20Man">If This Is a Man</a>", Levi wrote that the concentration camps represented the epitome of the totalitarian system:
Psychiatrist <a href="Viktor%20Frankl">Viktor Frankl</a> drew on his imprisonment at Auschwitz in composing "<a href="Man%27s%20Search%20for%20Meaning">Man's Search for Meaning</a>" (1946), one of the most widely read works about the camp. An <a href="existentialist">existentialist</a> work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in "<a href="Night%20%28book%29">Night</a>" (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>.

Camp survivor <a href="Simone%20Veil">Simone Veil</a> was later elected President of the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>, serving from 1979–82. Two Auschwitz victims—<a href="Maximilian%20Kolbe">Maximilian Kolbe</a>, a priest who volunteered to die by starvation in place of a stranger, and <a href="Edith%20Stein">Edith Stein</a>, a Jewish convert to Catholicism—were later named saints of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

On 2 July 1947, the Polish government passed a law, establishing a state memorial to the victims of Nazism on the site of the camp. In 1955, an exhibition opened, displaying prisoner <a href="mug%20shot">mug shot</a>s; hair, suitcases, and shoes taken from murdered prisoners; canisters of Zyklon B pellets; and other objects related to the killings. <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> added the camp to its list of <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s in 1979. In 2011, the museum drew 1,400,000 visitors.

Pope <a href="John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a> celebrated <a href="Mass%20%28Roman%20Rite%29">mass</a> over the train tracks leading to the camp on 7 June 1979. In the decades following his visit, controversies erupted over a group of <a href="Carmelite">Carmelite</a> nuns founding a convent on the site and <a href="Auschwitz%20cross">erecting a large cross</a> originally used in the pope's mass. Protesters objected to what they saw as Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.

On 4 September 2003, three <a href="Israeli%20Air%20Force">Israeli Air Force</a> <a href="F-15%20Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a>s performed a fly-over of Auschwitz-Birkenau during a ceremony at the camp below. The flight was led by Major-General <a href="Amir%20Eshel">Amir Eshel</a>, the son of Holocaust survivors. On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors and other guests gathered under a giant tent at the entrance to Auschwitz II Birkenau to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Attendees included president of the <a href="World%20Jewish%20Congress">World Jewish Congress</a> <a href="Ronald%20Lauder">Ronald Lauder</a>, film director <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, and world leaders such as Polish president <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Komorowski">Bronisław Komorowski</a> and King <a href="Willem-Alexander%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands</a>. As the number of remaining survivors decreases each year, the attendance at the event is unlikely to be surpassed at future major anniversaries.

Museum curators consider visitors who pick up items from the ground to be thieves, and local police will charge them as such. The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of ten years. On 22 June 2015, two British youths from the <a href="The%20Perse%20School">Perse School</a> were convicted of theft after picking up buttons and shards of decorative glass they found on the ground near the area where camp victims' confiscated personal effects were stored. The boys, both 17 years old, received probation and were fined £170, but later appealed the sentence. Curators said that similar incidents happen once or twice a year.

Some of the roads among postwar buildings nearby are named commemoratively, for example Więżniów Oświęcimia (translates as "Of the prisoners of Oświęcim"), Obozowa ("Of the camps"), Ostatni Etap ("Last Stage"), Spóldzielców ("Of the co-workers"), Ofiar Faszyzmu ("Of the victims of fascism"), Piwniczna ("Pertaining to the cellar(s) or basement(s)"), Wyzwolenia ("Liberation"), Maximiliana Kolbego ("of <a href="Maximilian%20Kolbe">Maximilian Kolbe</a>"). Stefana Jaracza ("of <a href="Stefan%20Jaracz">Stefan Jaracz</a>").
